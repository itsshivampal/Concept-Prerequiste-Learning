12.4. Nonlinear Latent Variable Models
In this chapter, we have focussed on the simplest class of models having continuous
latent variables, namely those based on linear-Gaussian distributions. As well as
having great practical importance, these models are relatively easy to analyse and
to ﬁt to data and can also be used as components in more complex models. Here
we consider brieﬂy some generalizations of this framework to models that are either
nonlinear or non-Gaussian, or both.
In fact, the issues of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity are related because a
general probability density can be obtained from a simple ﬁxed reference density,
such as a Gaussian, by making a nonlinear change of variables. This idea forms the
basis of several practical latent variable models as we shall see shortly.
