For the linear regression model with a Gaussian noise distribution, the error
function, corresponding to the negative log likelihood, is given by (3.12). If we take
the derivative with respect to the parameter vector w of the contribution to the error
function from a data point n, this takes the form of the ‘error’ yn − tn times the
feature vector φn, where yn = wTφn. Similarly, for the combination of the logistic
sigmoid activation function and the cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the
softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108),
we again obtain this same simple form. We now show that this is a general result
of assuming a conditional distribution for the target variable from the exponential
family, along with a corresponding choice for the activation function known as the
canonical link function.
We again make use of the restricted form (4.84) of exponential family distribu-
tions. Note that here we are applying the assumption of exponential family distribu-
tion to the target variable t, in contrast to Section 4.2.4 where we applied it to the
input vector x. We therefore consider conditional distributions of the target variable
of the form
p(t|η, s) =
1
s
h
t
s
g(η) exp
(4.118)
ηt
s
Using the same line of argument as led to the derivation of the result (2.226), we see
that the conditional mean of t, which we denote by y, is given by
y ≡ E[t|η] = −s
d
dη
ln g(η).
