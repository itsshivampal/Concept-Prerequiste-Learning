We have already encountered the concept of a conjugate prior several times, for
example in the context of the Bernoulli distribution (for which the conjugate prior
is the beta distribution) or the Gaussian (where the conjugate prior for the mean is
a Gaussian, and the conjugate prior for the precision is the Wishart distribution). In
general, for a given probability distribution p(x|η), we can seek a prior p(η) that is
conjugate to the likelihood function, so that the posterior distribution has the same
functional form as the prior. For any member of the exponential family (2.194), there
exists a conjugate prior that can be written in the form
p(η|χ, ν) = f(χ, ν)g(η)ν exp
(2.229)
νηTχ
where f(χ, ν) is a normalization coefficient, and g(η) is the same function as ap-
pears in (2.194). To see that this is indeed conjugate, let us multiply the prior (2.229)
by the likelihood function (2.227) to obtain the posterior distribution, up to a nor-
malization coefficient, in the form
p(η|X, χ, ν) ∝ g(η)ν+N exp
ηT
n=1
u(xn) + νχ
(2.230)
This again takes the same functional form as the prior (2.229), confirming conjugacy.
Furthermore, we see that the parameter ν can be interpreted as a effective number of
pseudo-observations in the prior, each of which has a value for the sufficient statistic
u(x) given by χ.
