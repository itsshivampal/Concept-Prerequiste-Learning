Let us now consider the problem of estimating the parameter vector η in the gen-
eral exponential family distribution (2.194) using the technique of maximum likeli-
hood. Taking the gradient of both sides of (2.195) with respect to η, we have
h(x) exp
ηTu(x)
∇g(η)
+ g(η)
h(x) exp
ηTu(x)
u(x) dx = 0.
Rearranging, and making use again of (2.195) then gives
1
g(η)∇g(η) = g(η)
h(x) exp
ηTu(x)
u(x) dx = E[u(x)]
where we have used (2.194). We therefore obtain the result
−∇ ln g(η) = E[u(x)].
Note that the covariance of u(x) can be expressed in terms of the second derivatives
of g(η), and similarly for higher order moments. Thus, provided we can normalize a
distribution from the exponential family, we can always find its moments by simple
differentiation.
Now consider a set of independent identically distributed data denoted by X =
{x1, . . . , xn}, for which the likelihood function is given by
p(X|η) =
h(xn)
n=1
g(η)N exp
u(xn)
(2.227)
n=1
Setting the gradient of ln p(X|η) with respect to η to zero, we get the following
condition to be satisfied by the maximum likelihood estimator ηML
−∇ ln g(ηML) =

which can in principle be solved to obtain ηML. We see that the solution for the
n u(xn), which
maximum likelihood estimator depends on the data only through
is therefore called the sufficient statistic of the distribution (2.194). We do not need
to store the entire data set itself but only the value of the sufficient statistic. For
the Bernoulli distribution, for example, the function u(x) is given just by x and
so we need only keep the sum of the data points {xn}, whereas for the Gaussian
u(x) = (x, x2)T, and so we should keep both the sum of {xn} and the sum of {x2
n}.
If we consider the limit N → ∞, then the right-hand side of (2.228) becomes
E[u(x)], and so by comparing with (2.226) we see that in this limit ηML will equal
the true value η.
In fact, this sufficiency property holds also for Bayesian inference, although
we shall defer discussion of this until Chapter 8 when we have equipped ourselves
with the tools of graphical models and can thereby gain a deeper insight into these
important concepts.
