We now introduce a family of prior distributions for the parameters {µk} of
the multinomial distribution (2.34). By inspection of the form of the multinomial
distribution, we see that the conjugate prior is given by
mk = N.
p(µ|α) ∝

where 0 � µk � 1 and
k µk = 1. Here α1, . . . , αK are the parameters of the
distribution, and α denotes (α1, . . . , αK)T. Note that, because of the summation
constraint, the distribution over the space of the {µk} is confined to a simplex of
dimensionality K − 1, as illustrated for K = 3 in Figure 2.4.
The normalized form for this distribution is by
Dir(µ|α) =

which is called the Dirichlet distribution. Here Γ(x) is the gamma function defined
by (1.141) while

2.2. Multinomial Variables
Figure 2.4 The Dirichlet distribution over three variables µ1, µ2, µ3
is confined to a simplex (a bounded linear manifold) of
the form shown, as a consequence of the constraints
0 � µk � 1 and
k µk = 1.

Plots of the Dirichlet distribution over the simplex, for various settings of the param-
eters αk, are shown in Figure 2.5.
Multiplying the prior (2.38) by the likelihood function (2.34), we obtain the
posterior distribution for the parameters {µk} in the form
p(µ|D, α) ∝ p(D|µ)p(µ|α) ∝
k=1
µαk+mk−1
k
(2.40)
We see that the posterior distribution again takes the form of a Dirichlet distribution,
confirming that the Dirichlet is indeed a conjugate prior for the multinomial. This
allows us to determine the normalization coefficient by comparison with (2.38) so
that
p(µ|D, α) = Dir(µ|α + m)
Γ(α0 + N)
Γ(α1 + m1)··· Γ(αK + mK)
k=1
µαk+mk−1

(2.41)
where we have denoted m = (m1, . . . , mK)T. As for the case of the binomial
distribution with its beta prior, we can interpret the parameters αk of the Dirichlet
prior as an effective number of observations of xk = 1.

Lejeune Dirichlet
1805–1859
Lejeune
Johann Peter Gustav
Dirichlet was a modest and re-
served mathematician who made
contributions in number theory, me-
chanics, and astronomy, and who
gave the first rigorous analysis of
Fourier series. His family originated from Richelet
in Belgium, and the name Lejeune Dirichlet comes
from ‘le jeune de Richelet’ (the young person from
Richelet). Dirichlet’s first paper, which was published
in 1825, brought him instant fame. It concerned Fer-
mat’s last theorem, which claims that there are no
positive integer solutions to xn + yn = zn for n > 2.
Dirichlet gave a partial proof for the case n = 5, which
was sent to Legendre for review and who in turn com-
pleted the proof. Later, Dirichlet gave a complete proof
for n = 14, although a full proof of Fermat’s last theo-
rem for arbitrary n had to wait until the work of Andrew
Wiles in the closing years of the 20th century.

in the plane of the simplex and the vertical axis corresponds to the value of the density. Here {αk} = 0.1 on the
