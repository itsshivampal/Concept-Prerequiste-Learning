The predictive distribution over t, given a new input x, is easily evaluated for
this model using the Gaussian variational posterior for the parameters
p(t|x, t) =
= N (t|mT
p(t|x, w)p(w|t) dw
p(t|x, w)q(w) dw
N (t|wTφ(x), β−1)N (w|mN , SN ) dw
N φ(x), σ2(x))

10.3. Variational Linear Regression

where we have evaluated the integral by making use of the result (2.115) for the
linear-Gaussian model. Here the input-dependent variance is given by
σ2(x) =
+ φ(x)TSN φ(x).
(10.106)
Note that this takes the same form as the result (3.59) obtained with fixed α except
that now the expected value E[α] appears in the definition of SN .
