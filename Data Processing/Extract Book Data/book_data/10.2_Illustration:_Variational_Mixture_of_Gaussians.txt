Figure 10.5 Directed acyclic graph representing the Bayesian mix-
ture of Gaussians model, in which the box (plate) de-
notes a set of N i.i.d. observations. Here µ denotes
{µk} and Λ denotes {Λk}.

by (B.23). As we have seen, the parameter α0 can be interpreted as the effective
prior number of observations associated with each component of the mixture. If the
value of α0 is small, then the posterior distribution will be influenced primarily by
the data rather than by the prior.
Similarly, we introduce an independent Gaussian-Wishart prior governing the
mean and precision of each Gaussian component, given by
p(µ, Λ) = p(µ|Λ)p(Λ)

(10.40)
because this represents the conjugate prior distribution when both the mean and pre-
cision are unknown. Typically we would choose m0 = 0 by symmetry.
The resulting model can be represented as a directed graph as shown in Fig-
ure 10.5. Note that there is a link from Λ to µ since the variance of the distribution
over µ in (10.40) is a function of Λ.
This example provides a nice illustration of the distinction between latent vari-
ables and parameters. Variables such as zn that appear inside the plate are regarded
as latent variables because the number of such variables grows with the size of the
data set. By contrast, variables such as µ that are outside the plate are fixed in
number independently of the size of the data set, and so are regarded as parameters.
From the perspective of graphical models, however, there is really no fundamental
difference between them.
