We now illustrate the use of local variational methods by returning to the Bayesian
logistic regression model studied in Section 4.5. There we focussed on the use of
the Laplace approximation, while here we consider a variational treatment based on
the approach of Jaakkola and Jordan (2000). Like the Laplace method, this also
leads to a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. However, the greater
flexibility of the variational approximation leads to improved accuracy compared
to the Laplace method. Furthermore (unlike the Laplace method), the variational
approach is optimizing a well defined objective function given by a rigourous bound
on the model evidence. Logistic regression has also been treated by Dybowski and
Roberts (2005) from a Bayesian perspective using Monte Carlo sampling techniques.
