We have seen that if a joint distribution p(xa, xb) is Gaussian, then the condi-
tional distribution p(xa|xb) will again be Gaussian. Now we turn to a discussion of
the marginal distribution given by
p(xa) =
p(xa, xb) dxb
(2.83)
which, as we shall see, is also Gaussian. Once again, our strategy for evaluating this
distribution efficiently will be to focus on the quadratic form in the exponent of the
joint distribution and thereby to identify the mean and covariance of the marginal
distribution p(xa).
The quadratic form for the joint distribution can be expressed, using the par-
titioned precision matrix, in the form (2.70). Because our goal is to integrate out
xb, this is most easily achieved by first considering the terms involving xb and then
completing the square in order to facilitate integration. Picking out just those terms
that involve xb, we have

m = Λbbµb − Λba(xa − µa).

We see that the dependence on xb has been cast into the standard quadratic form of a
Gaussian distribution corresponding to the first term on the right-hand side of (2.84),
plus a term that does not depend on xb (but that does depend on xa). Thus, when
we take the exponential of this quadratic form, we see that the integration over xb
required by (2.83) will take the form
exp

(xb − Λ−1
bb m)TΛbb(xb − Λ−1

dxb.
(2.86)
This integration is easily performed by noting that it is the integral over an unnor-
malized Gaussian, and so the result will be the reciprocal of the normalization co-
efficient. We know from the form of the normalized Gaussian given by (2.43), that
this coefficient is independent of the mean and depends only on the determinant of
the covariance matrix. Thus, by completing the square with respect to xb, we can
integrate out xb and the only term remaining from the contributions on the left-hand
side of (2.84) that depends on xa is the last term on the right-hand side of (2.84) in
which m is given by (2.85). Combining this term with the remaining terms from

where ‘const’ denotes quantities independent of xa. Again, by comparison with
(2.71), we see that the covariance of the marginal distribution of p(xa) is given by
Similarly, the mean is given by
Σa = (Λaa − ΛabΛ−1
bb Λba)−1.
Σa(Λaa − ΛabΛ−1
bb Λba)µa = µa
where we have used (2.88). The covariance in (2.88) is expressed in terms of the
partitioned precision matrix given by (2.69). We can rewrite this in terms of the
corresponding partitioning of the covariance matrix given by (2.67), as we did for
the conditional distribution. These partitioned matrices are related by
Making use of (2.76), we then have
Thus we obtain the intuitively satisfying result that the marginal distribution p(xa)
has mean and covariance given by
Λaa Λab
Λba Λbb

Σaa Σab
Σba Σbb
Λaa − ΛabΛ−1
bb Λba
−1 = Σaa.
E[xa] = µa
cov[xa] = Σaa.
We see that for a marginal distribution, the mean and covariance are most simply ex-
pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix, in contrast to the conditional
distribution for which the partitioned precision matrix gives rise to simpler expres-
sions.
Our results for the marginal and conditional distributions of a partitioned Gaus-
sian are summarized below.
