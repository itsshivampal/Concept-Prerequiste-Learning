Section 9.2
It is important to distinguish between model combination methods and Bayesian
model averaging, as the two are often confused. To understand the difference, con-
sider the example of density estimation using a mixture of Gaussians in which several
Gaussian components are combined probabilistically. The model contains a binary
latent variable z that indicates which component of the mixture is responsible for
generating the corresponding data point. Thus the model is specified in terms of a
joint distribution
(14.2)
and the corresponding density over the observed variable x is obtained by marginal-
izing over the latent variable
p(x, z)
p(x) =
p(x, z).

In the case of our Gaussian mixture example, this leads to a distribution of the form
