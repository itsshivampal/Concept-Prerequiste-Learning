Figure 8.26 The Markov blanket of a node xi comprises the set
of parents, children and co-parents of the node.
It
has the property that the conditional distribution of
xi, conditioned on all the remaining variables in the
graph, is dependent only on the variables in the
Markov blanket.
xi
of xi as well as on the co-parents, in other words variables corresponding to parents
of node xk other than node xi. The set of nodes comprising the parents, the children
and the co-parents is called the Markov blanket and is illustrated in Figure 8.26. We
can think of the Markov blanket of a node xi as being the minimal set of nodes that
isolates xi from the rest of the graph. Note that it is not sufficient to include only the
parents and children of node xi because the phenomenon of explaining away means
that observations of the child nodes will not block paths to the co-parents. We must
therefore observe the co-parent nodes also.
8.3. Markov Random Fields
We have seen that directed graphical models specify a factorization of the joint dis-
tribution over a set of variables into a product of local conditional distributions. They
also define a set of conditional independence properties that must be satisfied by any
distribution that factorizes according to the graph. We turn now to the second ma-
jor class of graphical models that are described by undirected graphs and that again
specify both a factorization and a set of conditional independence relations.
A Markov random field, also known as a Markov network or an undirected
graphical model (Kindermann and Snell, 1980), has a set of nodes each of which
corresponds to a variable or group of variables, as well as a set of links each of
which connects a pair of nodes. The links are undirected, that is they do not carry
arrows. In the case of undirected graphs, it is convenient to begin with a discussion
of conditional independence properties.
