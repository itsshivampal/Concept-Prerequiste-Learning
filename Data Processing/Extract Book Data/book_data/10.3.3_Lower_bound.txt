Another quantity of importance is the lower bound L defined by
L(q) = E[ln p(w, α, t)] − E[ln q(w, α)]
−Eα[ln q(w)]w − E[ln q(α)].
= Ew[ln p(t|w)] + Ew,α[ln p(w|α)] + Eα[ln p(α)]

Figure 10.9 shows a plot of the lower bound L(q) versus the degree of a polynomial
model for a synthetic data set generated from a degree three polynomial. Here the
prior parameters have been set to a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding to the noninformative
prior p(α) ∝ 1/α, which is uniform over ln α as discussed in Section 2.3.6. As
we saw in Section 10.1, the quantity L represents lower bound on the log marginal
likelihood p(t|M) for the model. If we assign equal prior probabilities p(M) to the
different values of M, then we can interpret L as an approximation to the poste-
rior model probability p(M|t). Thus the variational framework assigns the highest
probability to the model with M = 3. This should be contrasted with the maximum
likelihood result, which assigns ever smaller residual error to models of increasing
complexity until the residual error is driven to zero, causing maximum likelihood to
favour severely over-fitted models.

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE
Figure 10.9 Plot of
the lower bound L ver-
sus the order M of the polyno-
mial, for a polynomial model, in
which a set of 10 data points is
generated from a polynomial with
M = 3 sampled over the inter-
val (−5, 5) with additive Gaussian
noise of variance 0.09. The value
of the bound gives the log prob-
ability of the model, and we see
that the value of the bound peaks
at M = 3, corresponding to the
true model from which the data
set was generated.
