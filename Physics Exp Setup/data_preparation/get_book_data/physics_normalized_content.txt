1|What is Physics?|3
Physics is the study of the world around us. In sense we are more qualified to do Physics than any other science. From the day we are born we study the things around us in an effort to understand how they Work (physics) and relate to each other. Learning how to catch or throw ball is Physics undertaking for example. In the Field (physics) of study we refer to as Physics we just try to make the things everyone has been studying more clear. We attempt to describe them through simple rules and mathematics. Mathematics is merely the language we use. The best approach to Physics is to relate everything you learn to things you have already noticed in your everyday life. Sometimes when you look at things closely you discover things you had overlooked intially. It is the continued scrutiny of everything we know about the world around us that leads people to the lifelong study of Physics You can start with asking simple question like Why is the sky blue? which could lead you to electromagnetic Wave which in turn could lead you Wave particle duality and to Energy level of atoms and before long you are studying quantum mechanics or the structure of the universe. In the sections that follow notice that we will try to describe how we will communicate the things we are dealing with. This is our langauge. Once this is done we can begin the adventure of looking more closely at the world we live in. ntsDescriptions relating to these questions must be included: What is meant by theory? How does hypothesis become part of law? (a) Define the term laboratory. (b) How does your schools Physics laboratory fit this definition? Distinguish between science and technology.

---------------------------------------------------------

2.1|Introduction|9
Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy fabric. The shop assistant would need to know how much fabric you needed. Telling her you need fabric wide and long would be insufficient you have to specify the unit (i.e. Metre wide and Metre long). Without the unit the information is incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were making curtains for dolls house the dimensions might be centimetres wide and centimetres long It is not just Length that have units all Physical quantity have units (e.g. time Temperature Distance etc.). Definition: Physical quantity Physical quantity is anything that you can measure. For example Length Temperature Distance and time are Physical quantity 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.2|Unit Systems|9

---------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1|SI Units|9
We will be using the SI units in this course. SI units are the internationally agreed upon units. Historically these units are based on the metric system which was developed in France at the time of the French Revolution. Definition: SI Units The name SI units comes from the French Systeme International dUnites which means international system of units. There are seven base SI units. These are listed in Table 2.1. All Physical quantity have units which can be built from these seven base units. These seven units were defined to be the base units. So it is possible to create different set of units by defining different set of base units. These seven units are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations of the other six. This is identical to bricks and concrete being the base units of building. You can build different things using different combinations of bricks and concrete. The 26 letters of the alphabet are the base units for language like English. Many different words can be formed by using these letters. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.2.2|The Other Systems of Units|10
The SI Units are not the only units available but they are most widely used. In Science there are three other sets of units that can also be used. These are mentioned here for interest only. c.g.s Units In the c.g.s. system the Metre is replaced by the centimetre and the Kilogram is replaced by the gram. This is simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For example the units of Force and Work (physics) are different. These units are used most often in astrophysics and atomic Physics Imperial Units Imperial units arose when kings and queens decided the measures that were to be used in the land. All the imperial base units except for the measure of time are different to those of SI units. This is the unit system you are most likely to encounter if SI units are not used. Examples of imperial units are pounds miles gallons and yards. These units are used by the Americans and British. As you can imagine having different units in use from place to place makes scientific communication very difficult. This was the motivation for adopting set of internationally agreed upon units. Natural Units This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities (such as the Speed of Light are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high Energy Physics and quantum mechanics. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.3|Writing Units as Words or Symbols|10
Unit names are always written with lowercase first letter for example we write Metre and litre. The symbols or abbreviations of units are also written with lowercase initials for example for Metre and for litre. The exception to this rule is if the unit is named after person then the symbol is capital letter. For example the kelvin was named after Lord Kelvin and its symbol is K. If the abbreviation of the unit that is named after person has two letters the second letter is lowercase for example Hertz for Hertz 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.4|Combinations of SI Base Units|12
To make Work (physics) with units easier some combinations of the base units are given special names but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 2.2 lists some examples of combinations of SI base units that are assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar at this stage we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as well as many others) It is very important that you are able to recognise the units correctly. For instance the new- ton (N) is another name for the Kilogram Metre per second squared (kgms2) while the Kilogram Metre squared per second squared (kgm2 s2) is called the Joule (J). Important: When writing combinations of base SI units place dot () between the units to indicate that different base units are used. For example the symbol for Metre per second is correctly written as ms1 and not as ms1 or ms. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.5|Rounding, Scientific Notation and Significant Figures|12

---------------------------------------------------------

2.5.1|Rounding Off|12
Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is that impossible but writing numbers out to high accuracy (many decimal places) is very inconvenient and rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number to certain number of decimal places. Rounding off or approximating decimal number to given number of decimal places is the quickest way to approximate number. For example if you wanted to round-off 26525272 to three decimal places then you would first count three places after the decimal. 2652|5272 All numbers to the right of are ignored after you determine whether the number in the third decimal place must be rounded up or rounded down. You round up the final digit (make the digit one more) if the first digit after the was greater or equal to and round down (leave the digit alone) otherwise. So since the first digit after the is we must round up the digit in the third decimal place to and the final answer of 26525272 rounded to three decimal places is 2653. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.5.2|Error Margins|13
In calculation that has many steps it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end. For example Jack and Jill walks to school. They walk 09 kilometers to get to school and it takes them 17 minutes. We can calculate their Speed in the following two ways. You will see that we get two different answers. In Method no rounding was done but in Method the time was rounded to decimal places. This made big difference to the answer. The answer in Method is more accurate because rounded numbers were not used in the calculation. Always only round off your final answer. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.5.3|Scientific Notation|13
In Science one often needs to Work (physics) with very large or very small numbers. These can be written more easily in scientific notation in the general form 10e where is decimal number between and 10 that is rounded off to few decimal places. is known as the exponent and is an integer. If it represents how many times the decimal place in should be moved to the right. If then it represents how many times the decimal place in should be moved to the left. For example 324 103 represents 3240 (the decimal moved three places to the right) and 324 103 represents 000324 (the decimal moved three places to the left). If number must be converted into scientific notation we need to Work (physics) out how many times the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it into number between and 10 (i.e. the value of e) and what this number between and 10 is (the value of d). We do this by counting the number of decimal places the decimal comma must move. For example write the Speed of Light in scientific notation to two decimal places. The Speed of Light is 299 792 458 ms1. First find where the decimal comma must go for two decimal places (to find d) and then count how many places there are after the decimal comma to determine e. In this example the decimal comma must go after the first but since the number after the is 300. because there are digits left after the decimal comma. So the Speed of Light in scientific notation to two decimal places is 300 108 ms1. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.5.4|Significant Figures|15
In number each non-zero digit is significant figure. Zeroes are only counted if they are between two non-zero digits or are at the end of the decimal part. For example the number 2000 has significant figure (the 2) but 20000 has significant figures. You estimate number like this by removing significant figures from the number (starting from the right) until you have the desired number of significant figures rounding as you go. For example 6827 has significant figures but if you wish to write it to significant figures it would mean removing the and rounding up so it would be 683. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.6|Prefixes of Base Units|15
Now that you know how to write numbers in scientific notation another important aspect of units is the prefixes that are used with the units. Definition: Prefix prefix is group of letters that are placed in front of word. The effect of the prefix is to change meaning of the word. For example the prefix un is often added to word to mean not as in unnecessary which means not necessary. In the case of units the prefixes have special use. The Kilogram Kilogram is simple example. Kilogram is equal to 000 or 103 g. Grouping the 103 and the together we can replace the 103 with the prefix (kilo). Therefore the takes the place of the 103. The Kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing prefix. In Science all the prefixes used with units are some Power (physics) of 10. Table 2.4 lists some of these prefixes. You will not use most of these prefixes but those prefixes listed in bold should be learnt. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where letter features twice in the table it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. For example means mega (106) and means milli (103). 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.7|The Importance of Units|17
Without units much of our Work (physics) as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the numbers we measure and calculate. Depending on which units we use the numbers are different. For example if you have 12 water it means nothing. You could have 12 ml of water 12 litres of water or even 12 bottles of water. Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be specified when expressing Physical quantity Imagine that you are baking cake but the units like grams and millilitres for the flour milk sugar and baking powder are not specified 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.8|How to Change Units|17
It is very important that you are aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore you must be able to convert between units. Being able to change between units (for example converting from millimetres to Metre is useful skill in Science. If you want to change millimetre to Metre you divide by 1000 (follow the arrow from mm to m) or if you want to change kilometre to millimetre you multiply by 10001000. 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.8.1|Two other useful conversions|19
Very often in Science you need to convert Speed and Temperature The following two rules will help you do this: Converting Speed When converting kmh1 to ms1you divide by 36. For example 72 kmh1 36 20 ms1. When converting ms1to kmh1 you multiply by 36. For example 30 ms136 108 kmh1. Converting Temperature Converting between the kelvin and celsius Temperature scales is easy. To convert from celsius to kelvin add 273. To convert from kelvin to celsius subtract 273. Representing the kelvin Temperature by TK and the celsius Temperature by ToC 
---------------------------------------------------------

2.9|A sanity test|19
sanity test is method of checking whether an answer makes sense. All we have to do is to take careful look at our answer and ask the question Does the answer make sense? Imagine you were calculating the number of people in classroom. If the answer you got was 000 000 people you would know it was wrong it is not possible to have that many people in classroom. That is all sanity test is is your answer insane or not? It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example let us consider Mass An average person has Mass around 70 Kilogram while the heaviest person in medical history had Mass of 635 Kilogram If you ever have to calculate persons Mass and you get 000 Kilogram this should fail your sanity check your answer is insane and you must have made mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.01 Kilogram should fail your sanity test. The only problem with sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are. For example finding the number of learners in classroom you need to know that there are usually 2050 people in classroom. If you get and answer of 2500 you should realise that it is wrong. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3|Motion in One Dimension|23

---------------------------------------------------------

3.1|Introduction|23
This chapter is about how things move in straight line or more scientifically how things move in one dimension. This is useful for learning how to describe the movement of cars along straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks. If you want to understand how any object moves for example car on the freeway soccer ball being kicked towards the goal or your dog chasing the neighbours cat then you have to understand three basic ideas about what it means when something is moving. These three ideas describe different parts of exactly how an object moves. They are: 1. Position (vector) or Displacement (vector) which tells us exactly where the object is 2. Speed or Velocity which tells us exactly how fast the objects Position (vector) is changing or more familiarly how fast the object is moving and 3. acceleration which tells us exactly how fast the objects Velocity is changing. You will also learn how to use Position (vector) Displacement (vector) Speed Velocity and acceleration to describe the Motion of simple objects. You will learn how to read and draw graphs that summarise the Motion of moving object. You will also learn about the equations that can be used to describe Motion and how to apply these equations to objects moving in one dimension. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.2|Reference Point, Frame of Reference and Position|23
The most important idea when studying Motion is you have to know where you are. The word Position (vector) describes your location (where you are). However saying that you are here is meaningless and you have to specify your Position (vector) relative to known reference point. For example if you are from the doorway inside your classroom then your reference point is the doorway. This defines your Position (vector) inside the classroom. Notice that you need reference point (the doorway) and Direction (geometry) (inside) to define your location. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1|Frames of Reference|23
Definition: Frame of reference Frame of reference is reference point combined with set of Direction (geometry) Frame of reference is similar to the idea of reference point. Frame of reference is defined as reference point combined with set of Direction (geometry) For example boy is standing still inside train as it pulls out of station. You are standing on the platform watching the train move from left to right. To you it looks as if the boy is moving from left to right because relative to where you are standing (the platform) he is moving. According to the boy and his Frame of reference (the train) he is not moving. Frame of reference must have an origin (where you are standing on the platform) and at least Position (vector) Direction (geometry) The train was moving from left to right making to your right Position (vector) and to your left negative. If someone else was looking at the same boy his Frame of reference will be different. For example if he was standing on the other side of the platform the boy will be moving from right to left. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.2.2|Position|25
Definition: Position (vector) Position (vector) is measurement of location with reference to an origin. Position (vector) is measurement of location with reference to an origin. Position (vector) can therefore be negative or Position (vector) The symbol is used to indicate Position (vector) has units of Length for example cm or km. Figure 3.2.2 shows the Position (vector) of school. Depending on what reference point we choose we can say that the school is 300 from Joans house (with Joans house as the reference point or origin) or 500 from Joels house (with Joels house as the reference point or origin). The shop is also 300 from Joans house but in the opposite Direction (geometry) as the school. When we choose reference point we have Position (vector) Direction (geometry) and negative Direction (geometry) If we choose the Direction (geometry) towards the school as Position (vector) then the Direction (geometry) towards the shop is negative. negative Direction (geometry) is always opposite to the Direction (geometry) chosen as Position (vector) 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.3|Displacement and Distance|28
Definition: Displacement (vector) Displacement (vector) is the change in an objects Position (vector) The Displacement (vector) of an object is defined as its change in Position (vector) (final Position (vector) minus initial Position (vector) Displacement (vector) has magnitude and Direction (geometry) and is therefore Euclidean vector For example if the initial Position (vector) of car is xi and it moves to final Position (vector) of xf then the Displacement (vector) is: However subtracting an initial quantity from final quantity happens often in Physics so we use the shortcut to mean final initial. Therefore Displacement (vector) can be written: Important: The words initial and final will be used very often in Physics Initial will always refer to something that happened earlier in time and final will always refer to something that happened later in time. It will often happen that the final value is smaller than the initial value such that the difference is negative. This is ok Displacement (vector) does not depend on the path travelled but only on the initial and final Position (vector) (Figure 3.4). We use the word Distance to describe how far an object travels along particular path. Distance is the actual Distance that was covered. Distance (symbol d) does not have Direction (geometry) so it is Scalar (mathematics) Displacement (vector) is the shortest Distance from the starting point to the endpoint from the school to the shop in the figure. Displacement (vector) has Direction (geometry) and is therefore Euclidean vector Figure 3.2.2 shows the five houses we discussed earlier. Jack walks to school but instead of walking straight to school he decided to walk to his friend Joels house first to fetch him so that they can walk to school together. Jack covers Distance of 400 to Joels house and another 500 to school. He covers Distance of 900 m. His Displacement (vector) however is only 100 towards the school. This is because Displacement (vector) only looks at the starting Position (vector) (his house) and the end Position (vector) (the school). It does not depend on the path he travelled. To calculate his Distance and Displacement (vector) we need to choose reference point and Direction (geometry) Lets choose Jacks house as the reference point and towards Joels house as the Position (vector) direc- tion (which means that towards the school is negative). We would do the calculations as follows: It is possible to have Displacement (vector) of and Distance that is not m. This happens when an object completes round trip back to its original Position (vector) like an athlete running around track. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.3.1|Interpreting Direction|29
Very often in calculations you will get negative answer. For example Jacks Displacement (vector) in the example above is calculated as -100 m. The minus sign in front of the answer means that his Displacement (vector) is 100 in the opposite Direction (geometry) (opposite to the Direction (geometry) chosen as Position (vector) in the beginning of the question). When we start calculation we choose Frame of reference and Position (vector) Direction (geometry) In the first example above the reference point is Jacks house and the Position (vector) Direction (geometry) is towards Joels house. Therefore Jacks Displacement (vector) is 100 towards the school. Notice that Distance has no Direction (geometry) but Displacement (vector) has. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.3.2|Differences between Distance and Displacement|29
Definition: Euclidean vector and Scalar (mathematics) Euclidean vector is Physical quantity with magnitude (size) and Direction (geometry) Scalar (mathematics) is Physical quantity with magnitude (size) only. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.4|Speed, Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity|31
Definition: Velocity Velocity is the rate of change of Position (vector) Definition: Instantaneous Velocity Instantaneous Velocity is the Velocity of an accelerating body at specific instant in time. Definition: Average Velocity Average Velocity is the total Displacement (vector) of body over time interval. Velocity is the rate of change of Position (vector) It tells us how much an objects Position (vector) changes in time. This is the same as the Displacement (vector) divided by the time taken. Since Displacement (vector) is Euclidean vector and time taken is Scalar (mathematics) Velocity is also Euclidean vector We use the symbol for Velocity If we have Displacement (vector) of and time taken of is then defined as: Velocity can be Position (vector) or negative. Position (vector) values of Velocity mean that the object is moving away from the reference point or origin and negative values mean that the object is moving towards the reference point or origin. Important: An instant in time is different from the time taken or the time interval. It is therefore useful to use the symbol for an instant in time (for example during the 4th second) and the symbol for the time taken (for example during the first seconds of the Motion Average Velocity (symbol v) is the Displacement (vector) for the whole Motion divided by the time taken for the whole Motion Instantaneous Velocity is the Velocity at specific instant in time. (Average) Speed (symbol s) is the Distance travelled (d) divided by the time taken (t) for the journey. Distance and time are Scalar (mathematics) and therefore Speed will also be Scalar (mathematics) Speed is calculated as follows: Instantaneous Speed is the magnitude of instantaneous Velocity It has the same value but no Direction (geometry) 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.4.1|Differences between Speed and Velocity|35
The differences between Speed and Velocity can be summarised as: Speed 1. depends on the path taken 2. always Position (vector) 3. is Scalar (mathematics) 4. no dependence on Direction (geometry) and so is only Position (vector) Velocity 1. independent of path taken 2. can be Position (vector) or negative 3. is Euclidean vector 4. Direction (geometry) can be guessed from the sign (i.e. Position (vector) or negative) Additionally an object that makes round trip i.e. travels away from its starting point and then returns to the same point has zero Velocity but travels non-zero Speed 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.5|Acceleration|38
Definition: Acceleration Acceleration is the rate of change of Velocity Acceleration (symbol a) is the rate of change of Velocity It is measure of how fast the Velocity of an object changes in time. If we have change in Velocity (v) over time interval (t) then the acceleration (a) is defined as: Since Velocity is Euclidean vector acceleration is also Euclidean vector Acceleration does not provide any infor- mation about Motion but only about how the Motion changes. It is not possible to tell how fast an object is moving or in which Direction (geometry) from the acceleration. Like Velocity acceleration can be negative or Position (vector) We see that when the sign of the Acceleration ation and the Velocity are the same the object is Speed up. If both Velocity and acceleration are Position (vector) the object is Speed up in Position (vector) Direction (geometry) If both Velocity and acceleration are negative the object is Speed up in negative Direction (geometry) If Velocity is Position (vector) and Acceleration eration is negative then the object is slowing down. Similarly if the Velocity is negative and the acceleration is Position (vector) the object is slowing down. This is illustrated in the following Work (physics) example. Important: Acceleration does not tell us about the Direction (geometry) of the Motion Acceleration only tells us how the Velocity changes. Important: Deceleration Avoid the use of the word deceleration to refer to negative acceleration. This word usually means slowing down and it is possible for an object to slow down with both Position (vector) and negative acceleration because the sign of the Velocity of the object must also be taken into account to determine whether the body is slowing down or not. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.6|Description of Motion|39
The purpose of this chapter is to describe Motion and now that we understand the definitions of Displacement (vector) Distance Velocity Speed and acceleration we are ready to start using these ideas to describe how an object is moving. There are many ways of describing Motion 1. words 2. diagrams 3. graphs These methods will be described in this section. We will consider three types of Motion when the object is not moving (stationary object) when the object is moving at constant Velocity (uniform Motion and when the object is moving at constant acceleration Motion at constant acceleration). 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.6.1|Stationary Object|40
The simplest Motion that we can come across is that of stationary object. stationary object does not move and so its Position (vector) does not change for as long as it is standing still. An example of this situation is when someone is waiting for something without moving. The person remains in the same Position (vector) Lesedi is waiting for taxi. He is standing two Metre from stop street at s. After one minute at 60 he is still Metre from the stop street and after two minutes at 120 also Metre from the stop street. His Position (vector) has not changed. His Displacement (vector) is zero (because his Position (vector) is the same) his Velocity is zero (because his Displacement (vector) is zero) and his acceleration is also zero (because his Velocity is not changing). We can now draw graphs of Position (vector) vs.time (x vs. t) Velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration vs.time (a vs. t) for stationary object. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.5. Lesedis Position (vector) is Metre from the stop street. If the stop street is taken as the reference point his Position (vector) remains at Metre for 120 seconds. The graph is horisontal line at m. The Velocity and acceleration graphs are also shown. They are both horisontal lines on the x-axis. Since his Position (vector) is not changing his Velocity is ms1and since Velocity is not changing acceleration is ms2. Definition: Gradient The gradient of line can be calculated by dividing the change in the y-value by the change in the x-value. Since we know that Velocity is the rate of change of Position (vector) we can confirm the value for the Velocity vs. time graph by calculating the gradient of the vs. graph. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.6.2|Motion at Constant Velocity|41
Motion at constant Velocity or uniform Motion means that the Position (vector) of the object is changing at the same rate. Assume that Lesedi takes 100 to walk the 100 to the taxi-stop every morning. If we assume that Lesedis house is the origin then Lesedis Velocity is: Lesedis Velocity is ms1. This means that he walked in the first second another Metre in the second second and another in the third second and so on. For example after 50 he will be 50 from home. His Position (vector) increases by every s. diagram of Lesedis Position (vector) is shown in Figure 3.6. We can now draw graphs of Position (vector) vs.time (x vs. t) Velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration vs.time (a vs. t) for Lesedi moving at constant Velocity The graphs are shown in Figure 3.7. In the evening Lesedi walks 100 from the bus stop to his house in 100 s. Assume that Lesedis house is the origin. The following graphs can be drawn to describe the Motion We see that the vs. graph is horisontal line. If the Velocity vs. time graph is horisontal line it means that the Velocity is constant (not changing). Motion at constant Velocity is known as uniform Motion We can use the vs. to calculate the Velocity by finding the gradient of the line. Lesedi has Velocity of -1 ms1 or ms1towards his house. You will notice that the vs. graph is horisontal line corresponding to Velocity of -1 ms1. The horisontal line means that the Velocity stays the same (remains constant) during the Motion This is uniform Velocity 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.6.3|Motion at Constant Acceleration|46
The final situation we will be studying is Motion at constant acceleration. We know that acceleration is the rate of change of Velocity So if we have constant acceleration this means that the Velocity changes at constant rate. Lets look at our first example of Lesedi waiting at the taxi stop again. taxi arrived and Lesedi got in. The taxi stopped at the stop street and then accelerated as follows: After the taxi covered Distance of 25 after it covered 10 after seconds it covered 225 and after it covered 40 m. The taxi is covering larger Distance every second. This means that it is accelerating. The acceleration does not change during the Motion (the gradient stays constant). This is Motion at constant or uniform acceleration. The graphs for this situation are shown in Figure 3.9. Velocity from Acceleration vs. Time Graphs Just as we used Velocity vs. time graphs to find Displacement (vector) we can use acceleration vs. time graphs to find the Velocity of an object at given moment in time. We simply calculate the area under the acceleration vs. time graph at given time. In the graph below showing an object at constant Position (vector) acceleration the increase in Velocity of the object after seconds corresponds to the shaded portion. The Velocity of the object at is therefore 10 ms1. This corresponds with the values obtained in Figure 3.9. Important: Often you will be required to describe the Motion of an object that is presented as graph of either Position (vector) Velocity or acceleration as functions of time. The description of the Motion represented by graph should include the following (where possible): 1. whether the object is moving in the Position (vector) or negative Direction (geometry) 2. whether the object is at rest moving at constant Velocity or moving at constant Position (vector) acceleration Speed up) or constant negative acceleration (slowing down) You will also often be required to draw graphs based on description of the Motion in words or from diagram. Remember that these are just different methods of presenting the same information. If you keep in mind the general shapes of the graphs for the different types of Motion there should not be any difficulty with explaining what is happening. 
---------------------------------------------------------

3.8|Worked Examples|49

---------------------------------------------------------

3.9|Equations of Motion|54
In this chapter we will look at the third way to describe Motion We have looked at describing Motion in terms of graphs and words. In this section we examine equations that can be used to describe Motion This section is about solving problems relating to uniformly accelerated Motion In other words Motion at constant acceleration. The questions can vary lot but the following method for answering them will always Work (physics) Use this when attempting question that involves Motion with constant acceleration. You need any three known quantities (vi vf or a) to be able to calculate the fourth one. 1. Read the question carefully to identify the quantities that are given. Write them down. 2. Identify the equation to use. Write it down 3. Ensure that all the values are in the correct unit and fill them in your equation. 4. Calculate the answer and fill in its unit. Galileo Galilei of Pisa Italy was the first to determined the correct mathematical law for acceleration: the total Distance covered starting from rest is proportional to the square of the time. He also concluded that objects retain their Velocity unless Force often Friction acts upon them refuting the accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that objects naturally slow down and stop unless Force acts upon them. This principle was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (1st law).

Weight is the gravitational Force that the Earth exerts on any object. The weight of an objects gives you an indication of how strongly the Earth attracts that body towards its centre. Weight is calculated as follows: Weight mg where Mass of the object (in Kilogram and the acceleration due to Gravity (98 ms2) Important: Weight is sometimes abbreviated as Fg which refers to the Force of Gravity Do not use the abbreviation for weight as it refers to Work (physics) Now we have said that the value of is approximately 98 ms2on the surface of the Earth. The actual value varies slightly over the surface of the Earth. Each Planet in our Solar System has its own value for g. These values are listed as multiples of on Earth in Table 4.1 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.1.1|Differences between Mass and Weight|68
Mass is measured in Kilogram Kilogram and is the amount of matter in an object. An objects Mass does not change unless matter is added or removed from the object. The differences between Mass and weight can be summarised in the following table: Mass 1. is measure of how many molecules there are in an object. 2. is measured in Kilogram 3. is the same on any Planet 4. is Scalar (mathematics) Weight 1. is the Force with which the Earth attracts an object. 2. is measured in newtons 3. is different on different Planet 4. is Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.2|Acceleration due to Gravity|69

---------------------------------------------------------

4.2.1|Gravitational Fields|69
Field (physics) is region of space in which Mass experiences Force Therefore Gravitational field is region of space in which Mass experiences gravitational Force 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.2.2|Free fall|69
Important: Free fall is Motion in the Earths Gravitational field when no other Force act on the object. Free fall is the term used to describe special kind of Motion in the Earths Gravitational field Free fall is Motion in the Earths Gravitational field when no other Force act on the object. It is basically an ideal situation since in reality there is always some air Friction which slows down the Motion If metal ball and tennis ball (of the same size) were dropped from the same height both would reach the ground at the same time. It does not matter that the one ball is heavier than the other. The acceleration of an object due to Gravity is independent of the Mass of the object. It does not matter what the Mass of the object is. The shape of the object however is important. The sheet of paper took much longer to reach the ground than the tennis ball. This is because the effect of air Friction on the paper was much greater than the air Friction on the tennis ball. If we lived in world where there was no air Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance the A4 sheet of paper and the tennis ball would reach the ground at the same time. This happens in outer space or in vaccuum. Galileo Galilei an Italian scientist studied the Motion of objects. The following case study will tell you more about one of his investigations. 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.3|Potential Energy|73
The Potential energy of an object is generally defined as the Energy an object has because of its Position (vector) relative to other objects that it interacts with. There are different kinds of Potential energy such as gravitional Potential energy chemical Potential energy Electric potential energy to name few. In this section we will be looking at gravitational Potential energy Definition: Potential energy Potential energy is the Energy an object has due to its Position (vector) or state. Gravitational Potential energy is the Energy of an object due to its Position (vector) above the surface of the Earth. The symbol PE is used to refer to gravitational Potential energy You will often find that the words Potential energy are used where gravitational Potential energy is meant. We can define Potential energy (or gravitational Potential energy if you like) as: PE mgh (4.5) where PE Potential energy measured in Joule (J) Mass of the object (measured in Kilogram gravitational acceleration (98 ms2) perpendicular height from the reference point (measured in m) suitcase with Mass of Kilogram is placed at the top of high cupboard. By lifting the suitcase against the Force of Gravity we give the suitcase Potential energy This Potential energy can be calculated using equation 4.5. If the suitcase falls off the cupboard it will lose its Potential energy Halfway down the cupboard the suitcase will have lost half its Potential energy and will have only 98 left. At the bottom of the cupboard the suitcase will have lost all its Potential energy and its Potential energy will be equal to zero. Objects have maximum Potential energy at maximum height and will lose their Potential energy as they fall. 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.4|Kinetic Energy|75
Definition: Kinetic Energy Kinetic Energy is the Energy an object has due to its Motion Kinetic Energy is the Energy an object has because of its Motion This means that any moving object has kinetic Energy The faster it moves the more kinetic Energy it has. Kinetic Energy Kinetic energy is therefore dependent on the Velocity of the object. The Mass of the object also plays role. truck of 2000 Kilogram moving at 100 kmhr1 will have more kinetic Energy than car of 500 Kilogram also moving at 100 kmhr1. Kinetic Energy is defined as: Consider the Kilogram suitcase on the cupboard that was discussed earlier. When the suitcase falls it will gain Velocity (fall faster) until it reaches the ground with maximum Velocity The suitcase will not have any kinetic Energy when it is on top of the cupboard because it is not moving. Once it starts to fall it will gain kinetic Energy because it gains Velocity Its kinetic Energy will increase until it is maximum when the suitcase reaches the ground. 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.4.1|Checking units|77
According to the equation for kinetic Energy the unit should be kgm2 s2. We can prove that this unit is equal to the Joule the unit for Energy 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.5|Mechanical Energy|78
Important: Mechanical energy is the sum of the gravitational Potential energy and the kinetic Energy Mechanical energy is simply the sum of gravitational Potential energy (PE) and the kinetic Energy Kinetic energy Mechanical energy is defined as: 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.5.1|Conservation of Mechanical Energy|78
The Law of Conservation of Energy level Energy cannot be created or destroyed but is merely changed from one form into another. Definition: Conservation of Energy The Law of Conservation of Energy Energy cannot be created or destroyed but is merely changed from one form into another. So far we have looked at two types of Energy gravitational Potential energy and kinetic Energy The sum of the gravitational Potential energy and kinetic Energy is called the Mechanical energy In closed system one where there are no external Force acting the Mechanical energy will remain constant. In other words it will not change (become more or less). This is called the Law of Conservation of Mechanical energy and it states: The total amount of Mechanical energy in closed system remains constant. Definition: Conservation of Mechanical energy Law of Conservation of Mechanical energy The total amount of Mechanical energy in closed system remains constant. This means that Potential energy can become kinetic Energy or vise versa but Energy cannot dissappear. The Mechanical energy of an object moving in the Earths Gravitational field (or accelerating as result of Gravity is constant or conserved unless external Force like air Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance acts on the object. We can now use the conservation of Mechanical energy to calculate the Velocity of body in Free fall and show that the Velocity is independent of Mass Important: In problems involving the use of conservation of Energy the path taken by the object can be ignored. The only important quantities are the objects Velocity (which gives its kinetic Energy and height above the reference point (which gives its gravitational Potential energy Important: In the absence of Friction Mechanical energy is conserved and Ubefore Uafter In the presence of Friction Mechanical energy is not conserved. The Mechanical energy lost is equal to the Work (physics) done against Friction Ubefore Uafter Work (physics) done against Friction In general Mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of external Force Examples of external Force are: applied Force Friction Force air Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Tension (physics) normal Force In the presence of internal Force like the Force due to Gravity or the Force in spring Mechanical energy is conserved. 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.5.2|Using the Law of Conservation of Energy|79
Mechanical energy is conserved (in the absence of Friction Therefore we can say that the sum of the PE and the Kinetic energy anywhere during the Motion must be equal to the sum of the PE and the Kinetic energy anywhere else in the Motion We can now apply this to the example of the suitcase on the cupboard. Consider the Mechanical energy of the suitcase at the top and at the bottom. We can say: The suitcase will strike the ground with Velocity of 626 ms1. From this we see that when an object is lifted like the suitcase in our example it gains Potential energy As it falls back to the ground it will lose this Potential energy but gain kinetic en- ergy. We know that Energy cannot be created or destroyed but only changed from one form into another. In our example the Potential energy that the suitcase loses is changed to kinetic Energy The suitcase will have maximum Potential energy at the top of the cupboard and maximum kinetic Energy at the bottom of the cupboard. Halfway down it will have half kinetic Energy and half Potential energy As it moves down the Potential energy will be converted (changed) into kinetic Energy until all the Potential energy is gone and only kinetic Energy is left. The 196 of Potential energy at the top will become 196 of kinetic Energy at the bottom. 
---------------------------------------------------------

4.6|Energy graphs|82
Let us consider our example of the suitcase on the cupboard once more. Lets look at each of these quantities and draw graph for each. We will look at how each quantity changes as the suitcase falls from the top to the bottom of the cupboard. Potential energy The Potential energy starts off at maximum and decreases until it reaches zero at the bottom of the cupboard. It had fallen Distance of Metre Kinetic Energy The kinetic Energy is zero at the start of the fall. When the suitcase reaches the ground the kinetic Energy is miximum. We also use Distance on the x-axis. Mechanical energy The Mechanical energy is constant throughout the Motion and is always maximum. At any point in time when we add the Potential energy and the kinetic Energy we will get the same number. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5|Transverse Pulses|87

---------------------------------------------------------

5.1|Introduction|87
This chapter forms the basis of the discussion into mechanical Wave Wave are all around us even though most of us are not aware of it. The most common Wave are Wave in the sea but Wave can be created in any container of water ranging from an ocean to tea-cup. Simply Wave is moving Energy 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.2|What is a medium?|87
In this chapter as well as in the following chapters we will speak about Wave moving in medium. medium is just the substance or material through which Wave move. In other words the medium carries the Wave from one place to another. The medium does not create the Wave and the medium is not the Wave Air is medium for Sound Wave water is medium for water Wave and rock is medium for earthquakes (which are also type of Wave Air water and rock are therefore examples of media (media is the plural of medium). Definition: Medium medium is the substance or material in which Wave will move. In each medium the atoms that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest Position (vector) In order for Wave to travel the different parts of the medium must be able to interact with each other. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.3|What is a pulse?|87
In the activity we created pulse. pulse is single disturbance that moves through medium. transverse pulse moves perpendicular to the medium. Figure 5.1 shows an example of transverse pulse. In the activity the rope or spring was held horizontally and the pulse moved the rope up and down. This was an example of transverse pulse. Definition: Pulse pulse is single disturbance that moves through medium. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.3.1|Pulse Length and Amplitude|88
The Amplitude of pulse is measurement of how far the medium is Displacement (vector) from Position (vector) of rest. The pulse Length is measurement of how long the pulse is. Both these quantities are shown in Figure 5.1. Definition: Amplitude The Amplitude of pulse is measurement of how far the medium is Displacement (vector) from rest. In the activity we found that the values for how high the pulse (a) is and how wide the pulse (p) is the same at different times. Pulse Length and Amplitude are two important quantities of pulse. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.3.2|Pulse Speed|89
Definition: Pulse Speed Pulse Speed is the Distance pulse travels in specific time. In Chapter we saw that Speed was defined as the Distance travelled in specified time. We can use the same definition of Speed to calculate how fast pulse travels. If the pulse travels Distance in time then the pulse Speed is: Important: The pulse Speed depends on the properties of the medium and not on the Amplitude or pulse Length of the pulse. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.4|Graphs of Position and Velocity|90
When pulse moves through medium there are two different Motion the Motion of the particles of the medium and the Motion of the pulse. These two Motion are at right angles to each other when the pulse is transverse. Each Motion will be discussed. Consider the situation shown in Figure ??. The dot represents one particle of the medium. We see that as the pulse moves to the right the particle only moves up and down. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.4.1|Motion of a Particle of the Medium|90
First we consider the Motion of particle of the medium when pulse moves through the medium. For the explanation we will zoom into the medium so that we are looking at the atoms of the medium. These atoms are connected to each other as shown in Figure 5.2. When pulse moves through the medium the particles in the medium only move up and down. We can see this in the figure below which shows the Motion of single particle as pulse moves through the medium. Important: particle in the medium only moves up and down when transverse pulse moves through the medium. The pulse moves from left to right (or right to left). The Motion of the particle is perpendicular to the Motion of transverse pulse. If you consider the Motion of the particle as function of time you can draw graph of Position (vector) vs. time and Velocity vs. time. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.4.2|Motion of the Pulse|92
The Motion of the pulse is much simpler than the Motion of particle in the medium. Important: point on transverse pulse eg. the peak only moves in the Direction (geometry) of the Motion of the pulse. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.5|Transmission and Reflection of a Pulse at a Boundary|96
What happens when pulse travelling in one medium finds that medium is joined to another? When pulse meets boundary between two media part of the pulse is Reflection (physics) and part of it is transmitted. You will see that in the thin rope the pulse moves back (is Reflection (physics) The pulse is also passed on (transmitted) to the thick rope and it moves away from the boundary. When pulse is transmitted from one medium to another like from thin rope to thicker one the pulse will change where it meets the boundary of the two mediums (for example where the ropes are joined). When pulse moves from thin rope to thicker one the Speed of the pulse will decrease. The pulse will move slower and the pulse Length will increase. When pulse moves from thick rope to thinner one the opposite happens. The pulse Speed will increase and the pulse Length will decrease. When the Speed of the pulse increases the pulse Length will decrease. If the Speed decreases the pulse Length will increase. The incident pulse is the one that arrives at the boundary. The Reflection (physics) pulse is the one that moves back away from the boundary. The transmitted pulse is the one that moves into the new medium away from the boundary. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.6|Reflection of a Pulse from Fixed and Free Ends|97
Let us now consider what happens to pulse when it reaches the end of medium. The medium can be fixed like rope tied to wall or it can be free like rope tied loosely to pole. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.6.1|Reflection of a Pulse from a Fixed End|97
When the end of the medium is fixed for example rope tied to wall pulse Reflection (physics) from the fixed end but the pulse is inverted (i.e. it is upside-down). This is shown in Figure 5.9. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.6.2|Reflection of a Pulse from a Free End|98
When the end of the medium is free for example rope tied loosely to pole pulse Reflection (physics) from the free end but the pulse is not inverted. This is shown in Figure 5.10. We draw the free end as ring around the pole. The ring will move up and down the pole while the pulse is Reflection (physics) away from the pole. Important: The fixed and free ends that were discussed in this section are examples of boundary conditions. You will see more of boundary conditions as you progress in the Physics syllabus. 
---------------------------------------------------------

5.7|Superposition of Pulses|99
Two or more pulses can pass through the same medium at that same time. The resulting pulse is obtained by using the principle of superposition. The principle of superposition states that the effect of the pulses is the sum of their individual effects. After pulses pass through each other each pulse continues along its original Direction (geometry) of travel and their original Amplitude remain unchanged. Constructive interference takes place when two pulses meet each other to create larger pulse. The Amplitude of the resulting pulse is the sum of the Amplitude of the two initial pulses. This is shown in Figure 5.11. Definition: Constructive interference is when two pulses meet resulting in bigger pulse. Destructive interference takes place when two pulses meet and cancel each other. The Amplitude of the resulting pulse is the sum of the Amplitude of the two initial pulses but the one Amplitude will be negative number. This is shown in Figure 5.12. In general Amplitude of individual pulses add together to give the Amplitude of the resultant pulse. Definition: Destructive interference is when two pulses meet resulting in smaller pulse. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6|Transverse Waves|105

---------------------------------------------------------

6.1|Introduction|105
Wave occur frequently in nature. The most obvious examples are Wave in water on dam in the ocean or in bucket. We are most interested in the properties that Wave have. All Wave have the same properties so if we study Wave in water then we can transfer our knowledge to predict how other examples of Wave will behave. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.2|What is a transverse wave?|105
We have studied pulses in Chapter and know that pulse is single disturbance that travels through medium. Wave is periodic continuous disturbance that consists of train of pulses. Definition: Wave Wave is periodic continuous disturbance that consists of train of pulses. Definition: Transverse Wave transverse Wave is Wave where the movement of the particles of the medium is perpen- dicular to the Direction (geometry) of propagation of the Wave In the Activity you have created Wave The medium through which these Wave propagated was the rope which is obviously made up of very large number of particles (atoms). From the activity you would have noticed that the Wave travelled from left to right but the particles (the ribbon) moved only up and down. When the particles of medium move at right angles to the Direction (geometry) of propagation of Wave the Wave is called transverse. For Wave there is no net Displacement (vector) of the particles (they return to their equilibrium Position (vector) but there is net Displacement (vector) of the Wave There are thus two different Motion the Motion of the particles of the medium and the Motion of the Wave 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.2.1|Peaks and Troughs|106
Wave consist of moving peaks (or Crest (physics) and Crest (physics) peak is the highest point the medium rises to and Crest (physics) is the lowest point the medium sinks to. Peaks and Crest (physics) on transverse Wave are shown in Figure 6.2. Definition: Peaks and Crest (physics) peak is point on the Wave where the Displacement (vector) of the medium is at maximum. point on the Wave is Crest (physics) if the Displacement (vector) of the medium at that point is at minimum. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.2.2|Amplitude and Wavelength|107
There are few properties that we saw with pulses that also apply to Wave These are Amplitude and Wavelength (we called this pulse Length Definition: Amplitude The Amplitude is the maximum Displacement (vector) of particle from its equilibrium Position (vector) As we have seen in the activity on Amplitude the Distance between the peak and the equilibrium Position (vector) is equal to the Distance between the Crest (physics) and the equilibrium Position (vector) This Distance is known as the Amplitude of the Wave and is the characteristic height of Wave above or below the equilibrium Position (vector) Normally the symbol is used to represent the Amplitude of Wave The SI unit of Amplitude is the Metre (m). As we have seen in the activity on Wavelength the Distance between two adjacent peaks is the same no matter which two adjacent peaks you choose. There is fixed Distance between the peaks. Similarly we have seen that there is fixed Distance between the Crest (physics) no matter which two Crest (physics) you look at. More importantly the Distance between two adjacent peaks is the same as the Distance between two adjacent Crest (physics) This Distance is call the Wavelength of the Wave The symbol for the Wavelength is (the Greek letter lambda) and Wavelength is measured in Metre (m). 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.2.3|Points in Phase|109
In the activity the Distance between the indicated points was the same. These points are then said to be in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an integer (0123...) number of complete Wave cycles. They do not have to be peaks or Crest (physics) but they must be separated by complete number of Wavelength We then have an alternate definition of the Wavelength as the Distance between any two adjacent points which are in phase. Definition: Wavelength of Wave The Wavelength of Wave is the Distance between any two adjacent points that are in phase. Points that are not in phase those that are not separated by complete number of Wavelength are called out of phase. Examples of points like these would be and or and or and in the Activity. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.2.4|Period and Frequency|110
Imagine you are sitting next to pond and you watch the Wave going past you. First one peak arrives then Crest (physics) and then another peak. Suppose you measure the time taken between one peak arriving and then the next. This time will be the same for any two successive peaks passing you. We call this time the period and it is characteristic of the Wave The symbol is used to represent the period. The period is measured in seconds (s). Definition: The period (T) is the time taken for two successive peaks (or Crest (physics) to pass fixed point. Imagine the pond again. Just as peak passes you you start your stopwatch and count each peak going past. After second you stop the clock and stop counting. The number of peaks that you have counted in the second is the Frequency of the Wave Definition: The Frequency is the number of successive peaks (or Crest (physics) passing given point in second. The Frequency and the period are related to each other. As the period is the time taken for peak to pass then the number of peaks passing the point in second is But this is the Frequency So 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.2.5|Speed of a Transverse Wave|111
In Chapter we saw that Speed was defined as Speed Distance travelled time taken The Distance between two successive peaks is Wavelength Thus in time of period the Wave will travel Wavelength in Distance Thus the Speed of the Wave is: Distance travelled time taken However Therefore we can also write: We call this equation the Wave equation. To summarise we have that where 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.3|Graphs of Particle Motion|115
In Chapter we saw that when pulse moves through medium there are two different Motion the Motion of the particles of the medium and the Motion of the pulse. These two Motion are at right angles to each other when the pulse is transverse. Since transverse Wave is series of transverse pulses the particle in the medium and the Wave move in exactly the same way as for the pulse. When transverse Wave moves through the medium the particles in the medium only move up and down. We can see this in the figure below which shows the Motion of single particle as transverse Wave moves through the medium. As in Chapter we can draw graph of the particles Position (vector) as function of time. For the Wave shown in the above figure we can draw the graph shown below. The graph of the particles Velocity as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the Motion graphs and derivatives The graph of Velocity vs. time for the Motion graphs and derivatives above is shown in the graph below. The graph of the particles acceleration as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the Velocity vs. time graph. The graph of acceleration vs. time for the Motion graphs and derivatives shown above is shown below. As for Motion in one dimension these graphs can be used to describe the Motion of the particle. This is illustrated in the Work (physics) examples below. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.4|Standing Waves and Boundary Conditions|118

---------------------------------------------------------

6.4.1|Reflection of a Transverse Wave from a Fixed End|118
We have seen that when pulse meets fixed endpoint the pulse is Reflection (physics) but it is inverted. Since transverse Wave is series of pulses transverse Wave meeting fixed endpoint is also Reflection (physics) and the Reflection (physics) Wave is inverted. That means that the peaks and Crest (physics) are swapped around. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.4.2|Reflection of a Transverse Wave from a Free End|118
If transverse Wave are Reflection (physics) from an end which is free to move the Wave sent down the string are Reflection (physics) but do not suffer phase shift as shown in Figure 6.4. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.4.3|Standing Waves|118
What happens when Reflection (physics) transverse Wave meets an incident transverse Wave When two Wave move in opposite Direction (geometry) through each other interference takes place. If the two Wave have the same Frequency and Wavelength then Standing wave are generated. Standing wave are so-called because they appear to be standing still. We can now look closely how Standing wave are formed. Figure 6.5 shows Reflection (physics) Wave meeting an incident Wave When they touch both Wave have an Amplitude of zero: Figure 6.6: Reflection (physics) Wave (solid line) meets the incident Wave (dashed line). If we wait for short time the ends of the two Wave move past each other and the Wave overlap. To find the resultant Wave we add the two together. Figure 6.7: Reflection (physics) Wave (solid line) overlaps slightly with the incident Wave (dashed line). In this picture we show the two Wave as dotted lines and the sum of the two in the overlap region is shown as solid line: The important thing to note in this case is that there are some points where the two Wave always destructively interfere to zero. If we let the two Wave move little further we get the picture below: Again we have to add the two Wave together in the overlap region to see what the sum of the Wave looks like. In this case the two Wave have moved half cycle past each other but because they are out of phase they cancel out completely. When the Wave have moved past each other so that they are overlapping for large region the situation looks like Wave oscillating in place. The following sequence of diagrams show what the resulting Wave will look like. To make it clearer the arrows at the top of the picture show peaks where maximum Position (vector) constructive interference is taking place. The arrows at the bottom of the picture show places where maximum negative interference is taking place. As time goes by the peaks become smaller and the Crest (physics) become shallower but they do not move. For an instant the entire region will look completely flat. The various points continue their Motion in the same manner. Eventually the picture looks like the complete Reflection (physics) through the x-axis of what we started with: Then all the points begin to move back. Each point on the line is oscillating up and down with different Amplitude If we look at the overall result we get Standing wave Figure 6.8: Standing wave If we superimpose the two cases where the peaks were at maximum and the case where the same Wave were at minimum we can see the lines that the points oscillate between. We call this the envelope of the Standing wave as it contains all the oscillations of the individual points. To make the concept of the envelope clearer let us draw arrows describing the Motion of points along the line. Every point in the medium containing Standing wave oscillates up and down and the Amplitude of the oscillations depends on the location of the point. It is convenient to draw the envelope for the oscillations to describe the Motion We cannot draw the up and down arrows for every single point Interesting Fact Standing wave can be problem in for example indoor concerts where the dimensions of the concert venue coincide with particular Wavelength Standing wave can appear as feedback which would occur if the Standing wave was picked up by the microphones on stage and amplified. 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.4.4|Nodes and anti-nodes|122
node is point on Wave where no Displacement (vector) takes place. In Standing wave node is place where the two Wave cancel out completely as two Wave destructively interfere in the same place. fixed end of rope is node. An anti-node is point on Wave where maximum Displacement (vector) takes place. In Standing wave an anti-node is place where the two Wave constructively interfere. free end of rope is an anti-node. Definition: Node node is point on Wave where no Displacement (vector) takes place. In Standing wave node is place where the two Wave cancel out completely as two Wave destructively interfere in the same place. fixed end of rope is node. Definition: Anti-Node An anti-node is point on Wave where maximum Displacement (vector) takes place. In Standing wave an anti-node is place where the two Wave constructively interfere. free end of rope is an anti-node. Important: The Distance between two anti-nodes is only because it is the Distance from peak to Crest (physics) in one of the Wave forming the Standing wave It is the same as the Distance between two adjacent nodes. This will be important when we Work (physics) out the allowed Wavelength in tubes later. We can take this further because half-way between any two anti-nodes is node. Then the Distance from the node to the anti-node is half the Distance between two anti-nodes. This is half of half Wavelength which is one quarter of Wavelength 
---------------------------------------------------------

6.4.5|Wavelengths of Standing Waves with Fixed and Free Ends|122
There are many applications which make use of the properties of Wave and the use of fixed and free ends. Most musical instruments rely on the basic picture that we have presented to create specific Sound either through standing pressure Wave or standing vibratory Wave in strings. The key is to understand that Standing wave must be created in the medium that is oscillating. There are restrictions as to what Wavelength can form Standing wave in medium. For example if we consider rope that can move in pipe such that it can have both ends free to move (Case 1) one end free and one end fixed (Case 2) both ends fixed (Case 3). Each of these cases is slightly different because the free or fixed end determines whether node or anti-node will form when Standing wave is created in the rope. These are the main restrictions when we determine the Wavelength of potential Standing wave These restrictions are known as boundary conditions and must be met. In the diagram below you can see the three different cases. It is possible to create Standing wave with different Frequency and Wavelength as long as the end criteria are met. The longer the Wavelength the less the number of anti-nodes in the Standing wave We cannot have Standing wave with no anti-nodes because then there would be no oscillations. We use to number the anti-nodes. If all of the tubes have Length and we know the end constraints we can find the Wavelength for specific number of anti-nodes. One Node Lets Work (physics) out the longest Wavelength we can have in each tube i.e. the case for Case 1: In the first tube both ends must be nodes so we can place one anti-node in the middle of the tube. We know the Distance from one node to another is and we also know this Distance is L. So we can equate the two and solve for the Wavelength Case 2: In the second tube one end must be node and the other must be an anti-node. We are looking at the case with one anti-node we are Force to have it at the end. We know the Distance from one node to another is but we only have half this Distance contained in the tube. So Case 3: Here both ends are closed and so we must have two nodes so it is impossible to construct case with only one node. Two Nodes Next we determine which Wavelength could be formed if we had two nodes. Remember that we are dividing the tube up into smaller and smaller segments by having more nodes so we expect the Wavelength to get shorter. 3L 2L Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have two nodes inside the tube only if we have one anti-node contained inside the tube and one on each end. This means we have anti-nodes in the tube. The Distance between any two anti-nodes is half Wavelength This means there is half Wavelength between the left side and the middle and another half Wavelength between the middle and the right side so there must be one Wavelength inside the tube. The safest thing to do is Work (physics) out how many half Wavelength there are and equate this to the Length of the tube and then solve for Case 2: We want to have two nodes inside the tube. The left end must be node and the right end must be an anti-node. We can have one node inside the tube as drawn above. Again we can count the number of Distance between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes. If we start from the left end we have one half Wavelength between the end and the node inside the tube. The Distance from the node inside the tube to the right end which is an anti-node is half of the Distance to another node. So it is half of half Wavelength Together these add up to the Length of the tube: Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. This means that the Length of the tube is one half Wavelength So we can equate the two and solve for the Wavelength 2L Important: If you ever calculate longer Wavelength for more nodes you have made mistake. Remember to check if your answers make sense Three Nodes To see the complete pattern for all cases we need to check what the next step for case is when we have an additional node. Below is the diagram for the case where 3. 3L 5L Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have three nodes inside the tube only if we have two anti-nodes contained inside the tube and one on each end. This means we have anti-nodes in the tube. The Distance between any two anti-nodes is half Wavelength This means there is half Wavelength between every adjacent pair of anti-nodes. We count how many gaps there are between adjacent anti-nodes to determine how many half Wavelength there are and equate this to the Length of the tube and then solve for we can count the number of Distance between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes together these add up to the Length of the tube. Remember that the Distance between the node and an adjacent anti-node is only half the Distance between adjacent nodes. So starting from the left end we count nodes so half Wavelength intervals and then only node to anti-node Distance 2( Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. With one node in between there are two sets of adjacent nodes. This means that the Length of the tube consists of two half Wavelength sections:

6.4.6|Superposition and Interference|125
If two Wave meet interesting things can happen. Wave are basically collective Motion of particles. So when two Wave meet they both try to impose their collective Motion on the particles. This can have quite different results. If two identical (same Wavelength Amplitude and Frequency Wave are both trying to form peak then they are able to achieve the sum of their efforts. The resulting Motion will be peak which has height which is the sum of the heights of the two Wave If two Wave are both trying to form Crest (physics) in the same place then deeper Crest (physics) is formed the depth of which is the sum of the depths of the two Wave Now in this case the two Wave have been trying to do the same thing and so add together constructively. This is called constructive interference. If one Wave is trying to form peak and the other is trying to form Crest (physics) then they are competing to do different things. In this case they can cancel out. The Amplitude of the resulting Wave will depend on the Amplitude of the two Wave that are Interference (wave propagation) If the depth of the Crest (physics) is the same as the height of the peak nothing will happen. If the height of the peak is bigger than the depth of the Crest (physics) smaller peak will appear. And if the Crest (physics) is deeper then less deep Crest (physics) will appear. This is destructive interference.

---------------------------------------------------------

7.1|Introduction|129
You are indoors on sunny day. beam of sunlight through window Light up section of the floor. How would you draw this sunbeam? You might draw series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate no matter how Hardness you look you will not find unique lines of Light in the sunbeam However this is good way to draw Light It is also good way to model Light geometrically as we will see in this chapter. We will call these narrow imaginary lines of Light Light Ray (optics) Since Light is an electromagnetic Wave you could think of Light Ray (optics) as the path of point on the Crest (physics) of Wave Or you could think of Light Ray (optics) as the path taken by miniscule particle that carries Light We will always draw them the same way: as straight lines between objects images and Geometrical optics devices. We can use Light Ray (optics) to model mirrors lenses Telescope Optical microscope and prisms. The study of how Light interacts with materials is Geometrical optics When dealing with Light Ray (optics) we are usually interested in the shape of material and the angles at which Light Ray (optics) hit it. From these angles we can Work (physics) out for example the Distance between an object and its Reflection (physics) We therefore refer to this kind of Geometrical optics as Geometrical optics 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.2|Light Rays|129
In Physics we use the idea of Light Ray (optics) to indicate the Direction (geometry) that Light travels. Light Ray (optics) are lines with arrows and are used to show the path that Light travels. In Figure 7.1 the Light Ray (optics) from the object enters the eye and the eye sees the object. The most important thing to remember is that we can only see an object when Light from the object enters our eyes. The object must be source of Light (for example Light bulb) or else it must Reflection (physics) Light from source (for example the moon) and the Reflection (physics) Light enters our eyes. Important: We cannot see an object unless Light from that object enters our eyes. Definition: Light Ray (optics) Light Ray (optics) are straight lines with arrows to show the path of Light Important: Light Ray (optics) are not real. They are merely used to show the path that Light travels. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.2.1|Shadows|132
Objects cast shadows when Light shines on them. This is more evidence that Light travels in straight lines. The picture below shows how shadows are formed. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.2.2|Ray Diagrams|132
Ray (optics) diagram is drawing that shows the path of Light Ray (optics) Light Ray (optics) are drawn using straight lines and arrow heads. The figure below shows some examples of Ray (optics) diagrams. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.3|Reflection|132
When you smile into mirror you see your own face smiling back at you. This is caused by the Reflection (physics) of Light Ray (optics) on the Mirror image occurs when Light Ray (optics) bounces off surface. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.3.1|Terminology|133
In Chapters and we saw that when pulse or Wave strikes surface it is Reflection (physics) This means that Wave bounce off things. Sound Wave bounce off walls Light Wave bounce off mirrors radar Wave bounce off aeroplanes and it can explain how bats can fly at night and avoid things as thin as telephone wires. The phenomenon of Reflection (physics) is very important and useful one. We will use the following terminology. The incoming Light Ray (optics) is called the incident Ray (optics) The Light Ray (optics) moving away from the surface is the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) The most important characteristic of these Ray (optics) is their angles in relation to the Reflection (physics) surface. These angles are measured with respect to the normal of the surface. The normal is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface. The Angle of incidence is measured between the incident Ray (optics) and the surface normal. The angle of Reflection (physics) is measured between the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) and the surface normal. This is shown in Figure 7.4. When Ray (optics) of Light is Reflection (physics) the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) lies in the same plane as the incident Ray (optics) and the normal. This plane is called the plane of incidence and is shown in Figure 7.5. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.3.2|Law of Reflection|133
Specular reflection states that the Angle of incidence and Reflection (physics) are always equal and that the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) always lies in the plane of incidence. Definition: Specular reflection Specular reflection states that the Angle of incidence is equal to the angle of Reflection (physics) The simplest example of the law of incidence is if the Angle of incidence is 0. In this case the angle of Reflection (physics) is also 0. You see this when you look straight into mirror. Figure 7.6: When Wave strikes surface at right angles to the surface then the Wave is Reflection (physics) directly back. If the Angle of incidence is not then the angle of Reflection (physics) is also not 0. For example if Light strikes surface at 60 to the surface normal then the angle that the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) makes with the surface normal is also 60 as shown in Figure 7.7. Figure 7.7: Ray (optics) diagram showing Angle of incidence and angle of Reflection (physics) Specular reflection states that when Light Ray (optics) Reflection (physics) off surface the angle of Reflection (physics) is the same as the Angle of incidence i. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.3.3|Types of Reflection|135
Specular reflection is true for any surface. Does this mean that when parallel Ray (optics) approach surface the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) will also be parallel? This depends on the texture of the Reflection (physics) surface. Specular reflection Reflection (physics) Figure 7.8(a) shows surface that is flat and even. Parallel incident Light Ray (optics) hit the smooth surface and parallel Reflection (physics) Light Ray (optics) leave the surface. This type of Reflection (physics) is called Specular reflection Reflection (physics) Specular reflection Reflection (physics) occurs when Ray (optics) are Reflection (physics) from smooth shiny surface. The normal to the surface is the same at every point on the surface. Parallel incident Ray (optics) become parallel Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) When you look in mirror the image you see is formed by Specular reflection Reflection (physics) Diffuse Reflection (physics) Figure 7.8(b) shows surface with bumps and curves. When multiple Ray (optics) hit this uneven surface diffuse Reflection (physics) occurs. The incident Ray (optics) are parallel but the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) are not. Each point on the surface has different normal. This means the Angle of incidence is different at each point. Then according to Specular reflection each angle of Reflection (physics) is different. Diffuse Reflection (physics) occurs when Light Ray (optics) are Reflection (physics) from bumpy surfaces. You can still see Reflection (physics) as long as the surface is not too bumpy. Diffuse Reflection (physics) enables us to see all objects that are not sources of Light 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.4|Refraction|137
In the previous sections we studied Light Reflection (physics) off various surfaces. What happens when Light passes through medium? Like all Wave the Speed of Light is dependent on the medium in which it is travelling. When Light moves from one medium into another (for example from air to glass) the Speed of Light changes. The effect is that the Light Ray (optics) passing into new medium is Refraction or bent. Refraction is therefore the bending of Light as it moves from one Geometrical optics medium to another. Definition: Refraction Refraction is the bending of Light that occurs because Light travels at different Speed in different materials. When Light travels from one medium to another it will be bent away from its original path. When it travels from an Geometrical optics dense medium like water or glass to less dense medium like air it will be Refraction away from the normal (Figure 7.9). Whereas if it travels from less dense medium to denser one it will be Refraction towards the normal (Figure 7.10). Just as we defined an angle of Reflection (physics) in the previous section we can similarly define an angle of Refraction as the angle between the surface normal and the Refraction Ray (optics) This is shown in Figure 7.11. Figure 7.9: Light is moving from an Geometrical optics dense medium to an Geometrical optics less dense medium. Light is Refraction away from the normal. Figure 7.10: Light is moving from an Geometrical optics less dense medium to an Geometrical optics denser medium. Light is Refraction towards the normal. Figure 7.11: Light moving from one medium to another bends towards or away from the surface normal. The angle of Refraction is shown. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.4.1|Refractive Index|139
Which is easier to travel through air or water? People usually travel faster through air. So does Light The Speed of Light and therefore the degree of bending of the Light depends on the Refraction index of material through which the Light passes. The Refraction index (symbol n) is the ratio of the Speed of Light in vacuum to its Speed in the material. You can think of the Refraction index as measure of how difficult it is for Light to get through material. Definition: Refraction Index The Refraction index of material is the ratio of the Speed of Light in vacuum to its Speed in the medium. The symbol is used to represent the Speed of Light in vacuum. 299 792 485m s1 For purposes of calculation we use 108m s1. vacuum is region with no matter in it not even air. However the Speed of Light in air is very close to that in vacuum. Definition: Refraction Index The Refraction index (symbol n) of material is the ratio of the Speed of Light in vacuum to its Speed in the material and gives an indication of how difficult it is for Light to get through the material. where Refraction index (no unit) Speed of Light in vacuum (300 108m s1) Speed of Light in given medium (m s1) Extension: Refraction Index and Speed of Light Using we can also examine how the Speed of Light changes in different media because the Speed of Light in vacuum (c) is constant. If the Refraction index increases the Speed of Light in the material must decrease. Light therefore travels slowly through materials of high n. Table 7.4.1 shows Refraction indices for various materials. Light travels slower in any material than it does in vacuum so all values for are greater than 1. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.4.2|Snell's Law|139
Now that we know that the degree of bending or the angle of Refraction is dependent on the Refraction index of medium how do we calculate the angle of Refraction The Angle of incidence and Refraction when Light travels from one medium to another can be calculated using Snell's law Table 7.1: Refraction indices of some materials. nair is calculated at STP and all values are determined for yellow sodium Light which has Wavelength of 5893 nm. Definition: Snell's law n1 sin n2 sin where n1 Refraction index of material n2 Refraction index of material Angle of Angle of incidence of Refraction Remember that Angle of incidence and Refraction are measured from the normal which is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface. Suppose we have two media with Refraction indices n1 and n2. Light Ray (optics) is incident on the surface between these materials with an Angle of incidence 1. The Refraction Ray (optics) that passes through the second medium will have an angle of Refraction 2. If n2 n1 then from Snell's law sin sin 2. For angles smaller than 90 sin increases as increases. Therefore 2. This means that the Angle of incidence is greater than the angle of Refraction and the Light Ray (optics) is bent toward the normal. Similarly if n2 n1 then from Snell's law sin sin 2. For angles smaller than 90 sin increases as increases. Therefore 2. This means that the Angle of incidence is less than the angle of Refraction and the Light Ray (optics) is away toward the normal. Both these situations can be seen in Figure 7.12. Figure 7.12: Refraction of two Light Ray (optics) (a) Ray (optics) travels from medium of low Refraction index to one of high Refraction index. The Ray (optics) is bent towards the normal. (b) Ray (optics) travels from medium with high Refraction index to one with low Refraction index. The Ray (optics) is bent away from the normal. What happens to Ray (optics) that lies along the normal line? In this case the Angle of incidence is and sin n1 n2 sin 0. This shows that if the Light Ray (optics) is incident at then the angle of Refraction is also 0. The Ray (optics) passes through the surface unchanged i.e. no Refraction occurs. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.4.3|Apparent Depth|143
Imagine coin on the bottom of shallow pool of water. If you reach for the coin you will miss it because the Light Ray (optics) from the coin are Refraction at the waters surface. Consider Light Ray (optics) that travels from an underwater object to your eye. The Ray (optics) is Refraction at the water surface and then reaches your eye. Your eye does not know Snell's law it assumes Light Ray (optics) travel in straight lines. Your eye therefore sees the image of the at coin shallower location. This shallower location is known as the apparent depth. The Refraction index of medium can also be expressed as 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5|Mirrors|146
mirror is highly Reflection (physics) surface. The most common mirrors are flat and are known as Plane mirror Household mirrors are Plane mirror They are made of flat piece of glass with thin layer of silver nitrate or aluminium on the back. However other mirrors are curved and are either Curved mirror or are Curved mirror The Reflection (physics) properties of all three types of mirrors will be discussed in this section. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.1|Image Formation|146
Definition: Image An image is representation of an object formed by mirror or lens. Light from the image is seen. If you place candle in front of mirror you now see two candles. The actual Physics candle is called the object and the picture you see in the mirror is called the image. The object is the source of the incident Ray (optics) The image is the picture that is formed by the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) The object could be an actual source that emits Light such as Light bulb or candle. More commonly the object Reflection (physics) Light from another source. When you look at your face in the mirror your face does not emit Light Instead Light from Light bulb or from the sun Reflection (physics) off your face and then hits the mirror. However in Work (physics) with Light Ray (optics) it is easiest to pretend the Light is coming from the object. An image formed by Reflection (physics) may be real or virtual. Real image occurs when Light Ray (optics) actually intersect at the image. Real image is inverted or upside down. Virtual image occurs when Light Ray (optics) do not actually meet at the image. Instead you see the image because your eye projects Light Ray (optics) backward. You are fooled into seeing an image Virtual image is erect or right side up (upright). You can tell the two types apart by putting screen at the location of the image. Real image can be formed on the screen because the Light Ray (optics) actually meet there. Virtual image cannot be seen on screen since it is not really there. To describe objects and images we need to know their locations and their sizes. The Distance from the mirror to the object is the object Distance do. The Distance from the mirror to the image is the image Distance di. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.2|Plane Mirrors|147
When you look into mirror you see an image of yourself. The image created in the mirror has the following properties: 1. The image is virtual. 2. The image is the same Distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. 3. The image is laterally inverted. This means that the image is inverted from side to side. 4. The image is the same size as the object. 5. The image is upright. Virtual image are images formed in places where Light does not really reach. Light does not really pass through the mirror to create the image it only appears to an observer as though the Light were coming from behind the mirror. Whenever mirror creates an image which is virtual the image will always be located behind the mirror where Light does not really pass. Definition: Virtual image Virtual image is upright on the opposite side of the mirror as the object and Light does not actually reach it. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.3|Ray Diagrams|148
We draw Ray (optics) diagrams to predict the image that is formed by Plane mirror Ray (optics) diagram is geometrical picture that is used for analyzing the images formed by mirrors and lenses. We draw few characteristic Ray (optics) from the object to the mirror. We then follow ray-tracing rules to find the path of the Ray (optics) and locate the image. Important: mirror obeys Specular reflection The Ray (optics) diagram for the image formed by Plane mirror is the simplest possible Ray (optics) diagram. Figure 7.15 shows an object placed in front of Plane mirror It is convenient to have central line that runs perpendicular to the mirror. This imaginary line is called the principal axis. Important: Ray (optics) diagrams The following should be remembered when drawing Ray (optics) diagrams: 1. Objects are represented by arrows. The Length of the arrow represents the height of the object. 2. If the arrow points upwards then the object is described as upright or erect. If the arrow points downwards then the object is described as inverted. 3. If the object is real then the arrow is drawn with solid line. If the object is virtual then the arrow is drawn with dashed line. Method: Ray (optics) Diagrams for Plane mirror Ray (optics) diagrams are used to find the Position (vector) and size and whether the image is real or virtual. 1. Draw the Plane mirror as straight line on principal axis. 2. Draw the object as an arrow in front of the mirror. 3. Draw the image of the object by using the principle that the image is placed at the same Distance behind the mirror that the object is in front of the mirror. The image size is also the same as the object size. 4. Place dot at the point the eye is located. 5. Pick one point on the image and draw the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) that travels to the eye as it sees this point. Remember to add an arrowhead. 6. Draw the incident Ray (optics) for Light traveling from the corresponding point on the object to the mirror such that Specular reflection is obeyed. 7. Continue for other extreme points on the object. Suppose Light Ray (optics) leaves the top of the object traveling parallel to the principal axis. The Ray (optics) will hit the mirror at an Angle of incidence of degrees. We say that the Ray (optics) hits the mirror normally. According to Specular reflection the Ray (optics) will be Reflection (physics) at degrees. The Ray (optics) then bounces back in the same Direction (geometry) We also project the Ray (optics) back behind the mirror because this is what your eye does. Another Light Ray (optics) leaves the top of the object and hits the mirror at its centre. This Ray (optics) will be Reflection (physics) at the same angle as its Angle of incidence as shown. If we project the Ray (optics) backward behind the mirror it will eventually cross the projection of the first Ray (optics) we drew. We have found the location of the image It is Virtual image since it appears in an area that Light cannot actually reach (behind the mirror). You can see from the diagram that the image is erect and is the same size as the object. This is exactly as we expected. We use dashed line to indicate that the image is virtual. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.4|Spherical Mirrors|150
The second class of mirrors that we will look at are Curved mirror These mirrors are called Curved mirror because if you take sphere and cut it as shown in Figure 7.16 and then polish the inside of one and the outside of the other you will get Curved mirror and Curved mirror as shown. These two mirrors will be studied in detail. The centre of curvature is the point at the centre of the sphere and describes how big the sphere is. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.5|Concave Mirrors|150
The first type of Curved mirror we will study are Curved mirror Curved mirror have the shape shown in Figure 7.17. As with Plane mirror the principal axis is line that is perpendicular to the centre of the mirror. If you think of Light Reflection (physics) off Curved mirror you will immediately see that things will look very different compared to Plane mirror The easiest way to understand what will happen is to draw Ray (optics) diagram and Work (physics) out where the images will form. Once we have done that it is easy to see what properties the image has. First we need to define very important characteristic of the mirror. We have seen that the centre of curvature is the centre of the sphere from which the mirror is cut. We then define that Distance that is half-way between the centre of curvature and the mirror on the principal axis. This point is known as the focal point and the Distance from the focal point to the mirror is known as the focal Length (symbol f). Since the focal point is the midpoint of the line segment joining the vertex and the center of curvature the focal Length would be one-half the radius of curvature. This fact can come in very handy remember if you know one then you know the other Definition: Focal Point The focal point of mirror is the midpoint of line segment joining the vertex and the centre of curvature. It is the Position (vector) at which all parallel Ray (optics) are focussed. Why are we making such big deal about this point we call the focal point? It has an important property we will use often. Ray (optics) parallel to the principal axis hitting the mirror will always be Reflection (physics) through the focal point. The focal point is the Position (vector) at which all parallel Ray (optics) are focussed. Figure 7.19: Curved mirror with three Ray (optics) drawn to locate the image. Each incident Ray (optics) is Reflection (physics) according to Specular reflection The intersection of the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) gives the location of the image. Here the image is real and inverted. From Figure 7.19 we see that the image created by Curved mirror is real and inverted as compared to the virtual and erect image created by Plane mirror Definition: Real image Real image can be cast on screen it is inverted and on the same side of the mirror as the object. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.6|Convex Mirrors|153
The second type of Curved mirror we will study are Curved mirror Curved mirror have the shape shown in Figure 7.20. As with Plane mirror the principal axis is line that is perpendicular to the centre of the mirror. We have defined the focal point as that point that is half-way along the principal axis between the centre of curvature and the mirror. Now for Curved mirror this point is behind the mirror. Curved mirror has negative focal Length because the focal point is behind the mirror. Figure 7.20: Curved mirror with principle axis focal point (F) and centre of curvature (C). The centre of the mirror is the Geometrical optics centre (O). To determine what the image from Curved mirror looks like and where the image is located we need to remember that mirror obeys Specular reflection and that Light appears to come from the image. The image created by Curved mirror is shown in Figure 7.21. Figure 7.21: Curved mirror with three Ray (optics) drawn to locate the image. Each incident Ray (optics) is Reflection (physics) according to Specular reflection The Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) diverge. If the Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) are extended behind the mirror then their intersection gives the location of the image behind the mirror. For Curved mirror the image is virtual and upright. From Figure 7.21 we see that the image created by Curved mirror is virtual and upright as compared to the real and inverted image created by Curved mirror Extension: Divergence Curved mirror is also known as diverging mirror. Light Ray (optics) appear to diverge from the focal point of Curved mirror 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.5.8|Magnification|154
In Figures 7.19 and 7.21 the height of the object and image arrows were different. In any Geometrical optics system where images are formed from objects the ratio of the image height hi to the object height ho is known as the Magnification m. hi ho This is true for the mirror examples we showed above and will also be true for lenses which will be introduced in the next sections. For Plane mirror the height of the image is the same as the height of the object so the Magnification is simply hi ho 1. If the Magnification is greater than the image is larger than the object and is said to be magnified. If the Magnification is less than the image is smaller than the object so the image is said to be diminished. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.6|Total Internal Reflection and Fibre Optics|156

---------------------------------------------------------

7.6.1|Total Internal Reflection|156
When we increase the Angle of incidence we reach point where the angle of Refraction is 90 and the Refraction Ray (optics) runs along the surface of the medium. This Angle of incidence is called the critical angle. Definition: Critical Angle The critical angle is the Angle of incidence where the angle of Reflection (physics) is 90. The Light must shine from dense to less dense medium. If the Angle of incidence is bigger than this critical angle the Refraction Ray (optics) will not emerge from the medium but will be Reflection (physics) back into the medium. This is called total internal Reflection (physics) Total internal Reflection (physics) takes place when Light shines from an Geometrical optics denser medium to an Geometrical optics less dense medium. the Angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. Definition: Total Internal Reflection (physics) Total internal Reflection (physics) takes place when Light is Reflection (physics) back into the medium because the Angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. Each medium has its own unique critical angle. For example the critical angle for glass is 42 and that of water is 488. We can calculate the critical angle for any medium. Calculating the Critical Angle Now we shall learn how to derive the value of the critical angle for two given media. The process is fairly simple and involves just the use of Snell's law that we have already studied. To recap Snell's law states: n1 sin n2 sin where n1 is the Refraction index of material n2 is the Refraction index of material is the Angle of incidence and is the angle of Refraction For total internal Reflection (physics) we know that the Angle of incidence is the critical angle. So c. However we also know that the angle of Refraction at the critical angle is 90. So we have: 90. We can then write Snell's law as: n1 sin n2 sin 90 Solving for gives: n1 sin n2 sin 90 sin n2 n1 (1) sin1 n2 n1 Important: Take care that for total internal Reflection (physics) the incident Ray (optics) is always in the denser medium. 
---------------------------------------------------------

7.6.2|Fibre Optics|161
Total internal Reflection (physics) is Power (physics) tool since it can be used to confine Light One of the most common applications of total internal Reflection (physics) is in fibre Geometrical optics An Geometrical optics fibre is thin transparent fibre usually made of glass or Plasticity (physics) for transmitting Light Geometrical optics fibres are usually thinner than human hair The construction of single Geometrical optics fibre is shown in Figure 7.23. The basic functional structure of an Geometrical optics fibre consists of an outer protective cladding and an inner core through which Light pulses travel. The overall diameter of the fibre is about 125 (125106m) and that of the core is just about 10 (10106m). The mode of operation of the Geometrical optics fibres as mentioned above depends on the phenomenon of total internal Reflection (physics) The difference in Refraction index of the cladding and the core allows total internal Reflection (physics) in the same way as happens at an air-water surface. If Light is incident on cable end with an Angle of incidence greater than the critical angle then the Light will remain trapped inside the glass strand. In this way Light travels very quickly down the Length of the cable. Fibre Geometrical optics in Telecommunications Geometrical optics fibres are most common in telecommunications because information can be transported over long Distance with minimal loss of data. The minimised loss of data gives Geometrical optics fibres an advantage over conventional cables. Data is transmitted from one end of the fibre to another in the form of Laser pulses. single strand is capable of handling over 3000 simultaneous transmissions which is huge improvement over the conventional co-axial cables. Multiple signal transmission is achieved by sending individual Light pulses at slightly different angles. For example if one of the pulses makes 7223 Angle of incidence then separate pulse can be sent at an angle of 7226 The transmitted data is received almost instantaneously at the other end of the cable since the information coded onto the Laser travels at the Speed of Light During transmission over long Distance repeater stations are used to amplify the signal which has weakened somewhat by the time it reaches the station. The amplified signals are then relayed towards their destination and may encounter several other repeater stations on the way. Fibre Geometrical optics in Medicine Geometrical optics fibres are used in medicine in endoscopes. The main part of an endoscope is the Geometrical optics fibre. Light is shone down the Geometrical optics fibre and medical doctor can use the endoscope to look inside patient. Endoscopes are used to examine the inside of patients stomach by inserting the endoscope down the patients throat. Endoscopes allow minimally invasive surgery. This means that person can be diagnosed and treated through small incision. This has advantages over open surgery because endoscopy is quicker and cheaper and the patient recovers more quickly. The alternative is open surgery which is expensive requires more time and is more traumatic for the patient. Endoscopy means to look inside and refers to looking inside the human body for diagnosing medical conditions.

8|Magnetism|167

---------------------------------------------------------

8.1|Introduction|167
Magnet is the Force that Magnet object exerts through its Magnet Field (physics) on another object. The two objects do not have to Physics touch each other for the Force to be exerted. Object feels the Magnet Force from Object because of Object 1s surrounding Magnet Field (physics) Humans have known about Magnet for many thousands of years. For example lodestone is magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite. It has the property of attracting iron objects. It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records from around 800 BCE in Europe and around 600 BCE in Asia. The root of the English word Magnet is from the Greek word magnes probably from Magnesia in Asia Minor once an important source of lodestone. 
---------------------------------------------------------

8.2|Magnetic fields|167
Magnet Field (physics) is region in space where Magnet or object made of ferromagnetic material will experience non-contact Force Electron moving inside any object have Magnet Field (physics) associated with them. In most materials these Field (physics) point in all Direction (geometry) so the net Magnet Field (physics) is zero. For example in the Plasticity (physics) ball below the Direction (geometry) of the Magnet Field (physics) of the Electron (shown by the arrows) are pointing in different Direction (geometry) and cancel each other out. Therefore the Plasticity (physics) ball is not Magnet and has no Magnet Field (physics) In some materials (e.g. iron) called ferromagnetic materials there are regions called domains where these Magnet Field (physics) line up. All the atoms in each domain group together so that the Magnet Field (physics) from their Electron point the same way. The picture shows piece of an iron needle zoomed in to show the domains with the Electric field lined up inside them. In permanent Magnet many domains are lined up resulting in net Magnet Field (physics) Objects made from ferromagnetic materials can be magnetised for example by rubbing Magnet along the object in one Direction (geometry) This causes the Magnet Field (physics) of most or all of the domains to line up and cause the object to have Magnet Field (physics) and be Magnet Once ferromagnetic object has been magnetised it can stay Magnet without another Magnet being nearby (i.e. without being in another Magnet Field (physics) In the picture below the needle has been magnetised because the Magnet Field (physics) in all the domains are pointing in the same Direction (geometry) 
---------------------------------------------------------

8.3|Permanent magnets|169

---------------------------------------------------------

8.3.1|The poles of permanent magnets|169
Because the domains in permanent Magnet all line up in particular Direction (geometry) the Magnet has pair of opposite poles called north (usually shortened to N) and south (usually shortened to S). Even if the Magnet is cut into tiny pieces each piece will still have both and pole. These poles always occur in pairs. In nature we never find north Magnet pole or south Magnet pole on its own. Magnet Field (physics) are different to gravitational and Electric field In nature Position (vector) and negative Electric charge can be found on their own but you never find just north Magnet pole or south Magnet pole on its own. On the very small scale zooming in to the size of atoms Magnet Field (physics) are caused by moving Electric charge (i.e. the Electric charge Electron 
---------------------------------------------------------

8.3.2|Magnetic attraction and repulsion|169
Like poles of Magnet repel one another whilst unlike poles attract. This means that two poles or two poles will push away from each other while pole and pole will be drawn towards each other. Definition: Attraction and Repulsion Like poles of Magnet repel each other whilst unlike poles attract each other. 
---------------------------------------------------------

8.3.3|Representing magnetic fields|170
Magnet Field (physics) can be represented using Magnet Field (physics) lines. Although the Magnet Field (physics) of permanent Magnet is everywhere surrounding the Magnet (in all dimensions) we draw only some of the Field (physics) lines to represent the Field (physics) (usually only dimensions are shown in drawings). In areas where the Magnet Field (physics) is strong the Field (physics) lines are closer together. Where the Field (physics) is weaker the Field (physics) lines are drawn further apart. The Strength of materials of Magnet Field (physics) is referred to as the Magnet flux Important: 1. Field (physics) lines never cross. 2. Arrows drawn on the Field (physics) lines indicate the Direction (geometry) of the Field (physics) 3. Magnet Field (physics) points from the north to the south pole of Magnet As the activity shows one can map the Magnet Field (physics) of Magnet by placing it underneath piece of paper and sprinkling iron filings on top. The iron filings line themselves up parallel to the Magnet Field (physics) Another tool one can use to find the Direction (geometry) of Magnet Field (physics) is Compass The Compass arrow points in the Direction (geometry) of the Field (physics) As already said opposite poles of Magnet attract each other and bringing them together causes their Magnet Field (physics) lines to converge (come together). Like poles of Magnet repel each other and bringing them together causes their Magnet Field (physics) lines to diverge (bend out from each other). Extension: Ferromagnetism and Retentivity Ferromagnetism is phenomenon shown by materials like iron nickel or cobalt. These materials can form permanent Magnet They always magnetise so as to be attracted to Magnet no matter which Magnet pole is brought toward the unmagnetised ironnickelcobalt. The ability of ferromagnetic material to retain its magnetisation after an external Field (physics) is removed is called its retentivity. Paramagnetic materials are materials like aluminium or platinum which become magnetised in an external Magnet Field (physics) in similar way to ferromagnetic materials. However they lose their Magnet when the external Magnet Field (physics) is removed. Diamagnetism is shown by materials like copper or bismuth which become mag- netised in Magnet Field (physics) with polarity opposite to the external Magnet Field (physics) Unlike iron they are slightly repelled by Magnet 
---------------------------------------------------------

8.4|The compass and the earth's magnetic field|173
Compass is an instrument which is used to find the Direction (geometry) of Magnet Field (physics) It can do this because Compass consists of small metal needle which is magnetised itself and which is free to turn in any Direction (geometry) Therefore when in the presence of Magnet Field (physics) the needle is able to line up in the same Direction (geometry) as the Field (physics) Lodestone magnetised form of iron-oxide was found to orientate itself in north-south Direction (geometry) if left free to rotate by suspension on string or on float in water. Lodestone was therefore used as an early navigational Compass Compass are mainly used in navigation to find Direction (geometry) on the earth. This Work (physics) because the earth itself has Magnet Field (physics) which is similar to that of bar Magnet (see the picture below). The Compass needle aligns with the Magnet Field (physics) Direction (geometry) and points north (or south). Once you know where north is you can figure out any other Direction (geometry) picture of Compass is shown below: Some animals can detect Magnet Field (physics) which helps them orientate themselves and find di- rection. Animals which can do this include pigeons bees Monarch butterflies sea turtles and fish. 
---------------------------------------------------------

8.4.1|The earth's magnetic field|175
In the picture below you can see representation of the earths Magnet Field (physics) which is very similar to the Magnet Field (physics) of giant bar Magnet like the one on the right of the picture. So the earth has two sets of north poles and south poles: geographic poles and Magnet poles. The earths Magnet Field (physics) is thought to be caused by churning liquid metals in the core which causes electric Electric current and Magnet Field (physics) From the picture you can see that the Direction (geometry) of Magnet north and true north are not identical. The geographic north pole which is the point through which the earths rotation axis goes is about 115o away from the Direction (geometry) of the Magnet north pole (which is where Compass will point). However the Magnet poles shift slightly all the time. Another interesting thing to note is that if we think of the earth as big bar Magnet and we know that Magnet Field (physics) lines always point from north to south then the Compass tells us that what we call the Magnet north pole is actually the south pole of the bar Magnet The Direction (geometry) of the earths Magnet Field (physics) flips Direction (geometry) about once every 200 000 years You can picture this as bar Magnet whose north and south pole periodically switch sides. The reason for this is still not fully understood. The earths Magnet Field (physics) is very important for humans and other animals on earth because it stops Electric charge particles emitted by the sun from hitting the earth and us. Electric charge particles can also damage and cause interference with telecommunications (such as cell phones). Electric charge particles (mainly protons and Electron are emitted by the sun in what is called the solar wind and travel towards the earth. These particles spiral in the earths Magnet Field (physics) towards the poles. If they Collision with other particles in the earths atmosphere they sometimes cause red or green Light or glow in the sky which is called the aurora. This happens close to the north and south pole and so we cannot see the aurora from South Africa.

9|Electrostatics|177

---------------------------------------------------------

9.1|Introduction|177
Electrostatics is the study of Electric charge which is static (not moving). 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.2|Two kinds of charge|177
All objects surrounding us (including people) contain large amounts of Electric charge There are two types of Electric charge Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge If the same amounts of negative and Position (vector) Electric charge are brought together they neutralise each other and there is no net Electric charge Neutral objects are objects which contain Position (vector) and Electric charge but in equal numbers. However if there is little bit more of one type of Electric charge than the other on the object then the object is said to be Electric charge The picture below shows what the distribution of Electric charge might look like for neutral Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge object. There are: Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge (-6) There is zero net Electric charge The object is neutral Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge (-6) The net Electric charge is +2 The object is Position (vector) Electric charge Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge (-9) -3 The net Electric charge is -3 The object is Electric charge 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.3|Unit of charge|177
Electric charge is measured in units called Coulomb (C). Coulomb of Electric charge is very large Electric charge In Electrostatics we therefore often Work (physics) with Electric charge in Coulomb (1 106 C) and Coulomb (1 nC 109 C). 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.4|Conservation of charge|177
Objects can become Electric charge by contact or by rubbing them. This means that they can gain extra negative or Position (vector) Electric charge Electric charge happens when you for example rub your feet against the carpet. When you then touch something metallic or another person you will feel shock as the excess Electric charge that you have collected is discharged. Important: Electric charge just like Energy cannot be created or destroyed. We say that Electric charge is conserved. When you rub your feet against the carpet Electric charge is transferred to you from the carpet. The carpet will then become Position (vector) Electric charge by the same amount. Another example is to take two neutral objects such as Plasticity (physics) ruler and cotton cloth (handkerchief). To begin the two objects are neutral (i.e. have the same amounts of Position (vector) and Electric charge +- +- +- +- -+- +- The ruler has postive Electric charge and The neutral cotton cloth has Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge The total number of Electric charge is: (9+5)14 Position (vector) Electric charge (9+5)14 Electric charge Electric charge BEFORE rubbing: Now if the cotton cloth is used to rub the ruler Electric charge is transferred from the cloth to the ruler. The ruler is now Electric charge and the cloth is Position (vector) Electric charge If you count up all the Position (vector) and Electric charge at the beginning and the end there are still the same amount. i.e. total Electric charge has been conserved +- +- +- +- -+- +- The ruler has postive Electric charge and The cotton cloth has Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge The total number of Electric charge is: (9+5)14 Position (vector) Electric charge (12+2)14 Electric charge 12 Electric charge AFTER rubbing: It is now Position (vector) Electric charge 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.5|Force between Charges|178
The Force exerted by non-moving (static) Electric charge on each other is called the Electrostatics Force The Electrostatics Force between: like Electric charge is repulsive opposite (unlike) Electric charge is attractive. In other words like Electric charge repel each other while opposite Electric charge attract each other. This is different to the gravitational Force which is only attractive. attractive Force repulsive Force repulsive Force The closer together the Electric charge are the stronger the Electrostatics Force between them. weaker repulsive Force stronger repulsive Force (shorter Distance between Electric charge (longer Distance between Electric charge Extension: Electrostatics Force The Electrostatics Force determines the arrangement of Electric charge on the surface of con- ductors. When we place Electric charge on spherical Electrical conductor the repulsive Force between the individual like Electric charge cause them to spread uniformly over the sur- face of the sphere. However for Electrical conductor with non-regular shapes there is concentration of Electric charge near the point or points of the object. This collection of Electric charge can actually allow Electric charge to leak off the Electrical conductor if the point is sharp enough. It is for this reason that buildings often have lightning rod on the roof to remove any Electric charge the building has collected. This minimises the possibility of the building being struck by lightning. This spreading out of Electric charge would not occur if we were to place the Electric charge on an Insulator (electricity) since Electric charge cannot move in Insulator (electricity) The word Electron comes from the Greek word for amber. The ancient Greeks observed that if you rubbed piece of amber you could use it to pick up bits of straw. 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.6|Conductors and insulators|181
All atoms are Electric charge i.e. they have the same amounts of negative and Position (vector) Electric charge inside them. By convention the Electron carry Electric charge and the protons carry Position (vector) Electric charge The basic unit of Electric charge called the elementary Electric charge is the amount of Electric charge carried by one Electron All the matter and materials on earth are made up of atoms. Some materials allow Electron to move relatively freely through them (e.g. most metals the human body). These materials are called Electrical conductor Other materials do not allow the Electric charge carriers the Electron to move through them (e.g. Plasticity (physics) glass). The Electron are bound to the atoms in the material. These materials are called non-conductors or Insulator (electricity) If an excess of Electric charge is placed on an Insulator (electricity) it will stay where it is put and there will be concentration of Electric charge in that area of the object. However if an excess of Electric charge is placed on Electrical conductor the like Electric charge will repel each other and spread out over the surface of the object. When two Electrical conductor are made to touch the total Electric charge on them is shared between the two. If the two Electrical conductor are identical then each Electrical conductor will be left with half of the total Electric charge Extension: Electric charge and Electron The basic unit of Electric charge namely the elementary Electric charge is carried by the Electron (equal to 1.6021019 C). In conducting material (e.g. copper) when the atoms bond to form the material some of the outermost loosely bound Electron become detached from the individual atoms and so become free to move around. The Electric charge carried by these Electron can move around in the material. In Insulator (electricity) there are very few if any free Electron and so the Electric charge cannot move around in the material. 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.6.1|The electroscope|182
The Electroscope is very sensitive instrument which can be used to detect Electric charge diagram of gold leaf Electroscope is shown the figure below. The Electroscope consists of glass container with metal rod inside which has thin pieces of gold foil attached. The other end of the metal rod has metal plate attached to it outside the glass container. The Electroscope detects Electric charge in the following way: Electric charge object like the Position (vector) Electric charge rod in the picture is brought close to (but not touching) the neutral metal plate of the Electroscope This causes Electric charge in the gold foil metal rod and metal plate to be attracted to the Position (vector) rod. Because the metal (gold is metal too) is Electrical conductor the Electric charge can move freely from the foil up the metal rod and onto the metal plate. There is now more Electric charge on the plate and more Position (vector) Electric charge on the gold foil leaves. This is called inducing Electric charge on the metal plate. It is important to remember that the Electroscope is still neutral (the total Position (vector) and Electric charge are the same) the Electric charge have just been induced to move to different parts of the instrument The induced Position (vector) Electric charge on the gold leaves Force them apart since like Electric charge repel This is how we can tell that the rod is Electric charge If the rod is now moved away from the metal plate the Electric charge in the Electroscope will spread itself out evenly again and the leaves will fall down again because there will no longer be an induced Electric charge on them. Grounding If you were to bring the Electric charge rod close to the uncharged Electroscope and then you touched the metal plate with your finger at the same time this would cause Electric charge to flow up from the ground (the earth) through your body onto the metal plate. This is called grounding. The Electric charge flowing onto the plate is opposite to the Electric charge on the rod since it is attracted to the rod. Therefore for our picture the Electric charge flowing onto the plate would be negative. Now Electric charge has been added to the Electroscope It is no longer neutral but has an excess of Electric charge Now if we move the rod away the leaves will remain apart because they have an excess of Electric charge and they repel each other. 
---------------------------------------------------------

9.7|Attraction between charged and uncharged objects|183

---------------------------------------------------------

9.7.1|Polarisation of Insulators|183
Unlike Electrical conductor the Electron in Insulator (electricity) (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the Insulator (electricity) and cannot move around freely in the material. However Electric charge object can still exert Force on neutral Insulator (electricity) through the concept of polarisation. If Position (vector) Electric charge rod is brought close to neutral Insulator (electricity) such as polystyrene it can attract the bound Electron to move round to the side of the atoms which is closest to the rod and cause the Position (vector) nuclei to move slightly to the opposite side of the atoms. This process is called polarisation. Although it is very small Optical microscope effect if there are many atoms and the polarised object is Light (e.g. small polystyrene ball) it can add up to enough Force to be attracted onto the Electric charge rod. Remember that the polystyrene is only polarised not Electric charge The polystyrene ball is still neutral since no Electric charge was added or removed from it. The picture shows not-to-scale view of the polarised atoms in the polystyrene ball: Some materials are made up of molecules which are already polarised. These are molecules which have more Position (vector) and more negative side but are still neutral overall. Just as polarised polystyrene ball can be attracted to Electric charge rod these materials are also affected if brought close to Electric charge object. Water is an example of substance which is made of polarised molecules. If Position (vector) Electric charge rod is brought close to stream of water the molecules can rotate so that the negative sides all line up towards the rod. The stream of water will then be attracted to the rod since opposite Electric charge attract. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10|Electric Circuits|187

---------------------------------------------------------

10.1|Electric Circuits|187
In South Africa people depend on electricity to provide Power (physics) for most appliances in the home at Work (physics) and out in the world in general. For example flourescent Light electric heating and cooking (on electric stoves) all depend on electricity to Work (physics) To realise just how big an impact electricity has on our daily lives just think about what happens when there is Power (physics) failure or load shedding. Important: Safety Warning: We believe in experimenting and learning about Physics at every opportunity BUT playing with electricity can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS Do not try to build home made circuits alone. Make sure you have someone with you who knows if what you are doing is safe. Normal electrical outlets are dangerous. Treat electricity with respect in your everyday life. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.1.1|Closed circuits|187
In the experiment above you will have seen that the Light bulb only glows when there is closed circuit i.e. there are no gaps in the circuit and all the circuit elements are connected in closed loop. Therefore in order for Electric charge to flow closed circuit and an Energy source (in this case the battery) are needed. (Note: you do not have to have lightbulb in the circuit We used this as check that Electric charge was flowing.) Definition: Electric circuit An electric circuit is closed path (with no breaks or gaps) along which Electric charge Electron flow Power (physics) by an Energy source. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.1.2|Representing electric circuits|188
Components of electrical circuits Some common elements (components) which can be found in electrical circuits include Light bulbs batteries connecting leads switches resistors Voltmeter and Ammeter You will learn more about these items in later sections but it is important to know what their symbols are and how to represent them in circuit diagrams. Below is table with the items and their symbols: Circuit diagrams Definition: Representing circuits Physics circuit is the electric circuit you create with real components. circuit diagram is drawing which uses symbols to represent the different components in the Physics circuit. We use circuit diagrams to represent circuits because they are much simpler and more general than drawing the Physics circuit because they only show the Work (physics) of the electrical compo- nents. You can see this in the two pictures below. The first picture shows the Physics circuit for an electric torch. You can see the Light bulb the batteries the switch and the outside Plasticity (physics) casing of the torch. The picture is actually cross-section of the torch so that we can see inside it. Figure 10.1: Physics components of an electric torch. The dotted line shows the path of the electrical circuit. Below is the circuit diagram for the electric torch. Now the Light bulb is represented by its symbol as are the batteries the switch and the connecting wires. It is not necessary to show the Plasticity (physics) casing of the torch since it has nothing to do with the electric Work (physics) of the torch. You can see that the circuit diagram is much simpler than the Physics circuit drawing Series and Series and parallel circuits There are two ways to connect electrical components in Series and parallel circuits or in parallel. Definition: Series Series and parallel circuits circuit the Electric charge has single path from the battery returning to the battery. Definition: Series and parallel circuits In Series and parallel circuits the Electric charge has multiple paths from the battery returning to the battery. The picture below shows circuit with three resistors connected in series on the left and circuit with three resistors connected in parallel on the right: 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.2|Potential Difference|192

---------------------------------------------------------

10.2.1|Potential Difference|192
When circuit is connected and is complete circuit Electric charge can move through the circuit. Electric charge will not move unless there is reason Force Think of it as though Electric charge is at rest and something has to push it along. This means that Work (physics) needs to be done to make Electric charge move. Force acts on the Electric charge doing Work (physics) to make them move. The Force is provided by the battery in the circuit. We call the moving Electric charge Electric current and we will talk about this later. The Position (vector) of the Electric charge in the circuit tells you how much Potential energy it has because of the Force being exerted on it. This is like the Force from Gravity the higher an object is above the ground Position (vector) the more Potential energy it has. The amount of Work (physics) to move Electric charge from one point to another point is how much the Potential energy has changed. This is the difference in Potential energy called Voltage Notice that it is difference between the value of Potential energy at two points so we say that Voltage is measured between or across two points. We do not say Voltage through something. Definition: Voltage Electric potential as the difference in Electric potential energy per unit Electric charge between two points. The units of Voltage are the volt (V). The units are volt (V) which is the same as Joule per Coulomb the amount of Work (physics) done per unit Electric charge Electric potential is also called Voltage 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.2.2|Potential Difference and Parallel Resistors|193
When resistors are connected in parallel the start and end points for all the resistors are the same. These points have the same Potential energy and so the Voltage between them is the same no matter what is put in between them. You can have one two or many resistors between the two points the Voltage will not change. You can ignore whatever components are between two points in circuit when calculating the difference between the two points. Look at the following circuit diagrams. The battery is the same in all cases all that changes is more resistors are added between the points marked by the black dots. If we were to measure the Voltage between the two dots in these circuits we would get the same answer for all three cases. Lets look at two resistors in parallel more closely. When you construct circuit you use wires and you might think that measuring the Voltage in different places on the wires will make difference. This is not true. The Voltage or Voltage measurement will only be different if you measure different set of components. All points on the wires that have no circuit components between them will give you the same measurements. All three of the measurements shown in the picture below will give you the same Voltage The different measurement points on the left have no components between them so there is no change in Potential energy Exactly the same applies to the different points on the right. When you measure the Voltage between the points on the left and right you will get the same answer. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.2.3|Potential Difference and Series Resistors|194
When resistors are in series one after the other there is Voltage across each resistor. The total Voltage across set of resistors in series is the sum of the Voltage across each of the resistors in the set. This is the same as falling large Distance under Gravity or falling that same Distance (difference) in many smaller steps. The total Distance (difference) is the same. Look at the circuits below. If we measured the Voltage between the black dots in all of these circuits it would be the same just like we saw above. So we now know the total Voltage is the same across one two or three resistors. We also know that some Work (physics) is required to make Electric charge flow through each one each is step down in Potential energy These steps add up to the total drop which we know is the difference between the two dots. Let us look at this in bit more detail. In the picture below you can see what the different measurements for identical resistors in series could look like. The total Voltage across all three resistors is the sum of the Voltage across the individual resistors. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.2.4|Ohm's Law|194
The Voltage is the change in Potential energy or Work (physics) done when Electric charge moves between two points in the circuit. The greater the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance to Electric charge moving the more Work (physics) that needs to be done. The Work (physics) done or Voltage thus depends on the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance The Voltage is proportional to the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Definition: Ohm Law Voltage across circuit component is proportional to the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the component. Use the fact that Voltage is proportional to Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance to calculate what proportion of the total Voltage of circuit will be found across each circuit element. We know that the total Voltage is equal to V1 in the first circuit to V1 V2 in the second circuit and V1 V2 V3 in the third circuit. We know that the Potential energy lost across resistor is proportional to the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the component. The total Voltage is shared evenly across the total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the circuit. This means that the Voltage per unit of Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is Then the Voltage across resistor is just the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance times the Voltage per unit of Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.2.5|EMF|195
When you measure the Voltage across (or between) the terminals of battery you are measuring the electromotive Force Electromotive force of the battery. This is how much Potential energy the battery has to make Electric charge move through the circuit. This driving Potential energy is equal to the total Potential energy drops in the circuit. This means that the Voltage across the battery is equal to the sum of the Voltage in the circuit. We can use this information to solve problems in which the Voltage across elements in circuit add up to the Electromotive force Electromotive force Vtotal 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.3|Current|198

---------------------------------------------------------

10.3.1|Flow of Charge|198
We have been talking about moving Electric charge We need to be able to deal with numbers how much Electric charge is moving how fast is it moving? The concept that gives us this information is called Electric current Electric current allows us to quantify the movement of Electric charge When we talk about Electric current we talk about how much Electric charge moves past fixed point in circuit in one second. Think of Electric charge being pushed around the circuit by the battery there are Electric charge in the wires but unless there is battery they wont move. When one Electric charge moves the Electric charge next to it also move. They keep their spacing. If you had tube of marbles like in this picture. marble marble If you push one marble into the tube one must come out the other side. If you look at any point in the tube and push one marble into the tube one marble will move past the point you are looking at. This is similar to Electric charge in the wires of circuit. If Electric charge moves they all move and the same number move at every point in the circuit. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.3.2|Current|198
Now that weve thought about the moving Electric charge and visualised what is happening we need to get back to quantifying moving Electric charge Ive already told you that we use Electric current but we still need to define it. Definition: Electric current Electric current is the rate at which Electric charge moves past fixed point in circuit. We use the symbol to show Electric current and it is measured in amperes (A). One ampere is one Coulomb of Electric charge moving in one second. When Electric current flows in circuit we show this on diagram by adding arrows. The arrows show the Direction (geometry) of flow in circuit. By convention we say that Electric charge flows from the Position (vector) terminal on battery to the negative terminal. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.3.3|Series Circuits|199
In Series and parallel circuits the Electric charge has single path from the battery returning to the battery. The arrows in this picture show you the Direction (geometry) that Electric charge will flow in the circuit. They dont show you much Electric charge will flow only the Direction (geometry) Benjamin Franklin made guess about the Direction (geometry) of Electric charge flow when rubbing smooth wax with rough wool. He thought that the Electric charge flowed from the wax to the wool (i.e. from Position (vector) to negative) which was opposite to the real Direction (geometry) Due to this Electron are said to have Electric charge and so objects which Ben Franklin called negative (meaning shortage of Electric charge really have an excess of Electron By the time the true Direction (geometry) of Electron flow was discovered the convention of Position (vector) and negative had already been so well accepted in the scientific world that no effort was made to change it. Important: cell does not produce the same amount of Electric current no matter what is connected to it. While the Voltage produced by cell is constant the amount of Electric current supplied depends on what is in the circuit. How does the Electric current through the battery in circuit with several resistors in series compare to the Electric current in circuit with single resistor? 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.3.4|Parallel Circuits|200
How does the Electric current through the battery in circuit with several resistors in parallel compare to the Electric current in circuit with single resistor? Why is this the case? Why do more resistors make it easier for Electric charge to flow in the circuit? It is because they are in parallel so there are more paths for Electric charge to take to move. You can think of it like highway with more lanes or the tube of marbles splitting into multiple parallel tubes. The more branches there are the easier it is for Electric charge to flow. You will learn more about the total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of parallel resistors later but always remember that more resistors in parallel mean more pathways. In series the pathways come one after the other so it does not make it easier for Electric charge to flow. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.4|Resistance|202

---------------------------------------------------------

10.4.1|What causes resistance?|202
We have spoken about resistors that slow down the flow of Electric charge in Electrical conductor On Optical microscope level Electron moving through the Electrical conductor Collision with the particles of which the Electrical conductor (metal) is made. When they Collision they transfer kinetic Energy The Electron therefore lose kinetic Energy and slow down. This leads to Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance The transferred Energy causes the Electrical conductor to heat up. You can feel this directly if you touch cellphone charger when you are Electric charge cell phone the charger gets warm Definition: Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance slows down the flow of Electric charge in circuit. We use the symbol to show Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance and it is measured in units called Ohm with the symbol Ohm Volt Ampere All Electrical conductor have some Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance For example piece of wire has less Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance than Light bulb but both have Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance The high Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the filament (small wire) in lightbulb causes the Electron to transfer lot of their kinetic Energy in the form of heat. The heat Energy is enough to cause the filament to glow white-hot which produces Light The wires connecting the lamp to the cell or battery hardly even get warm while conducting the same amount of Electric current This is because of their much lower Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance due to their larger cross-section (they are thicker). An important effect of resistor is that it converts electrical Energy into other forms of Energy such as heat and Light There is special type of Electrical conductor called superconductor that has no Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance but the materials that make up superconductors only start supercon- ducting at very low Temperature (approximately -170C). Why do batteries go flat? battery stores chemical Potential energy When it is connected in circuit chemical reaction takes place inside the battery which converts chemical Potential energy to electrical Energy which Power (physics) the Electron to move through the circuit. All the circuit elements (such as the conducting leads resistors and lightbulbs) have some Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance to the flow of Electric charge and convert the electrical Energy to heat andor Light The battery goes flat when all its chemical Potential energy has been converted into other forms of Energy 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.4.2|Resistors in electric circuits|202
It is important to understand what effect adding resistors to circuit has on the total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of circuit and on the Electric current that can flow in the circuit. Resistors in series When we add resistors in series to circuit we increase the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance to the flow of Electric current There is only one path that the Electric current can flow down and the Electric current is the same at all places in the Series and parallel circuits Take look at the diagram below: On the left there is circuit with single resistor and battery. No matter where we measure the Electric current it is the same in Series and parallel circuits On the right we have added second resistor in series to the circuit. The total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the circuit has increased and you can see from the reading on the Ammeter that the Electric current in the circuit has decreased. Resistors in parallel In contrast to the series case when we add resistors in parallel we create more paths along which Electric current can flow. By doing this we decrease the total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the circuit Take look at the diagram below. On the left we have the same circuit as in the previous diagram with battery and resistor. The Ammeter shows Electric current of ampere. On the right we have added second resistor in parallel to the first resistor. This has increased the number of paths (branches) the Electric charge can take through the circuit the total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance has decreased. You can see that the Electric current in the circuit has increased. Also notice that the Electric current in the different branches can be different.

10.5|Instruments to Measure voltage, current and resistance|204
As we have seen in previous sections an electric circuit is made up of number of different components such as batteries resistors and Light bulbs. There are devices to measure the properties of these components. These devices are called Metre For example one may be interested in measuring the amount of Electric current flowing through circuit using an Ammeter or measuring the Voltage provided by battery using Voltmeter In this section we will discuss the practical usage of Voltmeter Ammeter and Ohmmeter 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.5.1|Voltmeter|204
Voltmeter is an instrument for measuring the Voltage between two points in an electric circuit. In analogy with water circuit Voltmeter is like Metre designed to measure pressure difference. Since one is interested in measuring the Voltage between two points in circuit Voltmeter must be connected in parallel with the portion of the circuit on which the measurement is made. Figure 10.3: Voltmeter should be connected in parallel in circuit. Figure 10.3 shows Voltmeter connected in parallel with battery. One lead of the Voltmeter is connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end. The Voltmeter may also be used to measure the Voltage across resistor or any other component of circuit that has Voltage drop. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.5.2|Ammeter|204
An Ammeter is an instrument used to measure the flow of electric Electric current in circuit. Since one is interested in measuring the Electric current flowing through circuit component the Ammeter must be connected in series with the measured circuit component (Figure 10.4). 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.5.3|Ohmmeter|204
An Ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance The basic Ohmmeter can function much like an Ammeter The Ohmmeter Work (physics) by suppling constant Voltage to the resistor and measuring the Electric current flowing through it. The measured Electric current is then converted into corresponding Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance reading through Ohm Law. Ohmmeter only function correctly when measuring Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance that is not being Power (physics) by Voltage or Electric current source. In other words you cannot measure the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of component that is already connected to circuit. This is because the Ohmmeter accurate indication depends only on its own source of Voltage The presence of any other Voltage across the measured circuit component interferes with the Ohmmeter operation. Figure 10.5 shows an Ohmmeter connected with resistor. 
---------------------------------------------------------

10.5.4|Meters Impact on Circuit|205
good quality Metre used correctly will not significantly change the values it is used to measure. This means that an Ammeter has very low Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance to not slow down the flow of Electric charge Voltmeter has very high Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance so that it does not add another parallel pathway to the circuit for the Electric charge to flow along. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11|Vectors|211

---------------------------------------------------------

11.1|Introduction|211
This chapter focuses on Euclidean vector We will learn what is Euclidean vector how it differs from everyday numbers how to add subtract and multiply them and where they appear in Physics Are Euclidean vector Physics No Euclidean vector themselves are not Physics Physics is just description of the world around us. To describe something we need to use language. The most common language used to describe Physics is Mathematics. Euclidean vector form very important part of the mathematical description of Physics so much so that it is absolutely essential to master the use of Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.2|Scalars and Vectors|211
In Mathematics you learned that number is something that represents quantity. For example if you have books apples and bicycle the and represent how many of each item you have. These kinds of numbers are known as Scalar (mathematics) Definition: Scalar (mathematics) Scalar (mathematics) is quantity that has only magnitude (size). An extension to Scalar (mathematics) is Euclidean vector which is Scalar (mathematics) with Direction (geometry) For example if you travel km down Main Road to school the quantity km down Main Road is Euclidean vector The km is the quantity (or Scalar (mathematics) and the down Main Road gives Direction (geometry) In Physics we use the word magnitude to refer to the Scalar (mathematics) part of the Euclidean vector Definition: Euclidean vector Euclidean vector is quantity that has both magnitude and Direction (geometry) Euclidean vector should tell you how much and which way. For example man is driving his car east along freeway at 100 kmhr1. What we have given here is Euclidean vector the Velocity The car is moving at 100 kmhr1(this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going east (this is the Direction (geometry) Thus we know the Speed and Direction (geometry) of the car. These two quantities magnitude and Direction (geometry) form Euclidean vector we call Velocity 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.3|Notation|211
Euclidean vector are different to Scalar (mathematics) and therefore has its own notation. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.3.1|Mathematical Representation|212
There are many ways of writing the symbol for Euclidean vector Euclidean vector are denoted by symbols with an arrow pointing to the right above it. For example and represent the Euclidean vector acceleration Velocity and Force meaning they have both magnitude and Direction (geometry) Sometimes just the magnitude of Euclidean vector is needed. In this case the arrow is omitted. In other words denotes the magnitude of Euclidean vector F. F| is another way of representing the magnitude of Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.3.2|Graphical Representation|212
Euclidean vector are drawn as arrows. An arrow has both magnitude (how long it is) and Direction (geometry) (the Direction (geometry) in which it points). The starting point of Euclidean vector is known as the tail and the end point is known as the head. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.4|Directions|212
There are many acceptable methods of writing Euclidean vector As long as the Euclidean vector has magnitude and Direction (geometry) it is most likely acceptable. These different methods come from the different methods of expressing Direction (geometry) for Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.4.1|Relative Directions|212
The simplest method of expressing Direction (geometry) is relative Direction (geometry) to the left to the right forward backward up and down. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.4.2|Compass Directions|213
Another common method of expressing direc- tions is to use the points of Compass North South East and West. If Euclidean vector does not point exactly in one of the Compass Direction (geometry) then we use an angle. For example we can have Euclidean vector pointing 40 North of West. Start with the Euclidean vector pointing along the West Direction (geometry) Then rotate the Euclidean vector towards the north until there is 40 angle between the Euclidean vector and the West. The Direction (geometry) of this Euclidean vector can also be described as: 40 (West 40 North) or 50 (North 50 West) 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.4.3|Bearing|213
The final method of expressing Direction (geometry) is to use bearing. bearing is Direction (geometry) relative to fixed point. Given just an angle the convention is to define the angle with respect to the North. So Euclidean vector with Direction (geometry) of 110 has been rotated clockwise 110 relative to the North. bearing is always written as three digit number for example 275 or 080 (for 80). 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.5|Drawing Vectors|214
In order to draw Euclidean vector accurately we must specify scale and include reference Direction (geometry) in the diagram. scale allows us to translate the Length of the arrow into the Euclidean vector magnitude. For instance if one chose scale of cm (1 cm represents N) Force of 20 towards the East would be represented as an arrow 10 cm long. reference Direction (geometry) may be line representing horizontal surface or the points of Compass Method: Drawing Euclidean vector 1. Decide upon scale and write it down. 2. Determine the Length of the arrow representing the Euclidean vector by using the scale. 3. Draw the Euclidean vector as an arrow. Make sure that you fill in the arrow head. 4. Fill in the magnitude of the Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.6|Mathematical Properties of Vectors|215
Euclidean vector are mathematical objects and we need to understand the mathematical properties of Euclidean vector like adding and subtracting. For all the examples in this section we will use Displacement (vector) as our Euclidean vector quantity. Displacement (vector) was discussed in Chapter 3. Displacement (vector) is defined as the Distance together with Direction (geometry) of the straight line joining final point to an initial point. Remember that Displacement (vector) is just one example of Euclidean vector We could just as well have decided to use Force or Velocity to illustrate the properties of Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.6.1|Adding Vectors|215
When Euclidean vector are added we need to add both magnitude and Direction (geometry) For example take steps in the forward Direction (geometry) stop and then take another steps in the forward Direction (geometry) The first steps is Displacement (vector) Euclidean vector and the second steps is also Displacement (vector) Euclidean vector If we did not stop after the first steps we would have taken steps in the forward Direction (geometry) in total. Therefore if we add the Displacement (vector) Euclidean vector for steps and steps we should get total of steps in the forward Direction (geometry) Graphically this can be seen by first following the first Euclidean vector two steps forward and then following the second one three steps forward: We add the second Euclidean vector at the end of the first Euclidean vector since this is where we now are after the first Euclidean vector has acted. The Euclidean vector from the tail of the first Euclidean vector (the starting point) to the head of the last (the end point) is then the sum of the Euclidean vector This is the head-to-tail method of Euclidean vector addition. As you can convince yourself the order in which you add Euclidean vector does not matter. In the example above if you decided to first go steps forward and then another steps forward the end result would still be steps forward. The final answer when adding Euclidean vector is called the resultant. The resultant Displacement (vector) in this case will be steps forward. Definition: Resultant of Euclidean vector The resultant of number of Euclidean vector is the single Euclidean vector whose effect is the same as the individual Euclidean vector acting together. In other words the individual Euclidean vector can be replaced by the resultant the overall effect is the same. If Euclidean vector and have resultant this can be represented mathematically as Let us consider some more examples of Euclidean vector addition using Displacement (vector) The arrows tell you how far to move and in what Direction (geometry) Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward while arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the examples below and check them. This example says step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice as long two steps forward. This examples says step backward and then another step backward is the same as an arrow twice as long two steps backward. It is sometimes possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of what you have done is that you have gone nowhere (your start and end points are at the same place). In this case your resultant Displacement (vector) is Euclidean vector with Length zero units. We use the symbol to denote such Euclidean vector It is important to realise that the Direction (geometry) are not special forward and backwards or left and right are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel Direction (geometry) In the above examples the separate Displacement (vector) were parallel to one another. However the same head-to-tail technique of Euclidean vector addition can be applied to Euclidean vector in any Direction (geometry) Now you have discovered one use for Euclidean vector describing resultant Displacement (vector) how far and in what Direction (geometry) you have travelled after series of movements. Although Euclidean vector addition here has been demonstrated with Displacement (vector) all Euclidean vector behave in exactly the same way. Thus if given number of Force acting on body you can use the same method to determine the resultant Force acting on the body. We will return to Euclidean vector addition in more detail later. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.6.2|Subtracting Vectors|217
What does it mean to subtract Euclidean vector Well this is really simple if we have apples and we subtract apples we have only apples left. Now lets Work (physics) in steps if we take steps forward and then subtract steps forward we are left with only two steps forward: What have we done? You originally took steps forward but then you took steps back. That backward Displacement (vector) would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with Length 3. The net result of adding these two Euclidean vector is steps forward: Thus subtracting Euclidean vector from another is the same as adding Euclidean vector in the opposite Direction (geometry) (i.e. subtracting steps forwards is the same as adding steps backwards). Important: Subtracting Euclidean vector from another is the same as adding Euclidean vector in the opposite Direction (geometry) This suggests that in this problem to the right was chosen as the Position (vector) Direction (geometry) Arrows to the right are Position (vector) and arrows to the left are negative. More generally Euclidean vector in opposite Direction (geometry) differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as Position (vector) then Euclidean vector acting down are negative). Thus changing the sign of Euclidean vector simply reverses its Direction (geometry) 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.6.3|Scalar Multiplication|218
What happens when you multiply Euclidean vector by Scalar (mathematics) (an ordinary number)? Going back to normal multiplication we know that is just groups of added together to give 4. We can adopt similar approach to understand how Euclidean vector multiplication Work (physics) 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.7|Techniques of Vector Addition|218
Now that you have learned about the mathematical properties of Euclidean vector we return to Euclidean vector addition in more detail. There are number of techniques of Euclidean vector addition. These techniques fall into two main categories graphical and algebraic techniques. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.7.1|Graphical Techniques|218
Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote individual Euclidean vector and their resultants. We next discuss the two primary graphical techniques the head-to-tail technique and the parallelogram method. The Head-to-Tail Method In describing the mathematical properties of Euclidean vector we used Displacement (vector) and the head-to-tail graphical method of Euclidean vector addition as an illustration. The head-to-tail method of graphically adding Euclidean vector is standard method that must be understood. Method: Head-to-Tail Method of Euclidean vector Addition 1. Choose scale and include reference Direction (geometry) 2. Choose any of the Euclidean vector and draw it as an arrow in the correct Direction (geometry) and of the correct Length remember to put an arrowhead on the end to denote its Direction (geometry) 3. Take the next Euclidean vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the arrowhead of the first Euclidean vector in the correct Direction (geometry) and of the correct Length 4. Continue until you have drawn each Euclidean vector each time starting from the head of the previous Euclidean vector In this way the Euclidean vector to be added are drawn one after the other head- to-tail. 5. The resultant is then the Euclidean vector drawn from the tail of the first Euclidean vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be determined from the Length of its arrow using the scale. Its Direction (geometry) too can be determined from the scale diagram. The Parallelogram Method The parallelogram method is another graphical technique of finding the resultant of two Euclidean vector Method: The Parallelogram Method 1. Choose scale and reference Direction (geometry) 2. Choose either of the Euclidean vector to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct Length in the correct Direction (geometry) 3. Draw the second Euclidean vector as an arrow of the correct Length in the correct Direction (geometry) from the tail of the first Euclidean vector 4. Complete the parallelogram formed by these two Euclidean vector 5. The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. The magnitude can be determined from the Length of its arrow using the scale. The Direction (geometry) too can be determined from the scale diagram. The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two Euclidean vector However it is arguably the most intuitive way of adding two Force acting at point. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.7.2|Algebraic Addition and Subtraction of Vectors|223
Euclidean vector in Straight Line Whenever you are faced with adding Euclidean vector acting in straight line (i.e. some Direction (geometry) left and some right or some acting up and others down) you can use very simple algebraic technique: Method: AdditionSubtraction of Euclidean vector in Straight Line 1. Choose Position (vector) Direction (geometry) As an example for situations involving Displacement (vector) in the Direction (geometry) west and east you might choose west as your Position (vector) Direction (geometry) In that case Displacement (vector) east are negative. 2. Next simply add (or subtract) the Euclidean vector using the appropriate signs. 3. As final step the Direction (geometry) of the resultant should be included in words Position (vector) answers are in the Position (vector) Direction (geometry) while negative resultants are in the negative Direction (geometry) In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to calculate the resultant Displacement (vector) This was possible since the Direction (geometry) of Motion were perpendicular (north and east). Algebraic techniques however are not limited to cases where the Euclidean vector to be combined are along the same straight line or at right angles to one another. The following example illustrates this. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.8|Components of Vectors|228
In the discussion of Euclidean vector addition we saw that number of Euclidean vector acting together can be combined to give single Euclidean vector (the resultant). In much the same way single Euclidean vector can be broken down into number of Euclidean vector which when added give that original Euclidean vector These Euclidean vector which sum to the original are called components of the original Euclidean vector The process of breaking Euclidean vector into its components is called resolving into components. While summing given set of Euclidean vector gives just one answer (the resultant) single Euclidean vector can be resolved into infinitely many sets of components. In the diagrams below the same black Euclidean vector is resolved into different pairs of components. These components are shown as dashed lines. When added together the dashed Euclidean vector give the original black Euclidean vector (i.e. the original Euclidean vector is the resultant of its components). In practice it is most useful to resolve Euclidean vector into components which are at right angles to one another usually horizontal and vertical. Any Euclidean vector can be resolved into horizontal and vertical component. If is Euclidean vector then the horizontal component of is Ax and the vertical component is Ay. 
---------------------------------------------------------

11.8.1|Vector addition using components|231
Components can also be used to find the resultant of Euclidean vector This technique can be applied to both graphical and algebraic methods of finding the resultant. The method is simple: make rough sketch of the problem find the horizontal and vertical components of each Euclidean vector find the sum of all horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components and then use them to find the resultant. Consider the two Euclidean vector and in Figure 11.3 together with their resultant R. Each Euclidean vector in Figure 11.3 can be broken down into component in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. These components are two Euclidean vector which when added give you the original Euclidean vector as the resultant. This is shown in Figure 11.4 where we can see that: In summary addition of the components of the two original Euclidean vector gives the component of the resultant. The same applies to the components. So if we just added all the components together we would get the same answer This is another important property of Euclidean vector 
---------------------------------------------------------

12|Force, Momentum and Impulse|239

---------------------------------------------------------

12.1|Introduction|239
In Grade 10 we studied Motion but not what caused the Motion In this chapter we will learn that net Force is needed to cause Motion We recall what Force is and learn about how Force and Motion are related. We are introduced to two new concepts momentum and impulse and we learn more about turning Force and the Force of Gravity 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.2|Force|239

---------------------------------------------------------

12.2.1|What is a force?|239
Force is anything that can cause change to objects. Force can: change the shape of an object move or stop an object change the Direction (geometry) of moving object. Force can be classified as either contact Force or non-contact Force contact Force must touch or be in contact with an object to cause change. Examples of contact Force are: the Force that is used to push or pull things like on door to open or close it the Force that sculptor uses to turn clay into pot the Force of the wind to turn windmill non-contact Force does not have to touch an object to cause change. Examples of non- contact Force are: the Force due to Gravity like the Earth pulling the Moon towards itself the Force due to electricity like proton and an Electron attracting each other the Force due to Magnet like Magnet pulling paper clip towards itself The unit of Force is the newton (symbol N). This unit is named after Sir Isaac Newton who first defined Force Force is Euclidean vector quantity and has magnitude and Direction (geometry) We use the abbreviation for Force There is popular story that while Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree an apple fell on his head and he suddenly thought of the Universal Newton's law of universal gravitation Coincidently the weight of small apple is approximately N. Force was first described by Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC 212 BC). Archimedes was Greek mathematician astronomer philosopher physicist and engineer. He was killed by Roman soldier during the sack of the city despite orders from the Roman general Marcellus that he was not to be harmed. This chapter will often refer to the resultant Force acting on an object. The resultant Force is simply the Euclidean vector sum of all the Force acting on the object. It is very important to remember that all the Force must be acting on the same object. The resultant Force is the Force that has the same effect as all the other Force added together. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.2.2|Examples of Forces in Physics|240
Most of Physics revolves around Force Although there are many different Force all are handled in the same way. All Force in Physics can be put into one of four groups. These are gravitational Force electromagnetic Force strong nuclear Force and weak nuclear Force You will mostly come across gravitational or electromagnetic Force at school. Gravitational Force Gravity is the attractive Force between two objects due to the Mass of the objects. When you throw ball in the air its Mass and the Earths Mass attract each other which leads to Force between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth and the Earth accelerates towards the ball. The movement of the Earth towards the ball is however so small that you couldnt possibly measure it. Electromagnetic Force Almost all of the Force that we experience in everyday life are electromagnetic in origin. They have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric Force and Magnet Force were different things. After much Work (physics) and experimentation it has been realised that they are actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory. Electric or Electrostatics Force If we have objects carrying Electric charge which are not moving then we are dealing with Electrostatics Force Coulomb Law). This Force is actually much stronger than Gravity This may seem strange since Gravity is obviously very Power (physics) and holding balloon to the wall seems to be the most impressive thing Electrostatics Force have done but if we think about it: for Gravity to be detectable we need to have very large Mass nearby. But balloon rubbed in someones hair can stick to wall with Force so strong that it overcomes the Force of gravitywith just the Electric charge in the balloon and the wall Magnet Force The Magnet Force is different manifestation of the electromagnetic Force It stems from the interaction between moving Electric charge as opposed to the fixed Electric charge involved in Coulomb Law. Examples of the Magnet Force in action include Magnet compassescar engines and computer data storage. Magnet are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them around sites. Friction According to Newtons First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving without Force acting on it will keep on moving. Then why does box sliding on table stop? The answer is Friction Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom of box with the molecules on table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin hence Friction is just another view of the electromagnetic Force Later in this chapter we will discuss Friction Force little more. Drag Force This is the Force an object experiences while travelling through medium like an aeroplane flying through air. When something travels through the air it needs to Displacement (vector) air as it travels and because of this the air exerts Force on the object. This becomes an important Force when you move fast and lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag Force sports car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag Force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag Force then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show the greater the drag Force and hence the slower you hit the ground. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.2.3|Systems and External Forces|241
The concepts of system and an external Force are very important in Physics system is any collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such system then an external Force is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example car pulling two trailers. If we draw box around the two trailers they can be considered closed system or unit. When we look at the Force on this closed system the following Force will apply: The Force of the car pulling the unit (trailer and B) The Force of Friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the Direction (geometry) of Motion The Force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system Gravity The Force of the road pushing upwards on the system These Force are called external Force to the system. The following Force will not apply: The Force of pulling The Force of pulling The Force of Friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the Direction (geometry) of Motion We can also draw box around trailer or in which case the Force will be different. If we consider trailer as system the following external Force will apply: The Force of the car pulling on (towards the right) The Force of pulling on (towards the left) The Force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer Gravity The Force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.2.4|Force Diagrams|242
If we look at the example above and draw Force diagram of all the Force acting on the two-trailer-unit the diagram would look like this: It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw Force diagrams: Make your drawing large and clear. You must use arrows and the Direction (geometry) of the arrow will show the Direction (geometry) of the Force The Length of the arrow will indicate the size of the Force in other words the longer arrows in the diagram (F1 for example) indicates bigger Force than shorter arrow (Ff ). Arrows of the same Length indicate Force of equal size (FN and Fg). Use ?little lines? like in maths to show this. Draw neat lines using ruler. The arrows must touch the system or object. All arrows must have labels. Use letters with key on the side if you do not have enough space on your drawing. The labels must indicate what is applying the Force (the Force of the car?) on what the Force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which Direction (geometry) (to the right) If the values of the Force are known these values can be added to the diagram or key. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.2.5|Free Body Diagrams|243
In free-body diagram the object of interest is drawn as dot and all the Force acting on it are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot. Free body diagram for the two-trailer-system will therefore look like this: 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.2.6|Finding the Resultant Force|244
The easiest way to determine resultant Force is to draw Free body diagram Remember from Chapter ?? that we use the Length of the arrow to indicate the Euclidean vector magnitude and the Direction (geometry) of the arrow to show which Direction (geometry) it acts in. After we have done this we have diagram of Euclidean vector and we simply find the sum of the Euclidean vector to get the resultant Force Figure 12.1: (a) Force diagram of Force acting on box. (b) Free body diagram of the box. For example two people push on box from opposite sides with Force of and respectively as shown in Figure 12.1(a). The Free body diagram in Figure 12.1(b) shows the object represented by dot and the two Force are represented by arrows with their tails on the dot. As you can see the arrows point in opposite Direction (geometry) and have different Length The resultant Force is to the left. This result can be obtained algebraically too since the two Force act along the same line. First as in Motion in one Direction (geometry) choose Frame of reference Secondly add the two Euclidean vector taking their Direction (geometry) into account. For the example assume that the Position (vector) Direction (geometry) is to the right then: FR (+4N) (6N) 2N 2N to the left Remember that negative answer means that the Force acts in the opposite Direction (geometry) to the one that you chose to be Position (vector) You can choose the Position (vector) Direction (geometry) to be any way you want but once you have chosen it you must keep it. As you Work (physics) with more Force diagrams in which the Force exactly balance you may notice that you get zero answer (e.g. N). This simply means that the Force are balanced and that the object will not move. Once Force diagram has been drawn the techniques of Euclidean vector addition introduced in Chapter ?? can be used. Depending on the situation you might choose to use graphical technique such as the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method or else an algebraic approach to determine the resultant. Since Force is Euclidean vector all of these methods apply. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.3|Newton's Laws|246
In grade 10 you learned about Motion but did not look at how things start to move. You have also learned about Force In this section we will look at the effect of Force on objects and how we can make things move. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.3.1|Newton's First Law|247
Sir Isaac Newton was scientist who lived in England (1642-1727). He was interested in the reason why objects move. He suggested that objects that are stationary will remain stationary unless Force acts on them and objects that are moving will keep on moving unless Force slows them down Speed them up or let them change Direction (geometry) From this he formulated what is known as Newtons First Law of Motion Definition: Newtons First Law of Motion An object will remain in state of rest or continue traveling at constant Velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) Force Let us consider the following situations: An ice skater pushes herself away from the side of the ice rink and skates across the ice. She will continue to move in straight line across the ice unless something stops her. Objects are also like that. If we kick soccer ball across soccer Field (physics) according to Newtons First Law the soccer ball should keep on moving forever However in real life this does not happen. Is Newton's laws of motion wrong? Not really. Newtons First Law applies to situations where there arent any external Force present. This means that Friction is not present. In the case of the ice skater the Friction between the skates and the ice is very little and she will continue moving for quite Distance In the case of the soccer ball air Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Friction between the air and the ball) and Friction between the grass and the ball is present and this will slow the ball down. Newtons First Law in action We experience Newtons First Law in every day life. Let us look at the following examples: Rockets: spaceship is launched into space. The Force of the exploding gases pushes the rocket through the air into space. Once it is in space the engines are switched off and it will keep on moving at constant Velocity If the astronauts want to change the Direction (geometry) of the spaceship they need to fire an engine. This will then apply Force on the rocket and it will change its Direction (geometry) Seat belts: We wear seat belts in cars. This is to protect us when the car is involved in an accident. If car is traveling at 120 kmhr1 the passengers in the car is also traveling at 120 kmhr1. When the car suddenly stops Force is exerted on the car (making it slow down) but not on the passengers. The passengers will carry on moving forward at 120 kmhr1according to Newton I. If they are wearing seat belts the seat belts will stop them and therefore prevent them from getting hurt. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.3.2|Newton's Second Law of Motion|249
According to Newton things like to keep on doing what they are doing. In other words if an object is moving it likes to keep on moving and if an object is stationary it likes to stay stationary. So how do objects start to move then? Let us look at the example of 10 Kilogram box on rough table. If we push lightly on the box as indicated in the diagram the box wont move. Lets say we applied Force of 100 yet the box remains stationary. At this point Friction Force of 100 is acting on the box preventing the box from moving. If we increase the Force lets say to 150 and the box just about starts to move the Friction Force is 150 N. To be able to move the box we need to push Hardness enough to overcome the Friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply Force of 200 remembering that Friction Force of 150 is present the first 150 will be used to overcome or cancel the Friction and the other 50 will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate an object we must have resultant Force acting on the block. Now what do you think will happen if we pushed harder lets say 300 N? Or what do you think will happen if the Mass of the block was more say 20 Kilogram or what if it was less? Let us investigate how the Motion of an object is affected by Mass and Force You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is the slower it moved. The acceleration is indirectly proportional to the Mass In mathematical terms: In similar investigation where the Mass is kept constant but the applied Force is varied you will find that the bigger the Force is the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the trolley is therefore directly proportional to the resultant Force In mathematical terms: F. If we rearrange the above equations we get OR ma Newton formulated his second law as follows: Definition: Newtons Second Law of Motion If resultant Force acts on body it will cause the body to accelerate in the Direction (geometry) of the resultant Force The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant Force and indirectly proportional to the Mass of the body. The mathematical representation is m. Applying Newtons Second Law Newtons Second Law can be applied to variety of situations. We will look at the main types of examples that you need to study. Object on an inclined plane When we place an object on slope the Force of Gravity (Fg) acts straight down and not perpendicular to the slope. Due to Gravity pulling straight down the object will tend to slide down the slope with Force equal to the horizontal component of the Force of Gravity (Fg sin ). The object will stick to the slope due to the Friction Force between the object and the surface. As you increase the angle of the slope the horizontal component will also increase until the Friction Force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope. The Force of Gravity will also tend to push an object into the slope. This Force is equal to the vertical component of the Force of Gravity (Fg cos ). There is no movement in this Direction (geometry) as this Force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ?pushing Force is called the normal Force (N) and is equal to the resultant Force in the vertical Direction (geometry) Fg sin in this case but opposite in Direction (geometry) Important: Do not use the abbreviation for weight as it is used to abbreviate Work (physics) Rather use the Force of Gravity Fg for weight. Lifts and rockets So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across surface in other words hori- zontal Motion Here we only considered horizontal Force but we can also lift objects up or let them fall. This is vertical Motion where only vertical Force are being considered. Let us consider 500 Kilogram lift with no passengers hanging on cable. The purpose of the cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go little so that it can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the Motion of the lift. Stage 1: The 500 Kilogram lift is stationary at the second floor of tall building. Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant Force acting on the lift. This means that the upward Force must be balanced by the downward Force The only Force acting down is the Force of Gravity which is equal to (500 98 4900 N) in this case. The cable must therefore pull upwards with Force of 4900 to keep the lift stationary at this point. Stage 2: The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of ms2. If the lift is accelerating it means that there is resultant Force in the Direction (geometry) of the Motion This means that the Force acting upwards is now bigger than the Force of Gravity Fg (down). To find the magnitude of the Force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: (Remember to choose Direction (geometry) as Position (vector) We have chosen upwards as Position (vector) FR ma Fc Fg ma Fc (4900) (500)(1) Fc 5400 upwards The answer makes sense as we need bigger Force upwards to cancel the effect of Gravity as well as make the lift go faster. Stage 3: The lift moves at constant Velocity When the lift moves at constant Velocity it means that all the Force are balanced and that there is no resultant Force The acceleration is zero therefore FR 0. The Force acting upwards is equal to the Force acting downwards therefore Fc 4900 N. Stage 4: The lift slow down at rate of 2ms2. As the lift is now slowing down there is resultant Force downwards. This means that the Force acting downwards is bigger than the Force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the Force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as Position (vector) which means that the acceleration will be negative number. This makes sense as we need smaller Force upwards to ensure resultant Force down. The Force of Gravity is now bigger than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down. Stage 5: The cable snaps. When the cable snaps the Force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only Force that is present would be the Force of Gravity The lift will Free fall and its acceleration can be calculated as follows: Rockets Like with lifts rockets are also examples of objects in vertical Motion The Force of Gravity pulls the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The Force that the engine exerts must overcome the Force of Gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The Work (physics) example below looks at the application of Newtons Second Law in launching rocket. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.3.4|Newton's Third Law of Motion|263
Newtons Third Law of Motion deals with the interaction between pairs of objects. For example if you hold book up against wall you are exerting Force on the book (to keep it there) and the book is exerting Force back at you (to keep you from falling through the book). This may Sound strange but if the book was not pushing back at you your hand will push through the book These two Force (the Force of the hand on the book (F1) and the Force of the book on the hand (F2)) are called an action-reaction pair of Force They have the same magnitude but act in opposite Direction (geometry) and act on different objects (the one Force is onto the book and the other is onto your hand). There is another action-reaction pair of Force present in this situation. The book is pushing against the wall (action Force and the wall is pushing back at the book (reaction). The Force of the book on the wall (F3) and the Force of the wall on the book (F4) are shown in the diagram. Definition: Newtons Third Law of Motion If body exerts Force on body then body exerts Force of equal magnitude on body but in the opposite Direction (geometry) Newtons action-reaction pairs can be found everywhere in life where two objects interact with one another. The following Work (physics) examples will illustrate this: 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.3.6|Different types of forces|268
Tension (physics) Tension (physics) is the magnitude of the Force that exists in objects like ropes chains and struts that are providing support. For example there are Tension (physics) Force in the ropes supporting childs swing hanging from tree. Contact and non-contact Force In this chapter we have come across number of different types of Force for example push or pull Tension (physics) in string Friction Force and the normal. These are all examples of contact Force where there is Physics point of contact between applying the Force and the object. Non-contact Force are Force that act over Distance for example Magnet Force Electrostatics Force and gravitational Force When an object is placed on surface two types of surface Force can be identified. Fric- tion is Force that acts between the surface and the object and parallel to the surface. The normal Force is Force that acts between the object and the surface and parallel to the surface. The normal Force Kilogram box is placed on rough surface and 10 Force is applied at an angle of 369 to the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal Force (N or FN) is the Force between the box and the surface acting in the vertical Direction (geometry) If this Force is not present the box would fall through the surface because the Force of Gravity pulls it downwards. The normal Force therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal Force by considering all the Force in the vertical Direction (geometry) All the Force in the vertical Direction (geometry) must add up to zero because there is no movement in the vertical Direction (geometry) The most interesting and illustrative normal Force question that is often asked has to do with scale in lift. Using Newtons third law we can solve these problems quite easily. When you stand on scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by Gravity There is no acceleration downwards because there is reaction Force we call the normal Force acting upwards on you. This is the Force that the scale would measure. If the gravitational Force were less then the reading on the scale would be less. Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly. We will now move to lift moving at constant Velocity Remember if Velocity is constant then acceleration is zero. In the previous two examples we got exactly the same result because the net acceleration on the man was zero If the lift is accelerating downwards things are slightly different and now we will get more interesting answer Friction Force When the surface of one object slides over the surface of another each body exerts Friction Force on the other. For example if book slides across table the table exerts Friction Force onto the book and the book exerts Friction Force onto the table (Newtons Third Law). Friction Force act parallel to the surfaces. Force is not always big enough to make an object move for example small applied Force might not be able to move heavy crate. The Friction Force opposing the Motion of the crate is equal to the applied Force but acting in the opposite Direction (geometry) This Friction Force is called static Friction When we increase the applied Force (push harder) the Friction Force will also increase until the applied Force overcomes it. This Friction Force can vary from zero (when no other Force are present and the object is stationary) to maximum that depends on the surfaces. When the applied Force is greater than the Friction Force and the crate will move. The Friction Force will now decrease to new constant value which is also dependent on the surfaces. This is called kinetic Friction In both cases the maximum Friction Force is related to the normal Force and can be calculated as follows: For static Friction Ff Where the coefficient of static Friction and normal Force For kinetic Friction Ff Where the coefficient of kinetic Friction and normal Force Remember that static Friction is present when the object is not moving and kinetic Friction while the object is moving. For example when you drive at constant Velocity in car on tar road you have to keep the accelerator pushed in slightly to overcome the kinetic Friction between the tar road and the wheels of the car. The higher the value for the coefficient of Friction the more sticky the surface is and the lower the value the more slippery the surface is. The Friction Force (Ff acts in the horizontal Direction (geometry) and can be calculated in similar way to the normal for as long as there is no movement. If we use the same example as in figure 12.12 and we choose to the right as Position (vector) We often think about Friction in negative way but very often Friction is useful without us realizing it. If there was no Friction and you tried to prop ladder up against wall it would simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use Friction to maintain their grip on cliffs. The brakes of cars would be useless if it wasnt for Friction 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.3.8|Forces in equilibrium|276
At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant Force cause objects to accelerate in straight line. If an object is stationary or moving at constant Velocity then either no Force are acting on the object or the Force acting on that object are exactly balanced. In other words for stationary objects or objects moving with constant Velocity the resultant Force acting on the object is zero. Additionally if there is perpendicular moment of Force then the object will rotate. You will learn more about moments of Force later in this chapter. Therefore in order for an object not to move or to be in equilibrium the sum of the Force (resultant Force must be zero and the sum of the moments of Force must be zero. Definition: Equilibrium An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the Force acting on it and the sum of the moments of the Force equal to zero. If resultant Force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional Force that exactly balances this resultant. Such Force is called the equilibrant and is equal in magnitude but opposite in Direction (geometry) to the original resultant Force acting on the object. Definition: Equilibrant The equilibrant of any number of Force is the single Force required to produce equilibrium and is equal in magnitude but opposite in Direction (geometry) to the resultant Force In the figure the resultant of F1 and F2 is shown. The equilibrant of F1 and F2 is then the Euclidean vector opposite in Direction (geometry) to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. F3). F1 F2 and F3 are in equilibrium F3 is the equilibrant of F1 and F2 F1 and F2 are kept in equilibrium by F3 As an example of an object in equilibrium consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below: Let us draw Free body diagram for the object. In the Free body diagram the object is drawn as dot and all Force acting on the object are drawn in the correct Direction (geometry) starting from that dot. In this case three Force are acting on the object. Each rope exerts Force on the object in the Direction (geometry) of the rope away from the object. These Tension (physics) Force are represented by T1 and T2. Since the object has Mass it is attracted towards the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the Force diagram as Fg. Since the object is stationary the resultant Force acting on the object is zero. In other words the three Force Euclidean vector drawn tail-to-head form closed triangle: 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.4|Forces between Masses|282
In Chapter ?? you saw that Gravitational field exert Force on Mass in the Field (physics) Field (physics) is region of space in which an object experiences Force The Strength of materials of Field (physics) is defined by Field (physics) Strength of materials For example the Gravitational field Strength of materials on or near the surface of the Earth has value that is approximately 98 ms2. The Force exerted by Field (physics) of Strength of materials on an object of Mass is given by: (12.1) This can be re-written in terms of as: This means that can be understood to be measure of Force exerted per unit Mass The Force defined in Equation 12.1 is known as weight. Objects in Gravitational field exert Force on each other without touching. The gravitational Force is an example of non-contact Force Gravity is Force and therefore must be described by Euclidean vector so remember magnitude and Direction (geometry) 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.4.1|Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation|282
Definition: Newton's laws of motion of Universal Gravitation Every point Mass attracts every other point Mass by Force Direction (geometry) along the line connecting the two. This Force is proportional to the product of the Mass and inversely proportional to the square of the Distance between them. The magnitude of the attractive gravitational Force between the two point Mass is given by: where: is the Gravitational constant m1 is the Mass of the first point Mass m2 is the Mass of the second point Mass and is the Distance between the two point Mass Assuming SI units is measured in newtons (N) m1 and m2 in Kilogram Kilogram in Metre (m) and the constant is approximately equal to 6671011N m2 Kilogram Remember that this is Force of attraction. For example consider man of Mass 80 Kilogram standing 10 from woman with Mass of 65 Kilogram As you can see these Force are very small. Now consider the gravitational Force between the Earth and the Moon. The Mass of the Earth is 5981024 Kilogram the Mass of the Moon is 7351022 Kilogram and the Earth and Moon are 038109 apart. The gravitational Force between the Earth and Moon is: From this example you can see that the Force is very large. These two examples demonstrate that the bigger the Mass the greater the Force between them. The 1r2 factor tells us that the Distance between the two bodies plays role as well. The closer two bodies are the stronger the gravitational Force between them is. We feel the gravitational attraction of the Earth most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it but if we were in outer-space we would barely even know the Earths Gravity existed Remember that which means that every object on Earth feels the same gravitational acceleration That means whether you drop pen or book (from the same height) they will both take the same Length of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them at the same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (Equations 12.2 and 12.3). The Force between the Earth (which has the Mass me) and an object of Mass mo is Since it doesnt matter what mo is this tells us that the acceleration on body (due to the Earths Gravity does not depend on the Mass of the body. Thus all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration. The Force on different bodies will be different but the acceleration will be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by Gravity is the same on all objects we label it differently instead of using we use which we call the gravitational acceleration. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.4.2|Comparative Problems|284
Comparative problems involve calculation of something in terms of something else that we know. For example if you weigh 490 on Earth and the gravitational acceleration on Venus is 0903 that of the gravitational acceleration on the Earth then you would weigh 0903 490 4425 on Venus. Principles for answering comparative problems Write out equations and calculate all quantities for the given situation Write out all relationships between variable from first and second case Write out second case Substitute all first case variables into second case Write second case in terms of first case 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5|Momentum and Impulse|287
Momentum is Physical quantity which is closely related to Force Momentum is property which applies to moving objects. Definition: Momentum Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue to move in its Direction (geometry) of travel. Momentum is calculated from the product of the Mass and Velocity of an object. The momentum (symbol p) of an object of Mass moving at Velocity is: According to this equation momentum is related to both the Mass and Velocity of an object. small car travelling at the same Velocity as big truck will have smaller momentum than the truck. The smaller the Mass the smaller the Velocity car travelling at 120 kmhr1will have bigger momentum than the same car travelling at 60 kmhr1. Momentum is also related to Velocity the smaller the Velocity the smaller the momentum. Different objects can also have the same momentum for example car travelling slowly can have the same momentum as motor cycle travelling relatively fast. We can easily demonstrate this. Consider car of Mass 000 Kilogram with Velocity of ms1(about 30 kmhr1). The momentum of the car is therefore Now consider motor cycle of Mass 250 Kilogram travelling at 32 ms1 (about 115 kmhr1). The momentum of the motor cycle is: Even though the motor cycle is considerably lighter than the car the fact that the motor cy- cle is travelling much faster than the car means that the momentum of both vehicles is the same. From the calculations above you are able to derive the unit for momentum as kgms1. Momentum is also Euclidean vector quantity because it is the product of Scalar (mathematics) (m) with Euclidean vector (v). This means that whenever we calculate the momentum of an object we need to include the Direction (geometry) of the momentum. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5.1|Vector Nature of Momentum|290
As we have said momentum is Euclidean vector quantity. Since momentum is Euclidean vector the techniques of Euclidean vector addition discussed in Chapter ?? must be used to calculate the total momentum of system. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5.3|Change in Momentum|291
Let us consider tennis ball Mass 01 g) that is dropped at an initial Velocity of ms1and bounces back at final Velocity of ms1. As the ball approaches the floor it has momentum that we call the momentum before the collision. When it moves away from the floor it has different momentum called the momentum after the collision. The bounce on the floor can be thought of as collision taking place where the floor exerts Force on the tennis ball to change its momentum. The momentum before the bounce can be calculated as follows: Because momentum and Velocity are Euclidean vector we have to choose Direction (geometry) as Position (vector) For this example we choose the initial Direction (geometry) of Motion as Position (vector) in other words downwards is When the tennis ball bounces back it changes Direction (geometry) The final Velocity will thus have negative value. The momentum after the bounce can be calculated as follows: pafter vf Now let us look at what happens to the momentum of the tennis ball. The momentum changes during this bounce. We can calculate the change in momentum as follows: Again we have to choose Direction (geometry) as Position (vector) and we will stick to our initial choice as down- wards is Position (vector) This means that the final momentum will have negative number. You will notice that this number is bigger than the previous momenta calculated. This is should be the case as the ball needed to be stopped and then given momentum to bounce back. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5.5|Newton's Second Law revisited|293
You have learned about Newtons Second Law of Motion earlier in this chapter. Newtons Second Law describes the relationship between the Motion of an object and the net Force on the object. We said that the Motion of an object and therefore its momentum can only change when resultant Force is acting on it. We can therefore say that because net Force causes an object to move it also causes its momentum to change. We can now define Newtons Second Law of Motion in terms of momentum. Definition: Newtons Second Law of Motion (N2) The net or resultant Force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5.6|Impulse|294
Impulse is the product of the net Force and the time interval for which the Force acts. Impulse is defined as: However from Newtons Second Law we know that Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. From this equation we see that for given change in momentum Fnett is fixed. Thus if Fnet is reduced must be in- creased (i.e. smaller resultant Force must be applied for longer to bring about the same change in momentum). Alternatively if is reduced (i.e. the resultant Force is applied for shorter period) then the resultant Force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5.8|Conservation of Momentum|297
In the absence of an external Force acting on system momentum is conserved. Definition: Conservation of Linear Momentum The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant. An isolated system has no Force acting on it from the outside. This means that in an isolated system the total momentum before collision or explosion is equal to the total momentum after the collision or explosion. Consider simple collision of two billiard balls. The balls are rolling on frictionless surface and the system is isolated. So we can apply conservation of momentum. The first ball has Mass m1 and an initial Velocity vi1. The second ball has Mass m2 and moves towards the first ball with an initial Velocity vi2. This situation is shown in Figure 12.14. The total momentum of the system before the collision pi is: After the two balls Collision and move away they each have different momentum. If the first ball has final Velocity of vf1 and the second ball has final Velocity of vf2 then we have the situation shown in Figure 12.15. This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external Force acting on the balls. There- fore by the principle of conservation of linear momentum the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the conservation of momentum in collision of two objects 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.5.9|Physics in Action: Impulse|300
very important application of impulse is improving safety and reducing injuries. In many cases an object needs to be brought to rest from certain initial Velocity This means there is certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can be increased then the Force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage. This is the principle behind arrestor beds for trucks airbags and bending your knees when you jump off chair and land on the ground. Air-Bags in Motor Vehicles Air bags are used in motor vehicles because they are able to reduce the effect of the Force experienced by person during an accident. Air bags extend the time required to stop the momentum of the driver and passenger. During collision the Motion of the driver and passenger carries them towards the windshield which results in large Force exerted over short time in order to stop their momentum. If instead of hitting the windshield the driver and passenger hit an air bag then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results in decrease in the Force Padding as Protection During Sports The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are padded mats in gymnastics. In cricket when the wicket keeper catches the ball the padding is slightly Compression (physics) thus reducing the effect of the Force on the wicket keepers hands. Similarly if gymnast falls the padding Compression (physics) and reduces the effect of the Force on the gymnasts body. Arrestor Beds for Trucks An arrestor bed is patch of ground that is softer than the road. Trucks use these when they have to make an emergency stop. When trucks reaches an arrestor bed the time interval over which the momentum is changed is increased. This decreases the Force and causes the truck to slow down. Follow-Through in Sports In sports where rackets and bats are used like tennis cricket squash badminton and baseball the hitter is often encouraged to follow-through when striking the ball. High Speed films of the collisions between batsrackets and balls have shown that following through increases the time over which the collision between the racketbat and ball occurs. This increase in the time of the collision causes an increase in the Velocity change of the ball. This means that hitter can cause the ball to leave the racketbat faster by following through. In these sports returning the ball with higher Velocity often increases the chances of success. Crumple Zones in Cars Another safety application of trying to reduce the Force experienced is in crumple zones in cars. When two cars have collision two things can happen: 1. the cars bounce off each other or 2. the cars crumple together. Which situation is more dangerous for the occupants of the cars? When cars bounce off each other or rebound there is larger change in momentum and therefore larger impulse. larger impulse means that greater Force is experienced by the occupants of the cars. When cars crumple together there is smaller change in momentum and therefore smaller impulse. The smaller impulse means that the occupants of the cars experience smaller Force Car manufacturers use this idea and design crumple zones into cars such that the car has greater chance of crumpling than rebounding in collision. Also when the car crumples the change in the cars momentum happens over longer time. Both these effects result in smaller Force on the occupants of the car thereby increasing their chances of survival. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.6|Torque and Levers|302

---------------------------------------------------------

12.6.1|Torque|302
This chapter has dealt with Force and how they lead to Motion in straight line. In this section we examine how Force lead to rotational Motion When an object is fixed or supported at one point and Force acts on it Distance away from the support it tends to make the object turn. The moment of Force or Torque (symbol read tau) is defined as the product of the Distance from the support or pivot (r) and the component of Force perpendicular to the object Torque can be seen as rotational Force The unit of Torque is Nm and Torque is Euclidean vector quantity. Some examples of where Torque arises are shown in Figures 12.17 12.18 and 12.19. This shows that there is less Torque when the Force is applied closer to the bolt than further away. Important: Loosening bolt If you are trying to loosen (or tighten) bolt apply the Force on the spanner further away from the bolt as this results in greater Torque to the bolt making it easier to loosen. Important: Any component of Force exerted parallel to an object will not cause the object to turn. Only Tangential and normal components cause turning. Important: Torque The Direction (geometry) of Torque is either clockwise or anticlockwise. When Torque are added choose one Direction (geometry) as Position (vector) and the opposite Direction (geometry) as negative. If equal clockwise and anti- clockwise Torque are applied to an object they will cancel out and there will be no net turning effect. 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.6.2|Mechanical Advantage and Levers|305
We can use our knowlegde about the moments of Force Torque to determine whether situations are balanced. For example two Mass pieces are placed on seesaw as shown in Figure 12.20. The one Mass is Kilogram and the other is Kilogram The Mass are placed Distance and respectively from the pivot. By looking at the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments we can determine whether the seesaw will pivot (move) or not. If the sum of the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments is zero the seesaw is in equilibrium (i.e. balanced). The resultant moment is zero as the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments of Force are in op- Position (vector) Direction (geometry) and therefore cancel each other. As we see in Figure 12.20 we can use different Distance away from pivot to balance two different Force This principle is applied to Lever to make lifting heavy object much easier. Definition: Lever Lever is rigid object that is used with an appropriate Lever or pivot point to multiply the mechanical Force that can be applied to another object. Archimedes reputedly said: Give me Lever long enough and Lever on which to place it and shall move the world. The concept of getting out more than the effort is termed mechanical advantage and is one example of the principle of moments. The Lever allows to do less effort but for greater Distance For instance to lift certain unit of weight with Lever with an effort of half unit we need Distance from the Lever in the efforts side to be twice the Distance of the weights side. It also means that to lift the weight Metre we need to push the Lever for Metre The amount of Work (physics) done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the Lever (in an ideal Lever The Lever only allows to trade effort for Distance Ideally this means that the mechanical advantage of system is the ratio of the Force that performs the Work (physics) (output or load) to the applied Force (input or effort) assuming there is no Friction in the system. In reality the mechanical advantage will be less than the ideal value by an amount determined by the amount of Friction For example you want to raise an object of Mass 100 Kilogram If the pivot is placed as shown in Figure 12.22 what is the mechanical advantage of the Lever In order to calculate mechanical advantage we need to determine the load and effort. Important: Effort is the input Force and load is the output Force 
---------------------------------------------------------

12.6.3|Classes of levers|307
Class Lever In class Lever the Lever is between the effort and the load. Examples of class Lever are the seesaw crowbar and equal-arm balance. The mechanical advantage of class Lever can be increased by moving the Lever closer to the load. Class Lever In class Lever the Lever is at the one end of the bar with the load closer to the Lever and the effort on the other end of bar. The mechanical advantage of this type of Lever can be increased by increasing the Length of the bar. bottle opener or wheel barrow are examples of class Lever Class Lever In class Lever the Lever is also at the end of the bar but the effort is between the Lever and the load. An example of this type of Lever is the human arm.

13|Geometrical Optics|327

---------------------------------------------------------

13.1|Introduction|327
In Grade 10 we studied how Light is Reflection (physics) and Refraction This chapter builds on what you have learnt in Grade 10. You will learn about lenses how the human eye Work (physics) as well as how Telescope and Optical microscope Work (physics) 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.2|Lenses|327
In this section we will discuss properties of thin lenses. In Grade 10 you learnt about two kinds of mirrors: Curved mirror which were also known as converging mirrors and Curved mirror which were also known as diverging mirrors. Similarly there are two types of lenses: converging and diverging lenses. We have learnt how Light travels in different materials and we are now ready to learn how we can control the Direction (geometry) of Light Ray (optics) We use lenses to control the Direction (geometry) of Light When Light enters lens the Light Ray (optics) bend or change Direction (geometry) as shown in Figure 13.1. Definition: Lens lens is any transparent material (e.g. glass) of an appropriate shape that can take parallel Ray (optics) of incident Light and either converge the Ray (optics) to point or diverge the Ray (optics) from point. Some lenses will focus Light Ray (optics) to single point. These lenses are called converging or concave lenses. Other lenses spread out the Light Ray (optics) so that it looks like they all come from the same point. These lenses are called diverging or convex lenses. Lenses change the Direction (geometry) of Light Ray (optics) by Refraction They are designed so that the image appears in certain place or as certain size. Lenses are used in eyeglasses cameras Optical microscope and Telescope You also have lenses in your eyes Definition: Converging Lenses Converging lenses converge parallel Ray (optics) of Light and are thicker in the middle than at the edges. Definition: Diverging Lenses Diverging lenses diverge parallel Ray (optics) of Light and are thicker at the edges than in the middle. parallel Ray (optics) of Light enter the lens Ray (optics) are focused at the same point (a) converging lens will focus the Ray (optics) that enter the lens parallel Ray (optics) of Light enter the lens Ray (optics) are spread out as if they are coming from the same point (b) diverging lens will spread out the Ray (optics) that enter the lens Figure 13.1: The behaviour of parallel Light Ray (optics) entering either converging or diverging lens. Examples of converging and diverging lenses are shown in Figure 13.2. converging lenses diverging lenses Figure 13.2: Types of lenses Before we study lenses in detail there are few important terms that must be defined. Figure 13.3 shows important lens properties: The principal axis is the line which runs horizontally straight through the Geometrical optics centre of the lens. It is also sometimes called the Geometrical optics axis. The Geometrical optics centre (O) of convex lens is usually the centre point of the lens. The Direction (geometry) of all Light Ray (optics) which pass through the Geometrical optics centre remains unchanged. The focus or focal point of the lens is the Position (vector) on the principal axis where all Light Ray (optics) which run parallel to the principal axis through the lens converge (come together) at point. Since Light can pass through the lens either from right to left or left to right there is focal point on each side of the lens (F1 and F2) at the same Distance from the Geometrical optics centre in each Direction (geometry) (Note: the plural form of the word focus is foci.) The focal Length (f) is the Distance between the Geometrical optics centre and the focal point. 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.2.1|Converging Lenses|329
We will only discuss double convex converging lenses as shown in Figure 13.4. Converging lenses are thinner on the outside and thicker on the inside. Figure 13.5 shows convex lens. Light Ray (optics) traveling through convex lens are bent towards the principal axis. For this reason convex lenses are called converging lenses. Figure 13.5: Light Ray (optics) bend towards each other or converge when they travel through convex lens. F1 and F2 are the foci of the lens. The type of images created by convex lens is dependent on the Position (vector) of the object. We will examine the following cases: 1. the object is placed at Distance greater than 2f from the lens 2. the object is placed at Distance equal to 2f from the lens 3. the object is placed at Distance between 2f and from the lens 4. the object is placed at Distance less than from the lens We examine the properties of the image in each of these cases by drawing Ray (optics) diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three Light Ray (optics) through the lens. Any two of these Ray (optics) will show us the location of the image. You can use the third Ray (optics) to check the location. Drawing Ray (optics) Diagrams for Converging Lenses The three Ray (optics) are labelled R1 R2 and R3. The Ray (optics) diagrams that follow will use this naming convention. 1. The first Ray (optics) (R1) travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis. This Ray (optics) is bent by the lens and travels through the focal point. 2. Any Ray (optics) travelling parallel to the principal axis is bent through the focal point. 3. If Light Ray (optics) passes through focal point before it enters the lens then it will leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. The second Ray (optics) (R2) is therefore drawn to pass through the focal point before it enters the lens. 4. Ray (optics) that travels through the centre of the lens does not change Direction (geometry) The third Ray (optics) (R3) is drawn through the centre of the lens. 5. The point where all three of the Ray (optics) (R1 R2 and R3) intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image will form at this point. CASE 1: Object placed at Distance greater than 2f from the lens Figure 13.7: An object is placed at Distance greater than 2f away from the converging lens. Three Ray (optics) are drawn to locate the image which is real smaller than the object and inverted. We can locate the Position (vector) of the image by drawing our three Ray (optics) R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change Direction (geometry) The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at Distance greater than 2f from the lens is upside down or inverted. This is because the Ray (optics) which began at the top of the object above the principal axis after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called Real image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the Light Ray (optics) directly from the image back to the object. The image is also smaller than the object and is located closer to the lens than the object. Important: In reality Light Ray (optics) come from all points along the Length of the object. In Ray (optics) diagrams we only draw three Ray (optics) (all starting at the top of the object) to keep the diagram clear and simple. CASE 2: Object placed at Distance equal to 2f from the lens Figure 13.8: An object is placed at Distance equal to 2f away from the converging lens. Three Ray (optics) are drawn to locate the image which is real the same size as the object and inverted. We can locate the Position (vector) of the image by drawing our three Ray (optics) R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change Direction (geometry) The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at Distance equal to 2f from the lens is upside down or inverted. This is because the Ray (optics) which began at the top of the object above the principal axis after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called Real image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the Light Ray (optics) directly from the image back to the object. The image is the same size as the object and is located at Distance 2f away from the lens. CASE 3: Object placed at Distance between 2f and from the lens Figure 13.9: An object is placed at Distance between 2f and away from the converging lens. Three Ray (optics) are drawn to locate the image which is real larger than the object and inverted. We can locate the Position (vector) of the image by drawing our three Ray (optics) R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change Direction (geometry) The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at Distance between 2f and from the lens is upside down or inverted. This is because the Ray (optics) which began at the top of the object above the principal axis after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called Real image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the Light Ray (optics) directly from the image back to the object. The image is larger than the object and is located at Distance greater than 2f away from the lens. CASE 4: Object placed at Distance less than from the lens Figure 13.10: An object is placed at Distance less than away from the converging lens. Three Ray (optics) are drawn to locate the image which is virtual larger than the object and upright. We can locate the Position (vector) of the image by drawing our three Ray (optics) R1 travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change Direction (geometry) The point where R1 R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all started. The image of an object placed at Distance less than from the lens is upright. The image is called Virtual image because it is on the same side of the lens as the object and you cannot trace all the Light Ray (optics) directly from the image back to the object. The image is larger than the object and is located further away from the lens than the object. Extension: The thin lens equation and Magnification The Thin Lens Equation We can find the Position (vector) of the image of lens mathematically as there is mathematical relation between the object Distance image Distance and focal Length The equation is: where is the focal Length do is the object Distance and di is the image Distance The object Distance do is the Distance from the object to the lens. do is Position (vector) if the object is on the same side of the lens as the Light Ray (optics) enter the lens. This should make sense: we expect the Light Ray (optics) to travel from the object to the lens. The image Distance di is the Distance from the lens to the image. Unlike mirrors which Reflection (physics) Light back lenses Refraction Light through them. We expect to find the image on the same side of the lens as the Light leaves the lens. If this is the case then di is Position (vector) and the image is real (see Figure 13.9). Sometimes the image will be on the same side of the lens as the Light Ray (optics) enter the lens. Then di is negative and the image is virtual (Figure 13.10). If we know any two of the three quantities above then we can use the Thin Lens Equation to solve for the third quantity. Magnification It is possible to calculate the Magnification of an image. The Magnification is how much bigger or smaller the image is than the object. where is the Magnification do is the object Distance and di is the image Distance If di and do are both Position (vector) the Magnification is negative. This means the image is inverted or upside down. If di is negative and do is Position (vector) then the image is not inverted or right side up. If the absolute value of the Magnification is greater than one the image is larger than the object. For example Magnification of -2 means the image is inverted and twice as big as the object. 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.2.2|Diverging Lenses|340
We will only discuss double concave diverging lenses as shown in Figure 13.11. Concave lenses are thicker on the outside and thinner on the inside. Figure 13.12 shows concave lens with Light Ray (optics) travelling through it. You can see that concave lenses have the opposite curvature to convex lenses. This causes Light Ray (optics) passing through concave lens to diverge or be spread out away from the principal axis. For this reason concave lenses are called diverging lenses. Images formed by concave lenses are always virtual. Unlike converging lenses the type of images created by concave lens is not dependent on the Position (vector) of the object. The image is always upright smaller than the object and located closer to the lens than the object. We examine the properties of the image by drawing Ray (optics) diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three Light Ray (optics) through the lens. Any two of these Ray (optics) will show us the location of the image. You can use the third Ray (optics) to check the location but it is not necessary to show it on your diagram. Figure 13.12: Light Ray (optics) bend away from each other or diverge when they travel through concave lens. F1 and F2 are the foci of the lens. Drawing Ray (optics) Diagrams for Diverging Lenses Draw the three Ray (optics) starting at the top of the object. 1. Ray (optics) R1 travels parallel to the principal axis. The Ray (optics) bends and lines up with focal point. However the concave lens is diverging lens so the Ray (optics) must line up with the focal point on the same side of the lens where Light Ray (optics) enter it. This means that we must project an imaginary line backwards through that focal point (F1) (shown by the dashed line extending from R1). 2. Ray (optics) R2 points towards the focal point F2 on the opposite side of the lens. When it hits the lens it is bent parallel to the principal axis. 3. Ray (optics) R3 passes through the Geometrical optics center of the lens. Like for the convex lens this Ray (optics) passes through with its Direction (geometry) unchanged. 4. We find the image by locating the point where the Ray (optics) meet. Since the Ray (optics) diverge they will only meet if projected backward to point on the same side of the lens as the object. This is why concave lenses always have Virtual image (Since the Light Ray (optics) do not actually meet at the image the image cannot be real.) Figure 13.13 shows an object placed at an arbitrary Distance from the diverging lens. We can locate the Position (vector) of the image by drawing our three Ray (optics) for diverging lens. Figure 13.13 shows that the image of an object is upright. The image is called Virtual image because it is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is smaller than the object and is closer to the lens than the object. Figure 13.13: Three Ray (optics) are drawn to locate the image which is virtual smaller than the object and upright.

13.3|The Human Eye|344

---------------------------------------------------------

13.3.1|Structure of the Eye|345
Eyesight begins with lenses. As Light Ray (optics) enter your eye they pass first through the cornea and then through the Crystallinity lens. These form double lens system and focus Light Ray (optics) onto the back wall of the eye called the retina. Rods and cones are nerve cells on the retina that transform Light into electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the Geometrical optics nerve. cross-section of the eye is shown in Figure 13.14. For clear vision the image must be formed right on the retina not in front of or behind it. To accomplish this you may need long or short focal Length depending on the object Distance How do we get the exact right focal Length we need? Remember that the lens system has two parts. The cornea is fixed in place but the Crystallinity lens is Stiffness it can change shape. When the shape of the lens changes its focal Length also changes. You have muscles in your eye called ciliary muscles that control the shape of the Crystallinity lens. When you focus your gaze on something you are squeezing (or relaxing) these muscles. This process of accommodation changes the focal Length of the lens and allows you to see an image clearly. The lens in the eye creates Real image that is smaller than the object and is inverted 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.3.2|Defects of Vision|346
In normal eye the image is focused on the retina. If the muscles in the eye are unable to accommodate adequately the image will not be in focus. This leads to problems with vision. There are three basic conditions that arise: 1. short-sightedness 2. long-sightedness 3. astigmatism Short-sightedness Short-sightedness or myopia is defect of vision which means that the image is focused in front of the retina. Close objects are seen clearly but distant objects appear blurry. This condition can be corrected by placing diverging lens in front of the eye. The diverging lens spreads out Light Ray (optics) before they enter the eye. The situation for short-sightedness and how to correct it is shown in Figure 13.17. Long-sightedness Long-sightedness or hyperopia is defect of vision which means that the image is focused in behind the retina. People with this condition can see distant objects clearly but not close ones. converging lens in front of the eye corrects long-sightedness by converging the Light Ray (optics) slightly before they enter the eye. Reading glasses are an example of converging lens used to correct long-sightedness. Astigmatism Astigmatism is characterised by cornea or lens that is not spherical but is more curved in one plane compared to another. This means that horizontal lines may be focused at different point to vertical lines. Astigmatism is corrected by special lens which has different focal Length in the vertical and horizontal planes. 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.4|Gravitational Lenses|347
Einsteins Theory of General Relativity predicts that Light that passes close to very heavy objects like galaxies black holes and massive stars will be bent. These massive objects therefore act as kind of lens that is known as gravitational lens. Gravitational lenses distort and change the apparent Position (vector) of the image of stars. If heavy object is acting as gravitational lens then an observer from Earth will see many images of distant star (Figure 13.19). 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.5|Telescopes|347
We have seen how simple lens can be used to correct eyesight. Lenses and mirrors are also combined to magnify (or make bigger) objects that are far away. Telescope use combinations of lenses to gather and focus Light However Telescope collect Light from objects that are large but far away like Planet and galaxies. For this reason Telescope are the tools of astronomers. Astronomy is the study of objects outside the Earth like stars Planet galaxies comets and asteroids. Usually the object viewed with Telescope is very far away. There are two types of objects: those with detectable diameter such as the moon and objects that appear as points of Light like stars. There are many kinds of Telescope but we will look at two basic types: Reflection (physics) and Refraction 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.5.1|Refracting Telescopes|347
Refraction Telescope like the one pictured in Figure 13.20 uses two convex lenses to enlarge an image. The Refraction Telescope has large primary lens with long focal Length to gather lot of Light The lenses of Refraction Telescope share focal point. This ensures that parallel Ray (optics) entering the Telescope are again parallel when they reach your eye. 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.5.2|Reflecting Telescopes|348
Some Telescope use mirrors as well as lenses and are called Reflection (physics) Telescope Specifically Reflection (physics) Telescope uses convex lens and two mirrors to make an object appear larger. (Figure 13.21.) Light is collected by the primary mirror which is large and concave. Parallel Ray (optics) traveling toward this mirror are Reflection (physics) and focused to point. The secondary Plane mirror is placed within the focal Length of the primary mirror. This changes the Direction (geometry) of the Light final eyepiece lens diverges the Ray (optics) so that they are parallel when they reach your eye. 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.5.3|Southern African Large Telescope|348
The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is the largest single Geometrical optics Telescope in the southern hemisphere with hexagonal mirror array 11 Metre across. SALT is located in Sutherland in the Northern Cape. SALT is able to record distant stars galaxies and quasars billion times too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. This is equivalent to person being able to see candle flame at on the moon. SALT was completed in 2005 and is truly international initiative because the money to build it came from South Africa the United States Germany Poland the United Kingdom and New Zealand. 
---------------------------------------------------------

13.6|Microscopes|349
We have seen how lenses and mirrors are combined to magnify objects that are far away in Telescope Lenses can also be used to make very small objects bigger. Figure 13.10 shows that when an object is placed at Distance less than from the lens the image formed is virtual upright and is larger than the object. This set-up is simple magnifier. If you want to look at something very small two lenses may Work (physics) better than one. Optical microscope and Telescope often use two lenses to make an image large enough to see. Optical microscope uses two lenses to achieve high Magnification (Figure 13.22). Both lenses are convex or converging. Light from the object first passes through the objective lens. The lens that you look through is called the eyepiece. The focus of the system can be adjusted by changing the Length of the tube between the lenses. Drawing Ray (optics) Diagram for Two-Lens System You already have all the tools to analyze two-lens system. Just consider one lens at time. 1. Use Ray (optics) tracing or the lens equation to find the image for the first lens. 2. Use the image of the first lens as the object of the second lens. 3. To find the Magnification multiply:

14|Longitudinal Waves|355

---------------------------------------------------------

14.1|Introduction|355
In Grade 10 we studied pulses and Wave We looked at transverse Wave more closely. In this chapter we look at another type of Wave called longitudinal Wave In transverse Wave the Motion of the particles in the medium were perpendicular to the Direction (geometry) of the Wave In longitudinal Wave the particles in the medium move parallel (in the same Direction (geometry) as) to the Motion of the Wave Examples of transverse Wave are water Wave or Light Wave An example of longitudinal Wave is Sound Wave 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.2|What is a longitudinal wave?|355
Definition: Longitudinal Wave longitudinal Wave is Wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the Direction (geometry) of propagation of the Wave When we studied transverse Wave we looked at two different Motion the Motion of the particles of the medium and the Motion of the save itself. We will do the same for longitudinal Wave The question is how do we construct such Wave To create transverse Wave we flick the end of for example rope up and down. The particles move up and down and return to their equilibrium Position (vector) The Wave moves from left to right and will be Displacement (vector) longitudinal Wave is seen best in spring that is hung from ceiling. Do the following investigation to find out more about longitudinal Wave From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves in the same Direction (geometry) as the Direction (geometry) in which the spring was pulled. The spring was pulled up and down and the Wave also moved up and down. The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium. The particles in the medium move in the same Direction (geometry) as the Wave The ribbon moves from rest upwards then back to its original Position (vector) then down and then back to its original Position (vector) 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.3|Characteristics of Longitudinal Waves|356
As for transverse Wave the following can be defined for longitudinal Wave Wavelength Amplitude period Frequency and Wave Speed However instead of peaks and Crest (physics) longitudinal Wave have Compression (physics) and Rarefaction Definition: Compression (physics) Compression (physics) is region in longitudinal Wave where the particles are closer together. Definition: Rarefaction Rarefaction is region in longitudinal Wave where the particles are further apart. 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.3.1|Compression and Rarefaction|356
As seen in Figure 14.2 there are regions where the medium is Compression (physics) and other regions where the medium is spread out in longitudinal Wave The region where the medium is Compression (physics) is known as Compression (physics) and the region where the medium is spread out is known as Rarefaction 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.3.2|Wavelength and Amplitude|357
Definition: Wavelength The Wavelength in longitudinal Wave is the Distance between two consecutive points that are in phase. The Wavelength in longitudinal Wave refers to the Distance between two consecutive Compression (physics) or between two consecutive Rarefaction Definition: Amplitude The Amplitude is the maximum Displacement (vector) from Position (vector) of rest. The Amplitude is the Distance from the equilibrium Position (vector) of the medium to Compression (physics) or Rarefaction 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.3.3|Period and Frequency|357
Definition: Period The period of Wave is the time taken by the Wave to move one Wavelength Definition: Frequency The Frequency of Wave is the number of Wavelength per second. The period of longitudinal Wave is the time taken by the Wave to move one Wavelength As for transverse Wave the symbol is used to represent period and period is measured in seconds (s). The Frequency of Wave is the number of Wavelength per second. Using this definition and the fact that the period is the time taken for Wavelength we can define: 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.3.4|Speed of a Longitudinal Wave|358
The Speed of longitudinal Wave is defined as: where Speed in m.s1 Frequency in Hertz Wavelength in 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.4|Graphs of Particle Position, Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration|359
When longitudinal Wave moves through the medium the particles in the medium only move back and forth relative to the Direction (geometry) of Motion of the Wave We can see this in Figure 14.4 which shows the Motion of the particles in medium as longitudinal Wave moves through the medium. Figure 14.4: Position (vector) of particles in medium at different times as longitudinal Wave moves through it. The Wave moves to the right. The dashed line shows the equilibrium Position (vector) of particle 0. Important: particle in the medium only moves back and forth when longitudinal Wave moves through the medium. As in Chapter we can draw graph of the particles Position (vector) as function of time. For the Wave shown in Figure 14.4 we can draw the graph shown in Figure 14.5 for particle 0. The graph for each of the other particles will be identical. Figure 14.5: Graph of particle Displacement (vector) as function of time for the longitudinal Wave shown in Figure 14.4. The graph of the particles Velocity as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the Motion graphs and derivatives The graph of Velocity vs. time for the Motion graphs and derivatives shown in Figure 14.5 is shown is Figure 14.6. The graph of the particles acceleration as function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of the Velocity vs. time graph. The graph of acceleration vs. time for the Motion graphs and derivatives shown in Figure 14.5 is shown is Figure 14.7. 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.5|Sound Waves|360
Sound Wave coming from tuning fork cause the tuning fork to vibrate and push against the air particles in front of it. As the air particles are pushed together Compression (physics) is formed. The particles behind the Compression (physics) move further apart causing Rarefaction As the particles continue to push against each other the Sound Wave travels through the air. Due to this Motion of the particles there is constant variation in the pressure in the air. Sound Wave are therefore pressure Wave This means that in media where the particles are closer together Sound Wave will travel quicker. Sound Wave travel faster through liquids like water than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together). Sound Wave travel faster in solids than in liquids. Figure 14.8: Sound Wave are pressure Wave and need medium through which to travel. Important: Sound Wave is different from Light Wave Sound Wave is produced by an oscillating object while Light Wave is not. Sound Wave cannot be Diffraction while Light Wave can be Diffraction Also because Sound Wave is mechanical Wave (i.e. that it needs medium) it is not capable of traveling through vacuum whereas Light Wave can travel through vacuum. Important: Sound Wave is pressure Wave This means that regions of high pressure Compression (physics) and low pressure Rarefaction are created as the Sound source vibrates. These Compression (physics) and Rarefaction arise because Sound vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal Motion of air produces pressure fluctuations. Sound will be studied in more detail in Chapter 15. 
---------------------------------------------------------

14.6|Seismic Waves|361
Seismic Wave are Wave from vibrations in the Earth (core mantle oceans). Seismic Wave also occur on other Planet for example the moon and can be natural (due to earthquakes volcanic eruptions or meteor strikes) or man-made (due to explosions or anything that hits the earth Hardness Seismic P-waves (P for pressure) are longitudinal Wave which can travel through solid and liquid. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15|Sound|363

---------------------------------------------------------

15.1|Introduction|363
Now that we have studied the basics of longitudinal Wave we are ready to study Sound Wave in detail. Have you ever thought about how amazing your sense of hearing is? It is actually pretty remarkable. There are many types of Sound car horn laughing baby barking dog and somehow your brain can sort it all out. Though it seems complicated it is rather simple to understand once you learn very simple fact. Sound is Wave So you can use everything you know about Wave to explain Sound 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.2|Characteristics of a Sound Wave|363
Since Sound is Wave we can relate the properties of Sound to the properties of Wave The basic properties of Sound are: Pitch (music) loudness and Musical tone Figure 15.1: Pitch (music) and loudness of Sound Sound has lower Pitch (music) (lower Frequency than Sound and is softer (smaller Amplitude than Sound C. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.2.1|Pitch|364
The Frequency of Sound Wave is what your ear understands as Pitch (music) higher Frequency Sound has higher Pitch (music) and lower Frequency Sound has lower Pitch (music) In Figure 15.1 Sound has higher Pitch (music) than Sound B. For instance the chirp of bird would have high Pitch (music) but the roar of lion would have low Pitch (music) The human ear can detect wide range of Frequency Frequency from 20 to 20 000 Hertz are audible to the human ear. Any Sound with Frequency below 20 Hertz is known as an infrasound and any Sound with Frequency above 20 000 Hertz is known as an ultrasound. Table 15.1 lists the ranges of some common animals compared to humans. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.2.2|Loudness|364
The Amplitude of Sound Wave determines its loudness or volume. larger Amplitude means louder Sound and smaller Amplitude means softer Sound In Figure 15.1 Sound is louder than Sound B. The vibration of source sets the Amplitude of Wave It transmits Energy into the medium through its vibration. More energetic vibration corresponds to larger Amplitude The molecules move back and forth more vigorously. The loudness of Sound is also determined by the sensitivity of the ear. The human ear is more sensitive to some Frequency than to others. Loudness thus depends on both the Amplitude of Sound Wave and its Frequency whether it lies in region where the ear is more or less sensitive. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.2.3|Tone|364
Musical tone is measure of the quality of the Sound Wave For example the quality of the Sound produced in particular musical instruments depends on which harmonics are superposed and in which proportions. The harmonics are determined by the Standing wave that are produced in the instrument. Chapter 16 will explain the Physics of music in greater detail. The quality (timbre) of the Sound heard depends on the pattern of the incoming vibrations i.e. the shape of the Sound Wave The more irregular the vibrations the more jagged is the shape of the Sound Wave and the harsher is the Sound heard. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.3|Speed of Sound|365
The Speed of Sound depends on the medium the Sound is travelling in. Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because the density of solids is higher than that of liquids which means that the particles are closer together. Sound can be transmitted more easily. The Speed of Sound also depends on the Temperature of the medium. The hotter the medium is the faster its particles move and therefore the quicker the Sound will travel through the medium. When we heat substance the particles in that substance have more kinetic Energy and vibrate or move faster. Sound can therefore be transmitted more easily and quickly in hotter substances. Sound Wave are pressure Wave The Speed of Sound will therefore be influenced by the pressure of the medium through which it is travelling. At sea level the air pressure is higher than high up on mountain. Sound will travel faster at sea level where the air pressure is higher than it would at places high above sea level. Definition: Speed of Sound The Speed of Sound in air at sea level at Temperature of 21C and under normal atmo- spheric conditions is 344 ms1. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.4|Physics of the Ear and Hearing|365
The human ear is divided into three main sections: the outer middle and inner ear. Lets follow the journey of Sound Wave from the pinna to the auditory nerve which transmits signal to the brain. The pinna is the part of the ear we typically think of when we refer to the ear. Its main function is to collect and focus an incident Sound Wave The Wave then travels through the ear canal until it meets the eardrum. The pressure fluctuations of the Sound Wave make the eardrum vibrate. The three very small bones of the middle ear the malleus (hammer) the incus (anvil) and the stapes (stirrup) transmit the signal through to the elliptical window. The elliptical window is the beginning of the inner ear. From the elliptical window the Sound Wave are transmitted through the liquid in the inner ear and interpreted as Sound by the brain. The inner ear made of the semicircular canals the cochlea and the auditory nerve is filled with fluid. The fluid allows the body to detect quick movements and maintain balance. The snail-shaped cochlea is covered in nerve cells. There are more than 25 000 hairlike nerve cells. Different nerve cells vibrate with different Frequency When nerve cell vibrates it releases electrical impulses to the auditory nerve. The impulses are sent to the brain through the auditory nerve and understood as Sound 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.4.1|Intensity of Sound|366
Intensity is one indicator of Amplitude Intensity is the Energy transmitted over unit of area each second. Extension: Intensity Intensity is defined as: Intensity Energy time area Power (physics) area By the definition of intensity we can see that the units of intensity are Joule m2 Watts m2 The unit of intensity is the decibel (symbol: dB). This reduces to an SI equivalent of m2. The threshold of hearing is 1012 m2. Below this intensity the Sound is too soft for the ear to hear. The threshold of pain is 1.0 m2. Above this intensity Sound is so loud it becomes uncomfortable for the ear. Notice that there is factor of 1012 between the thresholds of hearing and pain. This is one reason we define the decibel (dB) scale. Extension: dB Scale The intensity in dB of Sound of intensity is given by: 10 log Io Io 1012 m2 (15.1) In this way we can Compression (physics) the whole hearing intensity scale into range from dB to 120 dB. Notice that there are Sound which exceed the threshold of pain. Exposure to these Sound can cause immediate damage to hearing. In fact exposure to Sound from 80 dB and above can damage hearing over time. Measures can be taken to avoid damage such as wearing earplugs or ear muffs. Limiting exposure time and increasing Distance between you and the source are also important steps to protecting your hearing. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.5|Ultrasound|367
Ultrasound is Sound with Frequency that is higher than 20 kHz. Some animals such as dogs dolphins and bats have an upper limit that is greater than that of the human ear and can hear ultrasound. The most common use of ultrasound is to create images and has industrial and medical applications. The use of ultrasound to create images is based on the Reflection (physics) and transmission of Wave at boundary. When an ultrasound Wave travels inside an object that is made up of different materials such as the human body each time it encounters boundary e.g. between bone and muscle or muscle and fat part of the Wave is Reflection (physics) and part of it is transmitted. The Reflection (physics) Ray (optics) are detected and used to construct an image of the object. Ultrasound in medicine can visualise muscle and soft tissue making them useful for scanning the organs and is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is safe non-invasive method of looking inside the human body. Ultrasound sources may be used to generate local heating in biological tissue with applications in Physics therapy and cancer treatment. Focussed ultrasound sources may be used to break up kidney stones. Ultrasonic cleaners sometimes called supersonic cleaners are used at Frequency from 20-40 kHz for jewellery lenses and other Geometrical optics parts watches dental instruments surgical instruments and industrial parts. These cleaners consist of containers with fluid in which the object to be cleaned is placed. Ultrasonic Wave are then sent into the fluid. The main mechanism for cleaning action in an ultrasonic cleaner is actually the Energy released from the collapse of millions of Optical microscope bubbles occurring in the liquid of the cleaner. Ultrasound generatorspeaker systems are sold with claims that they frighten away rodents and insects but there is no scientific evidence that the devices Work (physics) controlled tests have shown that rodents quickly learn that the speakers are harmless. In echo-sounding the Reflection (physics) from ultrasound pulses that are bounced off objects (for example the bottom of the sea fish etc.) are picked up. The Reflection (physics) are timed and since their Speed is known the Distance to the object can be found. This information can be built into picture of the object that Reflection (physics) the ultrasound pulses. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.6|SONAR|368
Ships on the ocean make use of the Reflection (physics) properties of Sound Wave to determine the depth of the ocean. Sound Wave is transmitted and bounces off the seabed. Because the Speed of Sound is known and the time lapse between sending and receiving the Sound can be measured the Distance from the ship to the bottom of the ocean can be determined This is called sonar which stands from Sound Navigation And Ranging. 
---------------------------------------------------------

15.6.1|Echolocation|368
Animals like dolphins and bats make use of Sound Wave to find their way. Just like ships on the ocean bats use sonar to navigate. Ultrasound Wave that are sent out are Reflection (physics) off the objects around the animal. Bats or dolphins then use the Reflection (physics) Sound to form picture of their surroundings. This is called echolocation.

16|The Physics of Music|373

---------------------------------------------------------

16.1|Introduction|373
What is your favorite musical instrument? How do you play it? Do you pluck string like guitar? Do you blow through it like flute? Do you hit it like drum? All of these Work (physics) by making Standing wave Each instrument has unique Sound because of the special Wave made in it. These Wave could be in the strings of guitar or violin. They could also be in the skin of drum or tube of air in trumpet. These Wave are picked up by the air and later reach your ear as Sound In Grade 10 you learned about Standing wave and boundary conditions. We saw rope that was: fixed at both ends fixed at one end and free at the other We also saw pipe: closed at both ends open at both ends open at one end closed at the other String and wind instruments are good examples of Standing wave on strings and pipes. One way to describe Standing wave is to count nodes. Recall that node is point on string that does not move as the Wave changes. The anti-nodes are the highest and lowest points on the Wave There is node at each end of fixed string. There is also node at the closed end of pipe. But an open end of pipe has an anti-node. What causes Standing wave There are incident and Reflection (physics) Wave traveling back and forth on our string or pipe. For some Frequency these Wave combine in just the right way so that the whole Wave appears to be standing still. These special cases are called harmonic Frequency or harmonics. They depend on the Length and material of the medium. Definition: Harmonic harmonic Frequency is Frequency at which Standing wave can be made. 
---------------------------------------------------------

16.2|Standing Waves in String Instruments|373
Let us look at basic instrument: string pulled tight and fixed at both ends. When you pluck the string you hear certain Pitch (music) This Pitch (music) is made by certain Frequency What causes the string to emit Sound at this Pitch (music) You have learned that the Frequency of Standing wave depends on the Length of the Wave The Wavelength depends on the nodes and anti-nodes. The longest Wave that can fit on the string is shown in Figure 16.1. This is called the fundamental or natural Frequency of the string. The string has nodes at both ends. The Wavelength of the fundamental is twice the Length of the string. Now put your finger on the center of the string. Hold it down gently and pluck it. The Standing wave now has node in the middle of the string. There are three nodes. We can fit whole Wave between the ends of the string. This means the Wavelength is equal to the Length of the string. This Wave is called the first harmonic. As we add more nodes we find the second harmonic third harmonic and so on. We must keep the nodes equally spaced or we will lose our Standing wave You should have found this formula: 2L Here is the number of nodes. is the Length of the string. The Frequency is: Here is the Velocity of the Wave This may seem confusing. The Wave is Standing wave so how can it have Velocity But one Standing wave is made up of many Wave that travel back and forth on the string. Each of these Wave has the same Velocity This Speed depends on the Mass and Tension (physics) of the string. Extension: Guitar Guitars use strings with high Tension (physics) The Length Tension (physics) and Mass of the strings affect the Pitch (music) you hear. High Tension (physics) and short strings make high Frequency Low Tension (physics) and long strings make low Frequency When string is first plucked it vibrates at many Frequency All of these except the harmonics are quickly filtered out. The harmonics make up the Musical tone we hear. The body of guitar acts as large wooden soundboard. Here is how soundboard Work (physics) the body picks up the vibrations of the strings. It then passes these vibrations to the air. Sound hole allows the soundboard of the guitar to vibrate more freely. It also helps Sound Wave to get out of the body. The neck of the guitar has thin metal bumps on it called frets. Pressing string against fret shortens the Length of that string. This raises the natural Frequency and the Pitch (music) of that string. Most guitars use an equal tempered tuning of 12 notes per octave. string guitar has range of octaves with Pitch (music) from 82.407 Hertz (low E) to 2093 kHz (high C). Harmonics may reach over 20 kHz in the inaudible range. Extension: Piano Let us look at another stringed instrument: the piano. The piano has strings that you can not see. When key is pressed felt-tipped hammer hits string inside the piano. The Pitch (music) depends on the Length Tension (physics) and Mass of the string. But there are many more strings than keys on piano. This is because the short and thin strings are not as loud as the long and heavy strings. To make up for this the higher keys have groups of two to four strings each. The soundboard in piano is large cast iron plate. It picks up vibrations from the strings. This heavy plate can withstand over 200 tons of pressure from string Tension (physics) Its Mass also allows the piano to sustain notes for long periods of time. The piano has wide Frequency range from 275 Hertz (low A) to 41860 Hertz (upper C). But these are just the fundamental Frequency piano plays complex rich Musical tone with over 20 harmonics per note. Some of these are out of the range of human hearing. Very low piano notes can be heard mostly because of their higher harmonics. 
---------------------------------------------------------

16.3|Standing Waves in Wind Instruments|377
wind instrument is an instrument that is usually made with pipe or thin tube. Examples of wind instruments are recorders clarinets flutes organs etc. When one plays wind instrument the air that is pushed through the pipe vibrates and Standing wave are formed. Just like with strings the Wavelength of the Standing wave will depend on the Length of the pipe and whether it is open or closed at each end. Lets consider each of the following situations: pipe with both ends open like flute or organ pipe. pipe with one end open and one closed like clarinet. If you blow across small hole in pipe or reed it makes Sound If both ends are open Standing wave will form according to figure 16.2. You will notice that there is an anti-node at each end. In the next activity you will find how this affects the Wavelength The formula is different because there are more anti-nodes than nodes. The right formula is: Here is still the number of nodes. long Wavelength has low Frequency and low Pitch (music) If you took your pipe from the last example and covered one end you should hear much lower note Also the Wavelength of the harmonics for this tube are not integer multiples of each other. Extension: Musical Scale The 12 Musical tone scale popular in Western music took centuries to develop. This scale is also called the 12-note Equal Tempered scale. It has an octave divided into 12 steps. (An octave is the main interval of most scales. If you double Frequency you have raised the note one octave.) All steps have equal ratios of Frequency But this scale is not perfect. If the octaves are in tune all the other intervals are slightly mistuned. No interval is badly out of tune. But none is perfect. For example suppose the base note of scale is Frequency of 110 Hertz low A). The first harmonic is 220 Hertz This note is also an but is one octave higher. The second harmonic is at 330 Hertz (close to an E). The third is 440 Hertz (also an A). But not all the notes have such simple ratios. Middle has Frequency of about 262 Hertz This is not simple multiple of 110 Hertz So the interval between and is little out of tune. Many other types of tuning exist. Just Tempered scales are tuned so that all intervals are simple ratios of Frequency There are also equal tempered scales with more or less notes per octave. Some scales use as many as 31 or 53 notes. 
---------------------------------------------------------

16.4|Resonance|382
Resonance (particle physics) is the tendency of system to vibrate at maximum Amplitude at the natural Frequency of the system. Resonance (particle physics) takes place when system is made to vibrate at its natural Frequency as result of vibrations that are received from another source of the same Frequency In the following investigation you will measure the Speed of Sound using Resonance (particle physics) Interesting fact: Soldiers march out of time on bridges to avoid stimulating the bridge to vibrate at its natural Frequency From the investigation you will notice that the column of air will make Sound at certain Length This is where Resonance (particle physics) takes place. 
---------------------------------------------------------

16.5|Music and Sound Quality|384
In the Sound chapter we referred to the quality of Sound as its Musical tone What makes the Musical tone of note played on an instrument? When you pluck string or vibrate air in tube you hear mostly the fundamental Frequency Higher harmonics are present but are fainter. These are called overtones. The Musical tone of note depends on its mixture of overtones. Different instruments have different mixtures of overtones. This is why the same note Sound different on flute and piano. Let us see how overtones can change the shape of Wave The resultant waveform is very different from the fundamental Frequency Even though the two Wave have the same main Frequency they do not Sound the same 
---------------------------------------------------------

17|Electrostatics|387

---------------------------------------------------------

17.1|Introduction|387
In Grade 10 you learnt about the Force between Electric charge In this chapter you will learn exactly how to determine this Force and about basic law of Electrostatics 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.2|Forces between charges - Coulomb's Law|387
Like Electric charge repel each other while opposite Electric charge attract each other. If the Electric charge are at rest then the Force between them is known as the Electrostatics Force The Electrostatics Force between Electric charge increases when the magnitude of the Electric charge increases or the Distance between the Electric charge decreases. The Electrostatics Force was first studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through his observations he was able to show that the Electrostatics Force between two point-like Electric charge is inversely proportional to the square of the Distance between the objects. He also discovered that the Force is proportional to the product of the Electric charge on the two objects. Q1Q2 r2 where Electric charge is the Electric charge on the one point-like object Electric charge is the Electric charge on the second and is the Distance between the two. The magnitude of the Electrostatics Force between two point-like Electric charge is given by Coulomb Law. Definition: Coulomb Law Coulomb Law states that the magnitude of the Electrostatics Force between two point Electric charge is directly proportional to the magnitudes of each Electric charge and inversely proportional to the square of the Distance between the Electric charge Q1Q2 r2 and the proportionality constant is called the Electrostatics constant and has the value: 899 109N m2 C2. Extension: Similarity of Coulomb Law to the Newtons Universal Newton's law of universal gravitation Notice how similar Coulomb Law is to the form of Newtons Universal Newton's law of universal gravitation between two point-like particles: where m1 and m2 are the Mass of the two particles is the Distance between them and is the Gravitational constant Both laws represent the Force exerted by particles Mass or Electric charge on each other that interact by means of Field (physics) It is very interesting that Coulomb Law has been shown to be correct no matter how small the Distance nor how large the Electric charge For example it still applies inside the atom (over Distance smaller than 1010m). Next is another example that demonstrates the difference in magnitude between the gravitational Force and the Electrostatics Force Important: We can apply Newtons Third Law to Electric charge because two Electric charge exert Force of equal magnitude on one another in opposite Direction (geometry) Important: Coulomb Law When substituting into the Coulomb Law equation it is not necessary to include the signs of the Electric charge Instead select Position (vector) Direction (geometry) Then Force that tend to move the Electric charge in this Direction (geometry) are added while Force that act in the opposite Direction (geometry) are subtracted. We mentioned in Chapter that Electric charge placed on spherical Electrical conductor spreads evenly along the surface. As result if we are far enough from the Electric charge sphere Electrostatics it behaves as point-like Electric charge Thus we can treat spherical Electrical conductor (e.g. metallic balls) as point-like Electric charge with all the Electric charge acting at the centre. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.3|Electric field around charges|392
We have learnt that objects that carry Electric charge feel Force from all other Electric charge objects. It is useful to determine what the effect of Electric charge would be at every point surrounding it. To do this we need some sort of reference. We know that the Force that one Electric charge feels due to another depends on both Electric charge Electric charge and Electric charge How then can we talk about Force if we only have one Electric charge The solution to this dilemma is to introduce test Electric charge We then determine the Force that would be exerted on it if we placed it at certain location. If we do this for every point surrounding Electric charge we know what would happen if we put test Electric charge at any location. This map of what would happen at any point we call an Electric field map. It is map of the Electric field due to Electric charge It tells us how large the Force on test Electric charge would be and in what Direction (geometry) the Force would be. Our map consists of the lines that tell us how the test Electric charge would move if it were placed there. Definition: Electric field An Electric field as region of space in which an Electric charge experiences Force The Direction (geometry) of the Electric field at point is the Direction (geometry) that Position (vector) test Electric charge would move if placed at that point. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.3.1|Electric field lines|393
The maps depend very much on the Electric charge or Electric charge that the map is being made for. We will start off with the simplest possible case. Take single Position (vector) Electric charge with no other Electric charge around it. First we will look at what effects it would have on test Electric charge at number of points. Electric field lines like the Magnet Field (physics) lines that were studied in Grade 10 are way of representing the Electric field at point. Arrows on the Field (physics) lines indicate the Direction (geometry) of the Field (physics) i.e. the Direction (geometry) Position (vector) test Electric charge would move. Electric field lines therefore point away from Position (vector) Electric charge and towards Electric charge Field (physics) lines are drawn closer together where the Field (physics) is stronger. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.3.2|Positive charge acting on a test charge|393
At each point we calculate the Force on test Electric charge and represent this Force by Euclidean vector We can see that at every point the Position (vector) test Electric charge would experience Force pushing it away from the Electric charge Electric charge This is because both Electric charge are Position (vector) and so they repel. Also notice that at points further away the Euclidean vector are shorter. That is because the Force is smaller if you are further away. Electric charge acting on test Electric charge If the Electric charge were negative we would have the following result. Notice that it is almost identical to the Position (vector) Electric charge case. This is important the arrows are the same Length because the magnitude of the Electric charge is the same and so is the magnitude of the test Electric charge Thus the magnitude (size) of the Force is the same. The arrows point in the opposite Direction (geometry) because the Electric charge now have opposite sign and so the test Electric charge is attracted to the Electric charge Now to make things simpler we draw continuous lines showing the path that the test Electric charge would travel. This means we dont have to Work (physics) out the magnitude of the Force at many different points. Some important points to remember about Electric field There is an Electric field at every point in space surrounding Electric charge Field (physics) lines are merely representation they are not real. When we draw them we just pick convenient places to indicate the Field (physics) in space. Field (physics) lines always start at right-angle (90o) to the Electric charge object causing the Field (physics) Field (physics) lines never cross. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.3.3|Combined charge distributions|394
We will now look at the Field (physics) of Position (vector) Electric charge and Electric charge placed next to each other. The net resulting Field (physics) would be the addition of the Field (physics) from each of the Electric charge To start off with let us sketch the Field (physics) maps for each of the Electric charge separately. Notice that test Electric charge starting off directly between the two would be pushed away from the Position (vector) Electric charge and pulled towards the Electric charge in straight line. The path it would follow would be straight line between the Electric charge Now lets consider test Electric charge starting off bit higher than directly between the Electric charge If it starts closer to the Position (vector) Electric charge the Force it feels from the Position (vector) Electric charge is greater but the Electric charge also attracts it so it would move away from the Position (vector) Electric charge with tiny Force attracting it towards the Electric charge As it gets further from the Position (vector) Electric charge the Force from the negative and Position (vector) Electric charge change and they are equal in magnitude at equal Distance from the Electric charge After that point the Electric charge starts to exert stronger Force on the test Electric charge This means that the test Electric charge moves towards the Electric charge with only small Force away from the Position (vector) Electric charge Two like Electric charge both Position (vector) For the case of two Position (vector) Electric charge things look little different. We cant just turn the arrows around the way we did before. In this case the test Electric charge is repelled by both Electric charge This tells us that test Electric charge will never cross half way because the Force of repulsion from both Electric charge will be equal in magnitude. The Field (physics) directly between the Electric charge cancels out in the middle. The Force has equal magnitude and opposite Direction (geometry) Interesting things happen when we look at test Electric charge that are not on line directly between the two. We know that Electric charge the same Distance below the middle will experience Force along Reflection (physics) line because the problem is symmetric (i.e. if we flipped vertically it would look the same). This is also true in the horizontal Direction (geometry) So we use this fact to easily draw in the next four lines. Two like Electric charge both negative We can use the fact that the Direction (geometry) of the Force is reversed for test Electric charge if you change the sign of the Electric charge that is influencing it. If we change to the case where both Electric charge are negative we get the following result: 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.3.4|Parallel plates|397
One very important example of Electric field which is used extensively is the Electric field between two Electric charge parallel plates. In this situation the Electric field is constant. This is used for many practical purposes and later we will explain how Millikan used it to measure the Electric charge on the Electron Field (physics) map for oppositely Electric charge parallel plates This means that the Force that test Electric charge would feel at any point between the plates would be identical in magnitude and Direction (geometry) The Field (physics) on the edges exhibit fringe effects i.e. they bulge outwards. This is because test Electric charge placed here would feel the effects of Electric charge only on one side (either left or right depending on which side it is placed). Test Electric charge placed in the middle experience the effects of Electric charge on both sides so they balance the components in the horizontal Direction (geometry) This is clearly not the case on the edges. Strength of materials of an Electric field When we started making Field (physics) maps we drew arrows to indicate the Strength of materials of the Field (physics) and the Direction (geometry) When we moved to lines you might have asked Did we forget about the Field (physics) Strength of materials We did not. Consider the case for single Position (vector) Electric charge again: Notice that as you move further away from the Electric charge the Field (physics) lines become more spread out. In Field (physics) map diagrams the closer Field (physics) lines are together the stronger the Field (physics) Therefore the Electric field is stronger closer to the Electric charge (the Electric field lines are closer together) and weaker further from the Electric charge (the Electric field lines are further apart). The magnitude of the Electric field at point as the Force per unit Electric charge Therefore and are Euclidean vector From this we see that the Force on Electric charge is simply: The Force between two Electric charge is given by: Qq r2 (if we make the one Electric charge and the other Electric charge Therefore the Electric field can be written as: r2 The Electric field is the Force per unit of Electric charge and hence has units of newtons per Coulomb As with Coulomb law calculations do not substitute the sign of the Electric charge into the equation for Electric field Instead choose Position (vector) Direction (geometry) and then either add or subtract the contribution to the Electric field due to each Electric charge depending upon whether it points in the Position (vector) or negative Direction (geometry) respectively. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.4|Electrical potential energy and potential|400
The Electric potential energy of Electric charge is the Energy it has because of its Position (vector) relative to other Electric charge that it interacts with. The Potential energy of Electric charge Electric charge relative to Electric charge Electric charge Distance away is calculated by: 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.4.1|Electrical potential|400
The Electric potential at point is the Electric potential energy per unit Electric charge i.e. the Potential energy Position (vector) test Electric charge would have if it were placed at that point. Consider Position (vector) test Electric charge Electric charge placed at in the Electric field of another Position (vector) point Electric charge The test Electric charge moves towards under the influence of the Electric field of the other Electric charge In the process the test Electric charge loses Electric potential energy and gains kinetic Energy Thus at the test Electric charge has more Potential energy than at is said to have higher Electric potential than B. The Potential energy of Electric charge at point in Field (physics) is defined as the Work (physics) required to move that Electric charge from infinity to that point. Definition: Voltage The Voltage between two points in an Electric field is defined as the Work (physics) required to move unit Position (vector) test Electric charge from the point of lower potential to that of higher potential. If an amount of Work (physics) is required to move Electric charge from one point to another then the Voltage between the two points is given by unit J.C1 or (the volt) From this equation we can define the volt. Definition: The Volt One volt is the Voltage between two points in an Electric field if one Joule of Work (physics) is done in moving one Coulomb of Electric charge from the one point to the other. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.4.2|Real-world application: lightning|402
Lightning is an atmospheric discharge of electricity usually but not always during rain storm. An understanding of lightning is important for Power (physics) transmission lines as engineers who need to know about lightning in order to adequately protect lines and equipment. Extension: Formation of lightning 1. Electric charge separation The first process in the generation of lightning is Electric charge separation. The mechanism by which Electric charge separation happens is still the subject of research. One theory is that opposite Electric charge are driven apart and Energy is stored in the Electric field between them. Cloud electrification appears to require strong updrafts which carry water droplets upward supercooling them to 10 to 20 oC. These Collision with ice crystals to form soft ice-water mixture called graupel. The collisions result in slight Position (vector) Electric charge being transferred to ice crystals and slight Electric charge to the graupel. Updrafts drive lighter ice crystals upwards causing the cloud top to accumulate increasing Position (vector) Electric charge The heavier Electric charge graupel falls towards the middle and lower portions of the cloud building up an increasing Electric charge Electric charge separation and accumulation continue until the Electric potential becomes sufficient to initiate lightning discharges which occurs when the gathering of Position (vector) and Electric charge forms sufficiently strong Electric field 2. Leader formation As thundercloud moves over the Earths surface an equal but opposite Electric charge is induced in the Earth below and the induced ground Electric charge follows the movement of the cloud. An initial bipolar discharge or path of ionized air starts from Electric charge mixed water and ice region in the thundercloud. The discharge ionized channels are called leaders. The Electric charge leaders called stepped leader proceed generally downward in number of quick jumps each up to 50 Metre long. Along the way the stepped leader may branch into number of paths as it continues to descend. The progression of stepped leaders takes comparatively long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to approach the ground. This initial phase involves relatively small electric Electric current (tens or hundreds of amperes) and the leader is almost invisible compared to the subsequent lightning channel. When step leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite Electric charge on the ground enhances the Electric field The Electric field is highest on trees and tall buildings. If the Electric field is strong enough conductive discharge (called Position (vector) streamer) can develop from these points. As the Field (physics) increases the Position (vector) streamer may evolve into hotter higher Electric current leader which eventually connects to the descending stepped leader from the cloud. It is also possible for many streamers to develop from many different objects simultaneously with only one connecting with the leader and forming the main discharge path. Photographs have been taken on which non-connected streamers are clearly visible. When the two leaders meet the electric Electric current greatly increases. The region of high Electric current propagates back up the Position (vector) stepped leader into the cloud with return stroke that is the most luminous part of the lightning discharge. 3. Discharge When the Electric field becomes strong enough an electrical discharge (the bolt of lightning) occurs within clouds or between clouds and the ground. During the strike successive portions of air become conductive discharge channel as the Electron and Position (vector) ions of air molecules are pulled away from each other and Force to flow in opposite Direction (geometry) The electrical discharge rapidly superheats the discharge channel causing the air to expand rapidly and produce shock Wave heard as thunder. The rolling and gradually dissipating rumble of thunder is caused by the time delay of Sound coming from different portions of long stroke. Important: Estimating Distance of lightning strike The flash of lightning strike and resulting thunder occur at roughly the same time. But Light travels at 300 000 kilometres in second almost million times the Speed of Sound Sound travels at the slower Speed of 330 ms in the same time so the flash of lightning is seen before thunder is heard. By counting the seconds between the flash and the thunder and dividing by you can estimate your Distance from the strike and initially the actual storm cell (in kilometres).

17.5|Capacitance and the parallel plate capacitor|403

---------------------------------------------------------

17.5.1|Capacitors and capacitance|403
parallel plate Capacitor is device that consists of two oppositely Electric charge conducting plates separated by small Distance which stores Electric charge When Voltage is applied to the Capacitor Electric charge of equal magnitude but opposite polarity build up on each plate. Figure 17.1: Capacitor (C) connected in series with resistor (R) and an Energy source (E). Definition: Capacitance Capacitance is the Electric charge stored per volt and is measured in farad (F) Mathematically Capacitance is the ratio of the Electric charge on single plate to the Voltage across the plates of the Capacitor Capacitance is measured in farads (F). Since Capacitance is defined as the units are in terms of Electric charge over Voltage The unit of Electric charge is the Coulomb and the unit of the Voltage is the volt. One farad is therefore the Capacitance if one Coulomb of Electric charge was stored on Capacitor for every volt applied. of Electric charge is very large amount of Electric charge So for small amount of Voltage applied Capacitor can store enormous amount of Electric charge Therefore Capacitor are often denoted in terms of microfarads (1 106) nanofarads (1 109) or picofarads (1 1012). Important: is the magnitude of the Electric charge stored on either plate not on both plates added together. Since one plate stores Position (vector) Electric charge and the other stores Electric charge the total Electric charge on the two plates is zero. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.5.2|Dielectrics|404
The Electric field between the plates of Capacitor is affected by the substance between them. The substance between the plates is called Dielectric Common substances used as Dielectric are mica perspex air paper and glass. When Dielectric is inserted between the plates of parallel plate Capacitor the Dielectric becomes polarised so an Electric field is induced in the Dielectric that opposes the Field (physics) between the plates. When the two Electric field are superposed the new Field (physics) between the plates becomes smaller. Thus the Voltage between the plates decreases so the Capacitance increases. In every Capacitor the Dielectric keeps the Electric charge on one plate from travelling to the other plate. However each Capacitor is different in how much Electric charge it allows to build up on the electrodes per Voltage applied. When scientists started studying Capacitor they discovered the property that the Voltage applied to the Capacitor was proportional to the maximum Electric charge that would accumulate on the electrodes. The constant that made this relation into an equation was called the Capacitance C. The Capacitance was different for different Capacitor But it stayed constant no matter how much Voltage was applied. So it predicts how much Electric charge will be stored on Capacitor when different Voltage are applied. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.5.3|Physical properties of the capacitor and capacitance|404
The Capacitance of Capacitor is proportional to the surface area of the conducting plate and inversely proportional to the Distance between the plates. It is also proportional to the permittivity of the Dielectric The Dielectric is the non-conducting substance that separates the plates. As mentioned before Dielectric can be air paper mica perspex or glass. The Capacitance of parallel-plate Capacitor is given by: where is the permittivity of air is the area of the plates and is the Distance between the plates. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.5.4|Electric field in a capacitor|405
The Electric field Strength of materials between the plates of Capacitor can be calculated using the formula: where is the Electric field in J.C1 is the Voltage in and is the Distance between the plates in m. 
---------------------------------------------------------

17.6|Capacitor as a circuit device|406

17.6.1|A capacitor in a circuit|406
When Capacitor is connected in DC circuit Electric current will flow until the Capacitor is fully Electric charge After that no further Electric current will flow. If the Electric charge Capacitor is connected to another circuit with no source of Electromotive force in it the Capacitor will discharge through the circuit creating Voltage for short time. This is useful for example in camera flash. Initially the electrodes have no net Electric charge Voltage source is applied to Electric charge Capacitor The Voltage source creates an Electric field causing the Electron to move. The Electric charge move around the circuit stopping at the left electrode. Here they are unable to travel across the Dielectric since Electron cannot travel through an Insulator (electricity) The Electric charge begins to accumulate and an Electric field forms pointing from the left electrode to the right electrode. This is the opposite Direction (geometry) of the Electric field created by the Voltage source. When this Electric field is equal to the Electric field created by the Voltage source the Electron stop moving. The Capacitor is then fully Electric charge with Position (vector) Electric charge on the left electrode and Electric charge on the right electrode. If the Voltage is removed the Capacitor will discharge. The Electron begin to move because in the absence of the Voltage source there is now net Electric field This Field (physics) is due to the imbalance of Electric charge on the electrodesthe Field (physics) across the Dielectric Just as the Electron flowed to the Position (vector) electrode when the Capacitor was being Electric charge during discharge the Electron flow to negative electrode. The Electric charge cancel and there is no longer an Electric field across the Dielectric

17.6.2|Real-world applications: capacitors|407
Capacitor are used in many different types of circuitry. In car speakers Capacitor are often used to aid the Power (physics) supply when the speaker require more Power (physics) than the car battery can provide. Capacitor are also used to in processing Electron signals in circuits such as smoothing Voltage spikes due to inconsistent Voltage sources. This is important for protecting sensitive Electron compoments in circuit.

---------------------------------------------------------

18.1|Introduction|413
Electromagnetism is the science of the properties and relationship between electric Electric current and Magnet An electric Electric current creates Magnet Field (physics) and moving Magnet Field (physics) will create flow of Electric charge This relationship between electricity and Magnet has resulted in the invention of many devices which are useful to humans. 
---------------------------------------------------------

18.2|Magnetic field associated with a current|413
If you hold Compass near wire through which Electric current is flowing the needle on the Compass will be deflected. The discovery of the relationship between Magnet and electricity was like so many other scientific discoveries stumbled upon almost by accident. The Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the possibility of electricity and Magnet being related to one another and in the process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front of his whole class. By passing an electric Electric current through metal wire suspended above Magnet Compass Oersted was able to produce definite Motion of the Compass needle in response to the Electric current What began as guess at the start of the class session was confirmed as fact at the end. Needless to say Oersted had to revise his lecture notes for future classes. His discovery paved the way for whole new branch of science electromagnetism. The Magnet Field (physics) produced by an electric Electric current is always oriented perpendicular to the Direction (geometry) of the Electric current flow. When we are drawing Direction (geometry) of Magnet Field (physics) and Electric current we use the symbol and The symbol for an arrow that is coming out of the page and the symbol for an arrow that is going into the page. It is easy to remember the meanings of the symbols if you think of an arrow with head and tail. When the arrow is coming out of the page you see the head of the arrow (). When the arrow is going into the page you see the tail of the arrow (). The Direction (geometry) of the Magnet Field (physics) around the Electric current carrying Electrical conductor is shown in Figure 18.1. Figure 18.1: Magnet Field (physics) around Electrical conductor when you look at the Electrical conductor from one end. (a) Electric current flows into the page and the Magnet Field (physics) is counter clockwise. (b) Electric current flows out of the page and the Magnet Field (physics) is clockwise. 
---------------------------------------------------------

18.2.1|Real-world applications|418
Electromagnets An electromagnet is piece of wire intended to generate Magnet Field (physics) with the passage of electric Electric current through it. Though all current-carrying Electrical conductor produce Magnet Field (physics) an electromagnet is usually constructed in such way as to maximize the Strength of materials of the Magnet Field (physics) it produces for special purpose. Electromagnets find frequent application in research industry medical and consumer products. As an electrically-controllable Magnet electromagnets find application in wide variety of electromechanical devices: machines that effect mechanical Force or Motion through electrical Power (physics) Perhaps the most obvious example of such machine is the electric motor which will be described in detail in Grade 12. Other examples of the use of electromagnets are electric bells relays loudspeakers and scrapyard cranes. 
---------------------------------------------------------

18.3|Current induced by a changing magnetic field|420
While Oersteds surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical applications of electricity it was Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical generation of electricity: electromagnetic induction. Faraday discovered that Voltage was generated across Length of wire while moving Magnet nearby such that the Distance between the two changed. This meant that the wire was exposed to Magnet Field (physics) flux of changing intensity. Furthermore the Voltage also depended on the orientation of the Magnet this is easily understood again in terms of the Magnet flux. The flux will be at its maximum as the Magnet is aligned perpendicular to the wire. The magnitude of the changing flux and the Voltage are linked. In fact if the lines of flux are parallel to the wire there will be no induced Voltage Definition: Faradays Law The Electromotive force produced around loop of Electrical conductor is proportional to the rate of change of the Magnet flux through the area of the loop. This can be stated mathematically as: where and is the Strength of materials of the Magnet Field (physics) Faradays Law relates induced Electromotive force to the rate of change of flux which is the product of the Magnet Field (physics) and the cross-sectional area the Field (physics) lines pass through. When the north pole of Magnet is pushed into solenoid the flux in the solenoid increases so the induced Electric current will have an associated Magnet Field (physics) pointing out of the solenoid (opposite to the Magnet Field (physics) When the north pole is pulled out the flux decreases so the induced Electric current will have an associated Magnet Field (physics) pointing into the solenoid (same Direction (geometry) as the Magnet Field (physics) to try to oppose the change. The Direction (geometry) of Electric current and associated Magnet Field (physics) can all be found using only the Right Hand Rule. When the fingers of the right hand are pointed in the Direction (geometry) of the Electric current the thumb points in the Direction (geometry) of the Magnet Field (physics) When the thumb is pointed in the Direction (geometry) of the Magnet Field (physics) the fingers point in the Direction (geometry) of the Electric current Important: An easy way to create Magnet Field (physics) of changing intensity is to move permanent Magnet next to wire or coil of wire. The Magnet Field (physics) must increase or decrease in intensity perpendicular to the wire (so that the lines of flux cut across the Electrical conductor or else no Voltage will be induced. Important: Finding the Direction (geometry) of the induced Electric current The induced Electric current generates Magnet Field (physics) The induced Magnet Field (physics) is in Direction (geometry) that cancels out the Magnet Field (physics) in which the Electrical conductor is moving. So you can use the Right Hand Rule to find the Direction (geometry) of the induced Electric current by remembering that the induced Magnet Field (physics) is opposite in Direction (geometry) to the Magnet Field (physics) causing the change. Electromganetic induction is put into practical use in the construction of electrical generators which use mechanical Power (physics) to move Magnet Field (physics) past coils of wire to generate Voltage However this is by no means the only practical use for this principle. If we recall that the Magnet Field (physics) produced by current-carrying wire was always perpendicular to that wire and that the flux intensity of that Magnet Field (physics) varied with the amount of Electric current through it we can see that wire is capable of inducing Voltage along its own Length simply due to change in Electric current through it. This effect is called self-induction. Self-induction is when changing Magnet Field (physics) is produced by changes in Electric current through wire inducing Voltage along the Length of that same wire. If the Magnet Field (physics) flux is enhanced by bending the wire into the shape of coil andor wrapping that coil around material of high permeability this effect of self-induced Voltage will be more intense. device constructed to take advantage of this effect is called an inductor and will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. Extension: Lenzs Law The induced Electric current will create Magnet Field (physics) that opposes the change in the Magnet flux.

18.3.1|Real-life applications|422
The following devices use Faradays Law in their operation. induction stoves tape players metal detectors transformers 
---------------------------------------------------------

18.4|Transformers|423
One of the real-world applications of Faradays Law is in transformer. Eskom generates electricity at around 22 000 V. When you plug in toaster the mains Voltage is 220 V. transformer is used to step-down the high Voltage to the lower Voltage that is used as mains Voltage Definition: Transformer transformer is an electrical device that uses the principle of induction between the primary coil and the secondary coil to either step-up or step-down Voltage The essential features of transformer are two coils of wire called the primary coil and the secondary coil which are wound around different sections of the same iron core. When an alternating Voltage is applied to the primary coil it creates an alternating Electric current in that coil which induces an alternating Magnet Field (physics) in the iron core. This changing Magnet Field (physics) induces an Electromotive force which creates Electric current in the secondary coil. The circuit symbol for transformer is: very useful property of transformers is the ability to transform Voltage and Electric current levels according to simple ratio determined by the ratio of input and output coil turns. We can derive mathematical relationship by using Faradays law. Assume that an alternating Voltage Vp is applied to the primary coil (which has Np turns) of transformer. The Electric current that results from this Voltage generates Magnet flux p. We can then describe the Electromotive force in the primary coil by: Vp Np Similarly for the secondary coil Vs Ns If we assume that the primary and secondary windings are perfectly coupled then: which means that: Vp Vs Np Ns transformer designed to output more Voltage than it takes in across the input coil is called step-up transformer. step-up transformer has more windings on the secondary coil than on the primary coil. This means that: Similarly transformer designed to output less than it takes in across the input coil is called step-down transformer. step-down transformer has more windings on the primary coil than on the primary coil. This means that: Np Ns We use step-up transformer to increase the Voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is used at Power (physics) stations to increase the Voltage for the transmission lines. step-down transformer decreases the Voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is particularly used to decrease the Voltage from the transmission lines to Voltage which can be used in factories and in homes. Transformer technology has made long-range electric Power (physics) distribution practical. Without the ability to efficiently step Voltage up and down it would be cost-prohibitive to construct Power (physics) systems for anything but close-range (within few kilometres) use. As useful as transformers are they only Work (physics) with AC not DC. This is because the phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on changing Magnet Field (physics) and Direction (geometry) Electric current (DC) can only produce steady Magnet Field (physics) transformers simply will not Work (physics) with Direction (geometry) Electric current Of course Direction (geometry) Electric current may be interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of transformer to create changing Magnet Field (physics) (as is done in automotive ignition systems to produce high-voltage spark plug Power (physics) from low-voltage DC battery) but pulsed DC is not that different from AC. Perhaps more than any other reason this is why AC finds such widespread application in Power (physics) systems. 
---------------------------------------------------------

18.4.1|Real-world applications|425
Transformers are very important in the supply of electricity nationally. In order to reduce Energy losses due to heating electrical Energy is transported from Power (physics) stations along Power (physics) lines at high Voltage and low Electric current Transformers are used to step the Voltage up from the Power (physics) station to the Power (physics) lines and step it down from the Power (physics) lines to buildings where it is needed. 
---------------------------------------------------------

18.5|Motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field|425
When Electric charge particle moves through Magnet Field (physics) it experiences Force For particle that is moving at right angles to the Magnet Field (physics) the Force is given by: qvB where is the Electric charge on the particle is the Velocity of the particle and is the Magnet Field (physics) through which the particle is moving. Important: The Direction (geometry) of the Force exerted on Electric charge particle moving through Magnet Field (physics) is determined by using the Right Hand Rule. Point your fingers in the Direction (geometry) of the Velocity of the Electric charge and turn them (as if turning screwdriver) towards the Direction (geometry) of the Magnet Field (physics) Your thumb will point in the Direction (geometry) of the Force If the Electric charge is negative the Direction (geometry) of the Force will be opposite to the Direction (geometry) of your thumb.

19|Electric Circuits|429

---------------------------------------------------------

19.1|Introduction|429
The study of electrical circuits is essential to understand the technology that uses electricity in the real-world. This includes electricity being used for the operation of Electron devices like computers. 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.2|Ohm's Law|429

---------------------------------------------------------

19.2.1|Definition of Ohm's Law|429
An important relationship between the Electric current Voltage and Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in circuit was discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and is called Ohm Law. Definition: Ohm Law The amount of electric Electric current through metal Electrical conductor at constant Temperature in circuit is proportional to the Voltage across the Electrical conductor Mathematically Ohm Law is written: I. Ohm Law tells us that if Electrical conductor is at constant Temperature the Voltage across the ends of the Electrical conductor is proportional to the Electric current This means that if we plot Voltage on the y-axis of graph and Electric current on the x-axis of the graph we will get straight-line. The gradient of the straight-line graph is then the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the Electrical conductor 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.2.2|Ohmic and non-ohmic conductors|431
As you have seen there is mention of constant Temperature when we talk about Ohm Law. This is because the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of some Electrical conductor change as their Temperature changes. These types of Electrical conductor are called non-ohmic Electrical conductor because they do not obey Ohm Law. As can be expected the Electrical conductor that obey Ohm Law are called ohmic Electrical conductor Light bulb is common example of non-ohmic Electrical conductor Nichrome wire is an ohmic Electrical conductor In Light bulb the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the filament wire will increase dramatically as it warms from room Temperature to operating Temperature If we increase the supply Voltage in real lamp circuit the resulting increase in Electric current causes the filament to increase in Temperature which increases its Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance This effectively limits the increase in Electric current In this case Voltage and Electric current do not obey Ohm Law. The phenomenon of Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance changing with variations in Temperature is one shared by almost all metals of which most wires are made. For most applications these changes in Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance are small enough to be ignored. In the application of metal lamp filaments which increase lot in Temperature (up to about 1000C and starting from room Temperature the change is quite large. In general non-ohmic Electrical conductor have plots of Voltage against Electric current that are curved indicating that the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is not constant over all values of Voltage and Electric current 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.2.3|Using Ohm's Law|432
We are now ready to see how Ohm Law is used to analyse circuits. Consider the circuit with an ohmic resistor R. If the resistor has Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of and Voltage across the resistor is 5V then we can use Ohm law to calculate the Electric current flowing through the resistor. 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.3|Resistance|433
In Grade 10 you learnt about resistors and were introduced to circuits where resistors were connected in series and circuits where resistors were connected in parallel. In Series and parallel circuits there is one path for the Electric current to flow through. In Series and parallel circuits there are multiple paths for the Electric current to flow through. 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.3.1|Equivalent resistance|433
When there is more than one resistor in circuit we are usually able to replace all resistors with single resistor whose effect is the same as all the resistors put together. The Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the single resistor is known as equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance We are able to calculate equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance for resistors connected in series and parallel. Equivalent Series Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Consider circuit consisting of three resistors and single battery connected in series. The first principle to understand about Series and parallel circuits is that the amount of Electric current is the same through any component in the circuit. This is because there is only one path for Electron to flow in Series and parallel circuits From the way that the battery is connected we can tell which Direction (geometry) the Electric current will flow. We know that Electric charge flows from Position (vector) to negative by convention. Electric current in this circuit will flow in clockwise Direction (geometry) from point to to to and back to A. So how do we use this knowledge to calculate the value of single resistor that can replace the three resistors in the circuit and still have the same Electric current We know that in Series and parallel circuits the Electric current has to be the same in all components. So we can write: I1 I2 I3 We also know that total Voltage of the circuit has to be equal to the sum of the Voltage over all three resistors. So we can write: V1 V2 V3 Finally we know that Ohm Law has to apply for each resistor individually which gives us: V1 I1 R1 V2 I2 R2 V3 I3 R3 Therefore: I1 R1 I2 R2 I3 R3 However because I1 I2 I3 we can further simplify this to: R1 R2 R3 I(R1 R2 R3) Further we can write an Ohm Law relation for the entire circuit: Definition: Equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in Series and parallel circuits Rs For resistors in series the equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is: Rs R1 R2 R3 Rn Let us apply this to the following circuit. Equivalent parallel Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Consider circuit consisting of single battery and three resistors that are connected in parallel. The first principle to understand about Series and parallel circuits is that the Voltage is equal across all components in the circuit. This is because there are only two sets of electrically common points in Series and parallel circuits and Voltage measured between sets of common points must always be the same at any given time. So for the circuit shown the following is true: V1 V2 V3 The second principle for Series and parallel circuits is that all the Electric current through each resistor must add up to the total Electric current in the circuit. I1 I2 I3 Also from applying Ohm Law to the entire circuit we can write: Definition: Equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in Series and parallel circuits Rp For resistors in parallel the equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is: 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.3.2|Use of Ohm's Law in series and parallel Circuits|438

---------------------------------------------------------

19.3.3|Batteries and internal resistance|440
Real batteries are made from materials which have Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance This means that real batteries are not just sources of Voltage Voltage but they also possess internal Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance If the pure Voltage source is referred to as the Electromotive force then real battery can be represented as an Electromotive force connected in series with resistor r. The internal Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the battery is represented by the symbol r. Definition: Load The external Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in the circuit is referred to as the load. Suppose that the battery (or cell) with Electromotive force and internal Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance supplies Electric current through an external load resistor R. Then the Voltage drop across the load resistor is that supplied by the battery: Similarly from Ohm Law the Voltage drop across the internal Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is: Vr The Voltage of the battery is related to its Electromotive force and internal Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance by: Ir or Ir The Electromotive force of battery is essentially constant because it only depends on the chemical reaction (that converts chemical Energy into electrical Energy going on inside the battery. Therefore we can see that the Voltage across the terminals of the battery is dependent on the Electric current drawn by the load. The higher the Electric current the lower the Voltage across the terminals because the Electromotive force is constant. By the same reasoning the Voltage only equals the Electromotive force when the Electric current is very small. The maximum Electric current that can be drawn from battery is limited by critical value Ic. At Electric current of Ic V. Then the equation becomes: 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.4|Series and parallel networks of resistors|442
Now that you know how to handle simple series and Series and parallel circuits you are ready to tackle problems like this: It is relatively easy to Work (physics) out these kind of circuits because you use everything you have already learnt about series and Series and parallel circuits The only difference is that you do it in stages. Figure 19.1: An example of series-parallel network. The dashed boxes indicate parallel sections of the circuit. In Figure 19.1 the circuit consists of parallel portions that are then in series with resistor. So in order to Work (physics) out the equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance you start by reducing the parallel portions to single resistor and then add up all the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in series. If all the resistors in Figure 19.1 had Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of 10 we can calculate the equivalent Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the entire circuit. We start by reducing Series and parallel circuits to single resistor. 
---------------------------------------------------------

19.5|Wheatstone bridge|445
Another method of finding an unknown Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is to use Wheatstone bridge. Wheatstone bridge is measuring instrument that is used to measure an unknown electrical Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance by balancing two legs of bridge circuit one leg of which includes the unknown component. Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer except that in potentiometer circuits the Metre used is sensitive galvanometer. The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843. In the circuit of the Wheatstone bridge Rx is the unknown Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance R1 R2 and R3 are resistors of known Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance and the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of R2 is adjustable. If the ratio of R2:R1 is equal to the ratio of Rx:R3 then the Voltage between the two midpoints will be zero and no Electric current will flow between the midpoints. In order to determine the unknown Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance R2 is varied until this condition is reached. That is when the Voltmeter reads V. Extension: Power (physics) in electric circuits In addition to Voltage and Electric current there is another measure of free Electron activity in circuit: Power (physics) Power (physics) is measure of how rapidly standard amount of Work (physics) is done. In electric circuits Power (physics) is function of both Voltage and Electric current Definition: Electrical Power (physics) Electrical Power (physics) is calculated as: Power (physics) (P) is exactly equal to Electric current (I) multiplied by Voltage (V and there is no extra constant of proportionality. The unit of measurement for Power (physics) is the Watt (abbreviated W). It was James Prescott Joule not Georg Simon Ohm who first discovered the mathematical relationship between Power (physics) dissipation and Electric current through Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance This discovery published in 1841 followed the form of the equation: I2R and is properly known as Joule Law. However these Power (physics) equations are so commonly associated with the Ohm Law equations relating Voltage Electric current and Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance that they are frequently credited to Ohm

20|Electronic Properties of Matter|451

---------------------------------------------------------

20.1|Introduction|451
We can study many different features of solids. Just few of the things we could study are how Hardness or soft they are what are their Magnet properties or how well do they conduct heat. The thing that we are interested in in this chapter are their Electron properties. Simply how well do they conduct electricity and how do they do it. We are only going to discuss materials that form 3-dimensional lattice. This means that the atoms that make up the material have regular pattern (carbon silicon etc.). We wont discuss materials where the atoms are jumbled together in irregular way Plasticity (physics) glass rubber etc.). 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.2|Conduction|451
We know that there are materials that do conduct electricity called Electrical conductor like the copper wires in the circuits you build. There are also materials that do not conduct electricity called Insulator (electricity) like the Plasticity (physics) covering on the copper wires. Electrical conductor come in two major categories: metals (e.g. copper) and semi-conductors (e.g. silicon). Metals conduct very well and semi-conductors dont. One very interesting difference is that metals conduct less as they become hotter but semi-conductors conduct more. What is different about these substances that makes them conduct differently? That is what we are about to find out. We have learnt that Electron in an atom have discrete Energy level When an Electron is given the right amount of Energy it can jump to higher Energy level while if it loses the right amount of Energy it can drop to lower Energy level The lowest Energy level is known as the ground state. When two atoms are far apart from each other they dont influence each other. Look at the picture below. There are two atoms depicted by the black dots. When they are far apart their Electron clouds (the gray clouds) are distinct. The dotted line depicts the Distance of the outermost Electron Energy level that is occupied. In some lattice structures the atoms would be closer together. If they are close enough their Electron clouds and therefore Electron Energy level start to overlap. Look at the picture below. In this picture the two atoms are closer together. The Electron clouds now overlap. The overlapping area is Color in solid gray to make it easier to see. When this happens we might find two Electron with the same Energy and spin in the same space. We know that this is not allowed from the Pauli exclusion principle. Something must change to allow the overlapping to happen. The change is that the Energy of the Energy level change tiny bit so that the Electron are not in exactly the same spin and Energy level at the same time. So if we have atoms then in the overlapping area we will have twice the number of Electron and Energy level but the Energy level from the different atoms will be very very close in Energy If we had atoms then there would be Energy level very close in Energy and so on. In solid there may be very many Energy level that are very close in Energy These groups of Energy level are called bands. The spacing between these bands determines whether the solid is Electrical conductor or an Insulator (electricity) In gas the atoms are spaced far apart and they do not influence each other. However the atoms in solid greatly influence each other. The Force that bind these atoms together in solid affect how the Electron of the atoms behave by causing the individual Energy level of an atom to break up and form Energy bands. The resulting Energy level are more closely spaced than those in the individual atoms. The Energy bands still contain discrete Energy level but there are now many more Energy level than in the single atom. In Crystallinity solids atoms interact with their neighbors and the Energy level of the Electron in isolated atoms turn into bands. Whether material conducts or not is determined by its band structure. Electron follow the Pauli exclusion principle meaning that two Electron cannot occupy the same state. Thus Electron in solid fill up the Energy bands up to certain level (this is called the Fermi Energy Bands which are completely full of Electron cannot conduct electricity because there is no state of nearby Energy to which the Electron can jump. Materials in which all bands are full are Insulator (electricity) 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.2.1|Metals|453
Metals are good Electrical conductor because they have unfilled space in the valence Energy band. In the absence of an Electric field there are Electron traveling in all Direction (geometry) When an Electric field is applied the mobile Electron flow. Electron in this band can be accelerated by the Electric field because there are plenty of nearby unfilled states in the band. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.2.2|Insulator|453
The Energy diagram for the Insulator (electricity) shows the Insulator (electricity) with very wide Energy gap. The wider this gap the greater the amount of Energy required to move the Electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore an Insulator (electricity) requires large amount of Energy to obtain small amount of Electric current The Insulator (electricity) Insulator (electricity) because of the wide forbidden band or Energy gap. Breakdown solid with filled bands is an Insulator (electricity) If we raise the Temperature the Electron gain thermal Energy If there is enough Energy added then Electron can be thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction band. The fraction of Electron excited in this way depends on: the Temperature and the band gap the Energy difference between the two bands. Exciting these Electron into the conduction band leaves behind Position (vector) Electric charge holes in the valence band which can also conduct electricity. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.2.3|Semi-conductors|454
semi-conductor is very similar to an Insulator (electricity) The main difference between semiconductors and Insulator (electricity) is the size of the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. The band gap in Insulator (electricity) is larger than the band gap in semiconductors. In semi-conductors at room Temperature just as in Insulator (electricity) very few Electron gain enough thermal Energy to leap the band gap which is necessary for conduction. For this reason pure semi-conductors and Insulator (electricity) in the absence of applied Field (physics) have roughly similar electrical properties. The smaller band gaps of semi-conductors however allow for many other means besides Temperature to control their electrical properties. The most important one being that for certain amount of applied Voltage more Electric current will flow in the semiconductor than in the Insulator (electricity) 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.3|Intrinsic Properties and Doping|454
We have seen that the size of the Energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band determines whether solid is Electrical conductor or an Insulator (electricity) However we have seen that there is material known as semi-conductor. semi-conductor is solid whose band gap is smaller than that of an Insulator (electricity) and whose electrical properties can be modified by process known as doping. Definition: Doping Doping is the deliberate addition of impurities to pure semiconductor material to change its electrical properties. Semiconductors are often the Group IV elements in the periodic table. The most common semiconductor elements are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The most important property of Group IV elements is that they valence Electron Extension: Band Gaps of Si and Ge Si has band gap of 1.744 1019 while Ge has band gap of 1.152 1019 J. So if we look at the arrangement of for example Si atoms in crystal they would look like that shown in Figure 20.1. The main aim of doping is to make sure there are either too many (surplus) or too few Electron (deficiency). Depending on what situation you want to create you use different elements for the doping. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.3.1|Surplus|455
surplus of Electron is created by adding an element that has more valence Electron than Si to the Si crystal. This is known as n-type doping and elements used for n-type doping usually come from Group in the periodic table. Elements from Group have valence Electron one more than the Group IV elements. common n-type dopant (substance used for doping) is arsenic (As). The combination of semiconductor and an n-type dopant is known as an n-type semiconductor. Si crystal doped with As is shown in Figure 20.2. When As is added to Si crystal the of the valence Electron in As bond with the Si valence Electron The fifth As valence Electron is free to move around. It takes only few As atoms to create enough free Electron to allow an electric Electric current to flow through the silicon. Since n-type dopants donate their free atoms to the semiconductor they are known as donor atoms. Figure 20.2: Si crystal doped with As. For each As atom present in the Si crystal there is one extra Electron This combination of Si and As is known as an n-type semiconductor because of its overall surplus of Electron 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.3.2|Deficiency|455
deficiency of Electron is created by adding an element that has less valence Electron than Si to the Si crystal. This is known as p-type doping and elements used for p-type doping usually come from Group III in the periodic table. Elements from Group III have valence Electron one less than the semiconductor elements that come from Group IV. common p-type dopant is boron (B). The combination of semiconductor and p-type dopant is known as an p-type semiconductor. Si crystal doped with is shown in Figure 20.3. When is mixed into the silicon crystal there is Si valence Electron that is left unbonded. The lack of an Electron is known as hole and has the effect of Position (vector) Electric charge Holes can conduct Electric current hole happily accepts an Electron from neighbor moving the hole over space. Since p-type dopants accept Electron they are known as acceptor atoms. Figure 20.3: Si crystal doped with B. For each atom present in the Si crystal there is one less Electron This combination of Si and is known as p-type semiconductor because of its overall deficiency of Electron Donor (n-type) impurities have extra valence Electron with Energy very close to the conduction band which can be easily thermally excited to the conduction band. Acceptor (p-type) impurities capture Electron from the valence band allowing the easy formation of holes. The Energy level of the donor atom is close to the conduction band and it is relatively easy for Electron to enter the conduction band. The Energy level of the acceptor atom is close to the valence band and it is relatively easy for Electron to leave the valence band and enter the vacancies left by the holes.

20.4|The p-n junction|457

---------------------------------------------------------

20.4.1|Differences between p- and n-type semi-conductors|457
We have seen that the addition of specific elements to semiconductor materials turns them into p-type semiconductors or n-type semiconductors. The differences between n- and p-type semiconductors are summarised in Table ??. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.4.2|The p-n Junction|457
When p-type and n-type semiconductors are placed in contact with each other p-n junction is formed. Near the junction Electron and holes combine to create depletion region. bc depletion band Figure 20.4: The p-n junction forms between p- and n-type semiconductors. The free Electron from the n-type material combine with the holes in the p-type material near the junction. There is small Voltage across the junction. The area near the junction is called the depletion region because there are few holes and few free Electron in this region. Electric Electric current flows more easily across p-n junction in one Direction (geometry) than in the other. If the Position (vector) pole of battery is connected to the p-side of the junction and the negative pole to the n-side Electric charge flows across the junction. If the battery is connected in the opposite Direction (geometry) very little Electric charge can flow. This might not Sound very useful at first but the p-n junction forms the basis for computer chips solar cells and other Electron devices. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.4.3|Unbiased|457
In p-n junction without an external applied Voltage (no bias) an equilibrium condition is reached in which Voltage is formed across the junction. P-type is where you have more holes N-type is where you have more Electron in the material. Initially when you put them together to form junction holes near the junction tends to move across to the N-region while the Electron in the N-region drift across to the p-region to fill some holes. This Electric current will quickly stop as the potential barrier is built up by the migrated Electric charge So in steady state no Electric current flows. Then now when you put Voltage across the terminals you have two cases: forward biased and reverse biased. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.4.4|Forward biased|457
Forward-bias occurs when the p-type semiconductor material is connected to the Position (vector) terminal of battery and the n-type semiconductor material is connected to the negative terminal. The Electric field from the external Voltage can easily overcome the small internal Field (physics) (in the so-called depletion region created by the initial drifting of Electric charge usually anything bigger than 0.6V would be enough. The external Field (physics) then attracts more e- to flow from n-region to p-region and more holes from p-region to n-region and you have forward biased situation. the diode is ON. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.4.5|Reverse biased|458
in this case the external Field (physics) pushes e- back to the n-region while more holes into the p-region as result you get no Electric current flow. Only the small number of thermally released minority carriers (holes in the n-type region and e- in the p-type region) will be able to cross the junction and form very small Electric current but for all practical purposes this can be ignored of course if the reverse biased potential is large enough you get avalanche break down and Electric current flow in the opposite Direction (geometry) In many cases except for Zener diodes you most likely will destroy the diode. 
---------------------------------------------------------

20.4.6|Real-World Applications of Semiconductors|458
Semiconductors form the basis of modern Electron Every electrical appliance usually has some semiconductor-based technology inside it. The fundamental uses of semiconductors are in microchips (also known as integrated circuits) and microprocessors. Integrated circuits are miniaturised circuits. The use of integrated circuits makes it possible for Electron devices (like cellular telephone or hi-fi) to get smaller. Microprocessors are special type of integrated circuit. (NOTE TO SELF: more is needed but Im not that knowledgable and Im tired of Googling...)

21|Motion in Two Dimensions|463

---------------------------------------------------------

21.1|Introduction|463
In Chapter we studied Motion in one dimension and briefly looked at vertical Motion In this chapter we will discuss vertical Motion and also look at Motion in two dimensions. In Chapter 12 we studied the conservation of momentum and looked at applications in one dimension. In this chapter we will look at momentum in two dimensions. 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.2|Vertical Projectile Motion|463
In Chapter we studied the Motion of objects in Free fall and we saw that an object in Free fall falls with gravitational acceleration g. Now we can consider the Motion of objects that are thrown upwards and then fall back to the Earth. We call this Projectile motion and we will only consider the situation where the object is thrown straight upwards and then falls straight downwards this means that there is no horizontal Displacement (vector) of the object only vertical Displacement (vector) 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.2.1|Motion in a Gravitational Field|463
When an object is in Gravitational field it always accelerates downwards with constant acceleration whether the object is moving upward or downward. This is shown in Figure 21.1. Important: Projectiles moving upwards or downwards always accelerate downwards with constant acceleration g. object moving upwards bobject moving downwards Figure 21.1: Objects moving upwards or downwards always accelerate downwards. This means that if an object is moving upwards it decreases until it stops (vf ms1). This is the maximum height that the object reaches because after this the object starts to fall. Important: Projectiles have zero Velocity at their greatest height. Consider an object thrown upwards from vertical height ho. We have seen that the object will travel upwards with decreasing Velocity until it stops at which point it starts falling. The time that it takes for the object to fall down to height ho is the same as the time taken for the object to reach its maximum height from height ho. Figure 21.2: (a) An object is thrown upwards from height h0. (b) After time tm the object reaches its maximum height and starts to fall. (c) After time 2tm the object returns to height h0. Important: Projectiles take the same the time to reach their greatest height from the point of upward launch as the time they take to fall back to the point of launch. 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.2.2|Equations of Motion|464
The Equations of motion that were used in Chapter to describe Free fall can be used for Projectile motion These equations are the same as those equations that were derived in Chapter but with g. We use 98m s2 for our calculations. vi initial Velocity (ms1) at vf final Velocity (ms1) at time height above ground (m) time (s) time interval (s) acceleration due to Gravity (ms2) 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.2.3|Graphs of Vertical Projectile Motion|467
Vertical Projectile motion is similar to Motion at constant acceleration. In Chapter you learned about the graphs for Motion at constant acceleration. The graphs for vertical Projectile motion are therefore identical to the graphs for Motion under constant acceleration. When we draw the graphs for vertical Projectile motion we consider two main situations: an object moving upwards and an object moving downwards. If we take the upwards Direction (geometry) as Position (vector) then for an object moving upwards we get the graphs shown in Figure 21.9. Figure 21.3: Graphs for an object thrown upwards with an initial Velocity vi. The object takes tm to reach its maximum height of hm after which it falls back to the ground. (a) Motion graphs and derivatives (b) Velocity vs. time graph (c) acceleration vs. time graph. 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.3|Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions|475
We have seen in Chapter ?? that the momentum of system is conserved when there are no external Force acting on the system. Conversely an external Force causes change in momentum with the impulse delivered by the Force acting for time given by: The same principles that were studied in applying the conservation of momentum to problems in one dimension can be applied to solving problems in two dimensions. The calculation of momentum is the same in two dimensions as in one dimension. The calculation of momentum in two dimensions is broken down into determining the and components of momentum and applying the conservation of momentum to each set of components. Consider two objects moving towards each other as shown in Figure 21.4. We analyse this situation by calculating the and components of the momentum of each object. Before the collision Total momentum: pi1 m1vi1 pi2 m2vi2 y-component of momentum: pi1y m1vi1y m1vi1 cos pi2y m2vi2y m2vi2 sin After the collision Total momentum: pf1 m1vf1 pf2 m2vf2 x-component of momentum: pf1x m1vf1x m1vf1 cos pf2x m2vf2x m2vf2 sin y-component of momentum: pf1y m1vf1y m1vf1 cos pf2y m2vf2y m2vf2 sin Conservation of momentum The initial momentum is equal to the final momentum: pi pf pi pi1 pi2 pf pf1 pf2 This forms the basis of analysing momentum conservation problems in two dimensions. 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.4|Types of Collisions|480
Two types of collisions are of interest: Elasticity (physics) collisions inelastic collisions In both types of collision total momentum is always conserved. Kinetic Energy is conserved for Elasticity (physics) collisions but not for inelastic collisions. 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.4.1|Elastic Collisions|480
Definition: Elasticity (physics) Collisions An Elasticity (physics) collision is collision where total momentum and total kinetic Energy are both conserved. This means that in an Elasticity (physics) collision the total momentum and the total kinetic Energy before the collision is the same as after the collision. For these kinds of collisions the kinetic Energy is not changed into another type of Energy Before the Collision Figure 21.5 shows two balls rolling toward each other about to Collision Before the balls Collision the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. Ball has momentum which we call pi1 and ball has momentum which we call pi2 it means the total momentum before the collision is: pi pi1 pi2 We calculate the total kinetic Energy of the system in the same way. Ball has kinetic Energy which we call KEi1 and the ball has kinetic Energy which we call KEi2 it means that the total kinetic Energy before the collision is: KEi KEi1 KEi2 After the Collision Figure 21.6 shows two balls after they have Collision After the balls Collision and bounce off each other they have new momenta and new kinetic Energy Like before the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. Ball now has momentum which we call pf1 and ball now has momentum which we call pf2 it means the total momentum after the collision is pf pf1 pf2 Ball now has kinetic Energy which we call KEf1 and ball now has kinetic Energy which we call KEf2 it means that the total kinetic Energy after the collision is: KEf KEf1 KEf2 Since this is an Elasticity (physics) collision the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision and the total kinetic Energy before the collision equals the total kinetic Energy after the collision. Therefore: Initial Final pi pf (21.5) pi1 pi2 pf1 pf2 and KEi KEf (21.6) KEi1 KEi2 KEf1 KEf2 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.4.2|Inelastic Collisions|485
Definition: Inelastic Collisions An inelastic collision is collision in which total momentum is conserved but total kinetic Energy is not conserved. The kinetic Energy is transformed into other kinds of Energy So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the total kinetic Energy before and after the inelastic collision is different. Of course this does not mean that total Energy has not been conserved rather the Energy has been transformed into another type of Energy As rule of thumb inelastic collisions happen when the Collision objects are distorted in some way. Usually they change their shape. The modification of the shape of an object requires Energy and this is where the missing kinetic Energy goes. classic example of an inelastic collision is motor car accident. The cars change shape and there is noticeable change in the kinetic Energy of the cars before and after the collision. This Energy was used to bend the metal and Deformation (engineering) the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in Figure 21.7. An asteroid is moving through space towards the Moon. Before the asteroid crashes into the Moon the total momentum of the system is: pi pim pia The total kinetic Energy of the system is: KEi KEim KEia When the asteroid Collision inelastically with the Moon its kinetic Energy is transformed mostly into heat Energy If this heat Energy is large enough it can cause the asteroid and the area of the Moons surface that it hits to melt into liquid rock From the Force of impact of the asteroid the molten rock flows outwards to form crater on the Moon. After the collision the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since this collision is inelastic (and you can see that change in the shape of objects has taken place) total kinetic Energy is not the same as before the collision. Momentum is conserved: pi pf But the total kinetic Energy of the system is not conserved: Author: Thomas D. Gutierrez Tom Gutierrez received his Bachelor of Science and Master degrees in Physics from San Jose State University in his home town of San Jose California. As Masters student he helped Work (physics) on Laser spectrometer at NASA Ames Research Centre. The instrument measured the ratio of different isotopes of carbon in CO2 gas and could be used for such diverse applications as medical diagnostics and space exploration. Later he received his PhD in Physics from the University of California Davis where he performed calculations for various reactions in high Energy Physics collisions. He Electric current lives in Berkeley California where he studies proton-proton collisions seen at the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island New York. High Energy Collisions Take an orange and expand it to the size of the earth. The atoms of the earth-sized orange would themselves be about the size of regular oranges and would fill the entire earth-orange. Now take an atom and expand it to the size of football Field (physics) The nucleus of that atom would be about the size of tiny seed in the middle of the Field (physics) From this analogy you can see that atomic nuclei are very small objects by human standards. They are roughly 1015 Metre in diameter one-hundred thousand times smaller than typical atom. These nuclei cannot be seen or studied via any conventional means such as the naked eye or Optical microscope So how do scientists study the structure of very small objects like atomic nuclei? The simplest nucleus that of hydrogen is called the proton. Faced with the inability to isolate single proton open it up and directly examine what is inside scientists must resort to brute-force and somewhat indirect means of exploration: high Energy collisions. By Collision protons with other particles (such as other protons or Electron at very high Energy one hopes to learn about what they are made of and how they Work (physics) The American physicist Richard Feynman once compared this process to slamming delicate watches together and figuring out how they Work (physics) by only examining the broken debris. While this analogy may seem pessimistic with sufficient mathematical models and experimental precision considerable information can be extracted from the debris of such high Energy subatomic collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the Force at Work (physics) and also about the sub-structure of such systems. The experiments are in the category of high Energy Physics (also known as subatomic Physics The primary tool of scientific exploration in these experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very very small subatomic objects such as nuclei. As general rule the higher the Energy of the collisions the more detail of the original system you are able to resolve. These experiments are operated at laboratories such as CERN SLAC BNL and Fermilab just to name few. The giant machines that perform the collisions are roughly the size of towns. For example the RHIC Collision at BNL is ring about km in diameter and can be seen from space. The newest machine Electric current being built the LHC at CERN is ring km in diameter

21.5|Frames of Reference|490

---------------------------------------------------------

21.5.1|Introduction|490
Figure 21.8: Top view of road with two people standing on opposite sides. car drives past. Consider two people standing facing each other on either side of road. car drives past them heading West. For the person facing South the car was moving toward the right. However for the person facing North the car was moving toward the left. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the two people used two different Frame of reference from which to investigate this system. If each person were asked in what Direction (geometry) the car were moving they would give different answer. The answer would be relative to their Frame of reference 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.5.2|What is a frame of reference?|491
Definition: Frame of reference Frame of reference is the point of view from which system is observed. In practical terms Frame of reference is set of axes (specifying Direction (geometry) with an origin. An observer can then measure the Position (vector) and Motion of all points in system as well as the orientation of objects in the system relative to the Frame of reference There are two types of reference frames: Inertial frame of reference and non-inertial. An Inertial frame of reference of reference travels at constant Velocity which means that Newtons first law Newton's laws of motion holds true. Non-inertial reference frame such as moving car or rotating carousel accelerates. Therefore Newtons first law does not hold true in Non-inertial reference frame as objects appear to accelerate without the appropriate Force 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.5.3|Why are frames of reference important?|491
Frame of reference are important because (as we have seen in the introductory example) the Velocity of car can differ depending on which Frame of reference is used. Extension: Frame of reference and Special Relativity Frame of reference are especially important in special relativity because when Frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the Speed of Light then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another reference frame. The Speed of Light is considered to be the only true constant between moving Frame of reference The next Work (physics) example will explain this. 
---------------------------------------------------------

21.5.4|Relative Velocity|491
The Velocity of an object is frame dependent. More specifically the perceived Velocity of an object depends on the Velocity of the observer. For example person standing on shore would observe the Velocity of boat to be different than passenger on the boat. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22|Mechanical Properties of Matter|503

---------------------------------------------------------

22.1|Introduction|503
In this chapter we will look at some mechanical Physics properties of various materials that we use. The mechanical properties of material are those properties that are affected by Force being applied to the material. These properties are important to consider when we are constructing buildings structures or modes of transport like an aeroplane. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.2|Deformation of materials|503

---------------------------------------------------------

22.2.1|Hooke's Law|503
Deformation (engineering) (change of shape) of solid is caused by Force that can either be Compression (physics) or Tension (physics) when applied in one Direction (geometry) (plane). Compression (physics) Force try to Compression (physics) the object (make it smaller or more compact) while Tension (physics) Force try to tear it apart. We can study these effects by looking at what happens when you Compression (physics) or expand spring. Hooke's law describes the relationship between the Force applied to spring and its extension. Historical Note: Hooke's law Hooke's law is named after the seventeenth century physicist Robert Hooke who discovered it in 1660 (18 July 1635 March 1703). Definition: Hooke's law In an Elasticity (physics) spring the extension varies linearly with the Force applied. kx where is the Force in newtons (N) is the spring constant in m1 and is the extension in Metre (m). 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.2.2|Deviation from Hooke's Law|506
We know that if you have small spring and you pull it apart too much it stops Work (physics) It bends out of shape and loses its springiness. When this happens Hooke's law no longer applies the springs behaviour deviates from Hooke's law Depending on what type of material we are dealing the manner in which it deviates from Hooke's law is different. We give classify materials by this deviation. The following graphs show the relationship between Force and extension for different materials and they all deviate from Hooke's law Remember that straight line show proportionality so as soon as the graph is no longer straight line Hooke's law no longer applies. Brittle material This graph shows the relationship between Force and extension for brittle but strong material. Note that there is very little extension for large Force but then the material suddenly Fracture Brittleness is the property of material that makes it break easily without bending. Have you ever dropped something made of glass and seen it shatter? Glass does this because of its brittleness. Plasticity (physics) material Here the graph shows the relationship between Force and extension for Plasticity (physics) material. The material extends under small Force but it does not Fracture Ductile material In this graph the relationship between Force and extension is for material that is ductile. The material shows Plasticity (physics) behaviour over range of Force before the material finally Fracture Ductility is the ability of material to be stretched into new shape without breaking. Ductility is one of the characteristic properties of metals. good example of this is aluminium many things are made of aluminium. Aluminium is used for making everything from cooldrink cans to aeroplane parts and even engine blocks for cars. Think about squashing and bending cooldrink can. Brittleness is the opposite of ductility. When material reaches point where Hooke's law is no longer valid we say it has reached its limit of proportionality. After this point the material will not return to its original shape after the Force has been removed. We say it has reached its Elasticity (physics) limit. Definition: Elasticity (physics) limit The Elasticity (physics) limit is the point beyond which permanent Deformation (engineering) takes place. Definition: Limit of proportionality The limit of proportionality is the point beyond which Hooke's law is no longer obeyed. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.3|Elasticity, plasticity, fracture, creep|508

---------------------------------------------------------

22.3.1|Elasticity and plasticity|508
Materials are classified as Plasticity (physics) or Elasticity (physics) depending on how they respond to an applied Force It is important to note that Plasticity (physics) substances are not necessarily type of Plasticity (physics) (polymer) they only behave like Plasticity (physics) Think of them as being like Plasticity (physics) which you will be familiar with. rubber band is material that has Elasticity (physics) It returns to its original shape after an applied Force is removed providing that the material is not stretched beyond its Elasticity (physics) limit. Plasticine is an example of material that is Plasticity (physics) If you flatten ball of plasticine it will stay flat. Plasticity (physics) material does not return to its original shape after an applied Force is removed. Elasticity (physics) materials return to their original shape. Plasticity (physics) materials Deformation (engineering) easily and do not return to their original shape. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.3.2|Fracture, creep and fatigue|508
Some materials are neither Plasticity (physics) nor Elasticity (physics) These substances will break or Fracture when large enough Force is applied to them. The brittle glass we mentioned earlier is an example. Creep (deformation) occurs when material Deformation (engineering) over long period of time because of an applied Force An example of Creep (deformation) is the bending of shelf over time when heavy object is put on it. Creep (deformation) may eventually lead to the material Fracture The application of heat may lead to an increase in Creep (deformation) in material. Fatigue (material) is similar to Creep (deformation) The difference between the two is that Fatigue (material) results from the Force being applied and then removed repeatedly over period of time. With metals this results in failure because of metal Fatigue (material) Fracture is an abrupt breaking of the material. Creep (deformation) is slow Deformation (engineering) process due to continuous Force over long time. Fatigue (material) is weakening of the material due to short Force acting many many times. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.4|Failure and strength of materials|509

---------------------------------------------------------

22.4.1|The properties of matter|509
The Strength of materials of material is defined as the stress (the Force per unit cross-sectional area) that it can withstand. Strength of materials is measured in newtons per square Metre (N m2). Stiffness is measure of how Stiffness material is. In Science we measure the Stiffness of material by calculating its Youngs Modulus. The Youngs modulus is ratio of how much it bends to the load applied to it. Stiffness is measure in newtons per Metre (N m1). Hardness of material can be measured by determining what Force will cause permanent Deformation (engineering) in the material. Hardness can also be measured using scale like Mohs Hardness scale. On this scale diamond is the hardest at 10 and talc is the softest at 1. Remembering that the Mohs scale is the Hardness scale and that the softest substance is talc will often come in handy for general knowledge quizes. The toughness of material is measure of how it can Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance breaking when it is stressed. It is scientifically defined as the amount of Energy that material can absorb before breaking. ductile material is substance that can undergo large Plasticity (physics) Deformation (engineering) without Fracture Many metals are very ductile and they can be drawn into wires e.g. copper silver aluminium and gold. malleable material is substance that can easily undergo Plasticity (physics) Deformation (engineering) by hammering or rolling. Again metals are malleable substances e.g. copper can be hammered into sheets and aluminium can be rolled into aluminium foil. brittle material Fracture with very little or no Plasticity (physics) Deformation (engineering) Glassware and ceramics are brittle. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.4.2|Structure and failure of materials|509
Many substances fail because they have weakness in their atomic structure. There are number of problems that can cause these weaknesses in structure. These are vacancies dislocations grain boundaries and impurities. Vacancies occur when there are spaces in the structure of Crystallinity solid. These vacancies cause weakness and the substance often fail at these places. Think about bricks in wall if you started removing bricks the wall would get weaker. Dislocations occur when there are no strong bonds between two rows in crystal lattice. The crystal will fail along this boundary when sufficient Force is applied. The two pieces of the crystal keep their shape and structure but move along the boundary. Impurities in crystal structure can cause weak spot in the crystal lattice around the impurity. Like vacancies the substance often fail from these places in the lattice. This you can think of as bricks in wall which dont fit properly they are the wrong kind of bricks (atoms) to make the structure strong. difference in grain size in crystal lattice will result in rusting or oxidation at the boundary which again will result in failure when sufficient Force is applied. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.4.3|Controlling the properties of materials|509
There are number of processes that can be used to ensure that materials are less likely to fail. We shall look at few methods in this section. Cold Work (physics) Cold Work (physics) is process in which metal is strengthened by repeatedly being reshaped. This is carried out at Temperature below the melting point of the metal. The repeated shaping of the metal result in dislocations which then prevent further dislocations in the metal. Cold Work (physics) increases the Strength of materials of the metal but in so doing the metal loses its ductility. We say the metal is work-hardened. Annealing Annealing is process in which metal is heated strongly to Temperature that is about half of its melting point. When the metal cools it recrystallises which removes vacancies and dislocations in the metal. Annealing is often used before cold Work (physics) In annealing the metal cools very very slowly. Alloying An alloy is mixture of metal with other substances. The other substances can be metal or non-metal. An alloy often has properties that are very different to the properties of the substances from which it is made. The added substances strengthen the metal by preventing dislocations from spreading. Ordinary steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. There are many types of steel that also include other metals with iron and carbon. Brass is an alloy of copper and Zinc. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Gold and silver that is used in coins or jewellery are also alloyed. Tempering Tempering is process in which metal is melted then quickly cooled. The rapid cooling is called quenching. Usually tempering is done number of times before metal has the correct properties that are needed for particular application. Sintering Sintering is used for making ceramic objects among other things. In this process the substance is heated so that its particles stick together. It is used with substances that have very high melting point. The resulting product is often very pure and it is formed in the process into the shape that is wanted. Unfortunately sintered products are brittle. 
---------------------------------------------------------

22.4.4|Steps of Roman Swordsmithing|510
Purifying the iron ore. Heating the iron blocks in furnace with charcoal. Hammering and getting into the needed shape. The smith used hammer to pound the metal into blade shape. He usually used tongs to hold the iron block in place. Reheating. When the blade cooled the smith reheated it to keep it workable. While reheated and hammered repeatedly. Quenching which involved the process of white heating and cooling in water. Quenching made the blade harder and stronger. At the same time it made the blade quite brittle which was considerable problem for the sword smiths. Tempering was then done to avoid brittleness the blade was tempered. In another words it was reheated final time to very specific Temperature How the Romans do balanced the Temperature The smith was guided only by the blades Color and his own experience.

23|Work, Energy and Power|513

---------------------------------------------------------

23.1|Introduction|513
Imagine vendor carrying basket of vegetables on her head. Is she doing any Work (physics) One would definitely say yes However in Physics she is not doing any Work (physics) Again imagine boy pushing against wall? Is he doing any Work (physics) We can see that his muscles are contracting and expanding. He may even be sweating. But in Physics he is not doing any Work (physics) If the vendor is carrying very heavy load for long Distance we would say she has lot of Energy By this we mean that she has lot of stamina. If car can travel very fast we describe the car as Power (physics) So there is link between Power (physics) and Speed However Power (physics) means something different in Physics This chapter describes the links between Work (physics) Energy and Power (physics) and what these mean in Physics You will learn that Work (physics) and Energy are closely related. You shall see that the Energy of an object is its capacity to do Work (physics) and doing Work (physics) is the process of transferring Energy from one object or form to another. In other words an object with lots of Energy can do lots of Work (physics) when Work (physics) is done Energy is lost by the object doing Work (physics) and gained by the object on which the Work (physics) is done. Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do Work (physics) on them. Even making electricity flow requires that something do Work (physics) Something must have Energy and transfer it through doing Work (physics) to make things happen. 
---------------------------------------------------------

23.2|Work|513
Definition: Work (physics) When Force exerted on an object causes it to move Work (physics) is done on the object (except if the Force and Displacement (vector) are at right angles to each other). This means that in order for Work (physics) to be done an object must be moved Distance by Force such that there is some non-zero component of the Force in the Direction (geometry) of the Displacement (vector) Work (physics) is calculated as: cos where is the applied Force is the Displacement (vector) of the object and is the angle between the applied Force and the Direction (geometry) of Motion Figure 23.1: The Force causes the object to be Displacement (vector) by at angle It is very important to note that for Work (physics) to be done there must be component of the applied Force in the Direction (geometry) of Motion Force perpendicular to the Direction (geometry) of Motion do no Work (physics) For example Work (physics) is done on the object in Figure 23.2 Figure 23.2: (a) The Force causes the object to be Displacement (vector) by in the same Direction (geometry) as the Force 180 and cos 1. Work (physics) is done in this situation. (b) Force is applied to the object. The object is Displacement (vector) by at right angles to the Force 90 and cos 0. Work (physics) is not done in this situation. Important: The Meaning of The angle is the angle between the Force Euclidean vector and the Displacement (vector) Euclidean vector In the following situations 0. As with all Physical quantity Work (physics) must have units. Following from the definition Work (physics) is measured in Nm. The name given to this combination of S.I. units is the Joule (symbol J). Definition: Joule Joule is the Work (physics) done when an object is moved under the application of Force of in the Direction (geometry) of Motion The Work (physics) done by an object can be Position (vector) or negative. Since Force (Fk) and Displacement (vector) (s) are both Euclidean vector the result of the above equation depends on their Direction (geometry) If Fk acts in the same Direction (geometry) as the Motion then Position (vector) Work (physics) is being done. In this case the object on which the Force is applied gains Energy If the Direction (geometry) of Motion and Fk are opposite then negative Work (physics) is being done. This means that Energy is transferred in the opposite Direction (geometry) For example if you try to push car uphill by applying Force up the slope and instead the car rolls down the hill you are doing negative Work (physics) on the car. Alternatively the car is doing Position (vector) Work (physics) on you Important: The everyday use of the word Work (physics) differs from the Physics use. In Physics only the component of the applied Force that is parallel to the Motion does Work (physics) on an object. So for example person holding up heavy book does no Work (physics) on the book.

23.3|Energy|519

---------------------------------------------------------

23.3.1|External and Internal Forces|519
In Grade 10 you saw that Mechanical energy was conserved in the absence of external Force It is important to know whether Force is an internal Force or an external Force because this is related to whether the Force can change an objects total Mechanical energy when it does Work (physics) upon an object. When an external Force (for example Friction air Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance applied Force does Work (physics) on an object the total Mechanical energy Kinetic energy PE) of that object changes. If Position (vector) Work (physics) is done then the object will gain Energy If negative Work (physics) is done then the object will lose Energy The gain or loss in Energy can be in the form of Potential energy kinetic Energy or both. However the Work (physics) which is done is equal to the change in Mechanical energy of the object. When an internal Force does Work (physics) on an object by an (for example gravitational and spring Force the total Mechanical energy Kinetic energy PE) of that object remains constant but the objects Energy can change form. For example as an object falls in Gravitational field from high elevation to lower elevation some of the objects Potential energy is changed into kinetic Energy However the sum of the kinetic and Potential energy remain constant. When the only Force doing Work (physics) are internal Force Energy changes forms from kinetic to potential (or vice versa) yet the total amount of mechanical is conserved. 
---------------------------------------------------------

23.3.2|Capacity to do Work|520
Energy is the capacity to do Work (physics) When Position (vector) Work (physics) is done on an object the system doing the Work (physics) loses Energy In fact the Energy lost by system is exactly equal to the Work (physics) done by the system. An object with larger Potential energy has greater capacity to do Work (physics) This leads us to the work-energy theorem. Definition: Work-Energy Theorem The work-energy theorem states that the Work (physics) done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic Energy Kinetic energy KEf KEi The work-energy theorem is another example of the conservation of Energy which you saw in Grade 10. Important: Force only does Work (physics) on an object for the time that it is in contact with the object. For example person pushing trolley does Work (physics) on the trolley but the road does no Work (physics) on the tyres of car if they turn without slipping (the Force is not applied over any Distance because different piece of tyre touches the road every instant. Important: Energy Conservation In the absence of Friction the Work (physics) done on an object by system is equal to the Energy gained by the object. Work (physics) Done Energy Transferred In the presence of Friction only some of the Energy lost by the system is transferred to useful Energy The rest is lost to Friction Total Work (physics) Done Useful Work (physics) Done Work (physics) Done Against Friction In the example of falling Mass the Potential energy is known as gravitational Potential energy as it is the gravitational Force exerted by the earth which causes the Mass to accelerate towards the ground. The Gravitational field of the earth is what does the Work (physics) in this case. Another example is rubber-band. In order to stretch rubber-band we have to do Work (physics) on it. This means we transfer Energy to the rubber-band and it gains Potential energy This Potential energy is called Elasticity (physics) Potential energy Once released the rubber-band begins to move and Elasticity (physics) Potential energy is transferred into kinetic Energy 
---------------------------------------------------------

23.4|Power|525
Now that we understand the relationship between Work (physics) and Energy we are ready to look at quantity that defines how long it takes for certain amount of Work (physics) to be done. For example mother pushing trolley full of groceries can take 30 or 60 to push the trolley down an aisle. She does the same amount of Work (physics) but takes different Length of time. We use the idea of Power (physics) to describe the rate at which Work (physics) is done. Definition: Power (physics) Power (physics) is defined as the rate at which Work (physics) is done or the rate at which Energy is expended. The mathematical definition for Power (physics) is: The unit watt is named after Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt (19 January 1736 19 August 1819) whose improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the Industrial Revolution. key feature of it was that it brought the engine out of the remote coal Field (physics) into factories. Historically the horsepower (symbol hp) was the unit used to describe the Power (physics) delivered by machine. One horsepower is equivalent to approximately 750 W. The horsepower is sometimes used in the motor industry to describe the Power (physics) output of an engine. Incidentally the horsepower was derived by James Watt to give an indication of the Power (physics) of his steam engine in terms of the Power (physics) of horse which was what most people used to for example turn mill wheel. Machines are designed and built to do Work (physics) on objects. All machines usually have Power (physics) rating. The Power (physics) rating indicates the rate at which that machine can do Work (physics) upon other objects. car engine is an example of machine which is given Power (physics) rating. The Power (physics) rating relates to how rapidly the car can accelerate. Suppose that 50 kW engine could accelerate the car from km hr1 to 60km hr1 in 16 s. Then car with four times the Power (physics) rating (i.e. 200 kW) could do the same amount of Work (physics) in quarter of the time. That is 200 kW engine could accelerate the same car from km hr1 to 60km hr1 in s.

23.5|Important Equations and Quantities|529
Momentum: mv (23.4) Kinetic Energy Ek mv2 (23.5) Principle of Conservation of Energy Energy is never created nor destroyed but is merely transformed from one form to another. Conservation of Mechanical energy In the absence of Friction the total Mechanical energy of an object is conserved. When Force moves in the Direction (geometry) along which it acts Work (physics) is done. Work (physics) is the process of converting Energy Energy is the ability to do Work (physics)

24|Doppler Effect|533

---------------------------------------------------------

24.1|Introduction|533
Have you noticed how the Pitch (music) of car hooter changes as the car passes by or how the Pitch (music) of radio box on the pavement changes as you drive by? This effect is known as the Doppler effect and will be studied in this chapter. The Doppler effect is named after Johann Christian Andreas Doppler (29 November 1803 17 March 1853) an Austrian mathematician and physicist who first explained the phenomenon in 1842. 
---------------------------------------------------------

24.2|The Doppler Effect with Sound and Ultrasound|533
As seen in the introduction there are two situations which lead to the Doppler effect 1. When the source moves relative to the observer for example the Pitch (music) of car hooter as it passes by. 2. When the observer moves relative to the source for example the Pitch (music) of radio on the pavement as you drive by. Definition: Doppler effect The Doppler effect is the apparent change in Frequency and Wavelength of Wave when the observer and the source of the Wave move relative to each other. We experience the Doppler effect quite often in our lives without realising that it is science taking place. The changing Sound of taxi hooter or ambulance as it drives past are examples of this as you have seen in the introduction. The question is how does the Doppler effect take place. Let us consider source of Sound Wave with constant Frequency and Amplitude The Sound Wave can be drawn as concentric circles where each circle represents another wavefront like in figure 24.1 below. The Sound source is the dot in the middle and is stationary. For the Doppler effect to take place the source must be moving. Lets consider the following situation: The source (dot) emits one peak (represented by circle) that moves away from the source at the same rate in all Direction (geometry) As this peak moves away the source also moves and then emits the second peak. Now the two circles are not concentric any more but on the one side they are closer together and on the other side they are further apart. This is shown in the next diagram. If the source continues moving at the same Speed in the same Direction (geometry) (i.e. with the same Velocity which you will learn more about later). then the Distance between peaks on the right of the source is the constant. The Distance between peaks on the left is also constant but they are different on the left and right. This means that the time between peaks on the right is less so the Frequency is higher. It is higher than on the left and higher than if the source were not moving at all. On the left hand side the peaks are further apart than on the right and further apart than if the source were at rest this means the Frequency is lower. When car appoaches you the Sound Wave that reach you have shorter Wavelength and higher Frequency You hear higher Sound When the car moves away from you the Sound Wave that reach you have longer Wavelength and lower Frequency You hear lower Sound This change in Frequency can be calculated by using: where fL is the Frequency perceived by the listener fS is the Frequency of the source is the Speed of the Wave vL the Speed of the listener and vS the Speed of the source. Radar-based speed-traps use the Doppler effect The radar gun emits radio Wave of specific Frequency When the car is standing still the Wave Reflection (physics) Wave are the same Frequency as the Wave emitted by the radar gun. When the car is moving the Doppler Frequency shift can be used to determine the Speed of the car. 
---------------------------------------------------------

24.2.1|Ultrasound and the Doppler Effect|537
Ultrasonic Wave (ultrasound) are Sound Wave with Frequency greater than 20 000 Hertz (the upper limit of hearing). These Wave can be used in medicine to determine the Direction (geometry) of blood flow. The device called Doppler flow Metre sends out Sound Wave The Sound Wave can travle through skin and tissue and will be Reflection (physics) by moving objects in the body (like blood). The Reflection (physics) Wave return to the flow Metre where its Frequency (received Frequency is compared to the transmitted Frequency Because of the Doppler effect blood that is moving towards the flow Metre will change the Sound to higher Frequency (blue shift) and blood that is moving away from the flow Metre will cause lower Frequency (red shift). Ultrasound can be used to determine whether blood is flowing in the right Direction (geometry) in the circulation system of unborn babies or identify areas in the body where blood flow is restricted due to narrow veins. The use of ultrasound equipment in medicine is called sonography or ultrasonography. 
---------------------------------------------------------

24.3|The Doppler Effect with Light|537
Light is Wave and earlier you learnt how you can study the properties of one Wave and apply the same ideas to another Wave The same applies to Sound and Light We know the Doppler effect affects Sound Wave when the source is moving. Therefore if we apply the Doppler effect to Light the Frequency of the emitted Light should change when the source of the Light is moving relative to the observer. When the Frequency of Sound Wave changes the Sound you hear changes. When the Frequency of Light changes the Color you would see changes. This means that the Doppler effect can be observed by change in Sound (for Sound Wave and change in Color (for Light Wave Keep in mind that there are Sound that we cannot hear (for example ultrasound) and Light that we cannot see (for example ultraviolet Light We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to Light When talking about Light we use slightly different names to describe what happens. If you look at the Color spectrum (more details Chapter 30) then you will see that blue Light has shorter Wavelength than red Light If you are in the middle of the visible Color then longer Wavelength are more red and shorter Wavelength are more blue. So we call shifts towards longer Wavelength red-shifts and shifts towards shorter Wavelength blue-shifts. shift in Wavelength is the same as shift in Frequency Longer Wavelength of Light have lower Frequency and shorter Wavelength have higher Frequency From the Doppler effect we know that when things move towards you any Wave they emit that you measure are shifted to shorter Wavelength (blueshifted). If things move away from you the shift is to longer Wavelength (redshifted). 
---------------------------------------------------------

24.3.1|The Expanding Universe|538
Stars emit Light which is why we can see them at night. Galaxies are huge collections of stars. An example is our own Galaxy the Milky Way of which our sun is only one of the millions of stars Using large Telescope like the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in the Karoo astronomers can measure the Light from distant galaxies. The spectrum of Light (see Chapter ??) can tell us what elements are in the stars in the galaxies because each element emitsabsorbs Light at particular Wavelength (called spectral lines). If these lines are observed to be shifted from their usual Wavelength to shorter Wavelength then the Light from the galaxy is said to be blueshifted. If the spectral lines are shifted to longer Wavelength then the Light from the galaxy is said to be redshifted. If we think of the blueshift and redshift in Doppler effect terms then blueshifted galaxy would appear to be moving towards us (the observers) and redshifted galaxy would appear to be moving away from us. Important: If the Light source is moving away from the observer Position (vector) Velocity then the observed Frequency is lower and the observed Wavelength is greater (redshifted). If the source is moving towards (negative Velocity the observer the observed fre- quency is higher and the Wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). Edwin Hubble (20 November 1889 28 September 1953) measured the Doppler shift of large sample of galaxies. He found that the Light from distant galaxies is redshifted and he discovered that there is proportionality relationship between the redshift and the Distance to the galaxy. Galaxies that are further away always appear more redshifted than nearby galaxies. Remember that redshift in Doppler terms means Velocity of the Light source away from the observer. So why do all distant galaxies appear to be moving away from our Galaxy? The reason is that the universe is expanding The galaxies are not actually moving themselves rather the space between them is expanding

25|Colour|541

---------------------------------------------------------

25.1|Introduction|541
We call the Light that we humans can see visible Light Visible Light is actually just small part of the large spectrum of Electromagnetic radiation which you will learn more about in Chapter 30. We can think of Electromagnetic radiation and visible Light as transverse Wave We know that transverse Wave can be described by their Amplitude Frequency (or Wavelength and Velocity The Velocity of Wave is given by the product of its Frequency and Wavelength (25.1) However Electromagnetic radiation including visible Light is special because no matter what the Frequency it all moves at constant Velocity (in vacuum) which is known as the Speed of Light The Speed of Light has the symbol and is: 108 m.s1 Since the Speed of Light is we can then say: 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.2|Colour and Light|541
Our eyes are sensitive to visible Light over range of Wavelength from 390 nm to 780 nm (1 nm 109 m). The different Color of Light we see are related to specific Frequency (and Wavelength of visible Light The Wavelength and Frequency are listed in table 25.1. You can see from table 25.1 that violet Light has the shortest Wavelength and highest Frequency while red Light has the longest Wavelength and lowest Frequency 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.2.1|Dispersion of white light|544
White Light like the Light which comes from the sun is made up of all the visible Wavelength of Light In other words white Light is combination of all the Color of visible Light In Chapter you learnt that the Speed of Light is different in different substances. The Speed of Light in different substances depends on the Frequency of the Light For example when white Light travels through glass Light of the different Frequency is slowed down by different amounts. The lower the Frequency the less the Speed is reduced which means that red Light (lowest Frequency is slowed down less than violet Light (highest Frequency We can see this when white Light is incident on glass prism. Have look at the picture below. When the white Light hits the edge of the prism the Light which travels through the glass is Refraction as it moves from the less dense medium (air) to the more dense medium (glass). The red Light which is slowed down the least is Refraction the least. The violet Light which is slowed down the most is Refraction the most. When the Light hits the other side of the prism it is again Refraction but the angle of the prism edge allows the Light to remain separated into its different Color White Light is therefore separated into its different Color by the prism and we say that the white Light has been dispersed by the prism. The dispersion effect is also responsible for why we see rainbows. When sunlight hits drops of water in the atmosphere the white Light is dispersed into its different Color by the water. 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.3|Addition and Subtraction of Light|544

---------------------------------------------------------

25.3.1|Additive Primary Colours|544
The primary Color of Light are red green and blue. When all the primary Color are superposed (added together) white Light is produced. Red green and blue are therefore called the additive primary Color All the other Color can be produced by different combinations of red green and blue. 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.3.2|Subtractive Primary Colours|545
The subtractive primary Color are obtained by subtracting one of the three additive primary Color from white Light The subtractive primary Color are yellow magenta and cyan. Magenta appears as pinkish-purplish Color and cyan looks greenish-blue. You can see how the primary Color of Light add up to the different subtractive Color in the illustration below. 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.3.3|Complementary Colours|546
Complementary Color are two Color of Light which add together to give white. You should have found that the complementary Color for red green and blue are: Red and Cyan Green and Magenta Blue and Yellow 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.3.4|Perception of Colour|546
The light-sensitive lining on the back inside half of the human eye is called the retina. The retina contains two kinds of Light sensitive cells or photoreceptors: the rod cells (sensitive to low Light and the cone cells (sensitive to normal daylight) which enable us to see. The rods are not very sensitive to Color but Work (physics) well in dimly lit conditions. This is why it is possible to see in dark room but it is Hardness to see any Color Only your rods are sensitive to the low Light levels and so you can only see in black white and grey. The cones enable us to see Color Normally there are three kinds of cones each containing different Pigment The cones are activated when the Pigment absorb Light The three types of cones are sensitive to (i.e. absorb) red blue and green Light respectively. Therefore we can perceive all the different Color in the visible spectrum when the different types of cones are stimulated by different amounts since they are just combinations of the three primary Color of Light The rods and cones have different response times to Light The cones react quickly when bright Light falls on them. The rods take longer time to react. This is why it takes while (about 10 minutes) for your eyes to adjust when you enter dark room after being outside on sunny day. Color blindness in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all Color that other people can see. Most often it is genetic problem but may also occur because of eye nerve or brain damage or due to exposure to certain chemicals. The most common forms of human Color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long Wavelength sensitive cone systems and involve difficulties in discriminating reds yellows and greens from one another. This is called red-green Color blindness. Other forms of Color blindness are much rarer. They include problems in discriminating blues from yellows and the rarest forms of all complete Color blindness or monochromasy where one cannot distinguish any Color from grey as in black-and-white movie or photograph. 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.3.5|Colours on a Television Screen|547
If you look very closely at Color cathode-ray television screen or computer screen you will see that there are very many small red green and blue dots called phosphors on it. These dots are caused to fluoresce (glow brightly) when beam of Electron from the cathode-ray tube behind the screen hits them. Since different combinations of the three primary Color of Light can produce any other Color only red green and blue dots are needed to make pictures containing all the Color of the visible spectrum. 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.4|Pigments and Paints|548
We have learnt that white Light is combination of all the Color of the visible spectrum and that each Color of Light is related to different Frequency But what gives everyday objects around us their different Color Pigment are substances which give an object its Color by absorbing certain Frequency of Light and Reflection (physics) other Frequency For example red Pigment absorbs all Color of Light except red which it Reflection (physics) Paints and inks contain Pigment which gives the paints and inks different Color 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.4.1|Colour of opaque objects|548
Objects which you cannot see through (i.e. they are not transparent) are called opaque. Examples of some opaque objects are metals wood and bricks. The Color of an opaque object is determined by the Color (therefore Frequency of Light which it Reflection (physics) For example when white Light strikes blue opaque object such as ruler the ruler will absorb all Frequency of Light except blue which will be Reflection (physics) The Reflection (physics) blue Light is the Light which makes it into our eyes and therefore the object will appear blue. Opaque objects which appear white do not absorb any Light They Reflection (physics) all the Frequency Black opaque objects absorb all Frequency of Light They do not Reflection (physics) at all and therefore appear to have no Color 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.4.2|Colour of transparent objects|548
If an object is transparent it means that you can see through it. For example glass clean water and some clear Plasticity (physics) are transparent. The Color of transparent object is determined by the Color Frequency of Light which it transmits (allows to pass through it). For example cup made of green glass will appear green because it absorbs all the other Frequency of Light except green which it transmits. This is the Light which we receive in our eyes and the object appears green. 
---------------------------------------------------------

25.4.3|Pigment primary colours|549
The primary Pigment and paints are cyan magenta and yellow. When Pigment or paints of these three Color are mixed together in equal amounts they produce black. Any other Color of paint can be made by mixing the primary Pigment together in different quantities. The primary Pigment are related to the primary Color of Light in the following way: Color printers only use Color of ink: cyan magenta yellow and black. All the other Color can be mixed from these 
---------------------------------------------------------

26|2D and 3D Wavefronts|553

---------------------------------------------------------

26.1|Introduction|553
You have learnt about the basic principles of Reflection (physics) and Refraction In this chapter you will learn about phenomena that arise with Wave in two and three dimensions: interference and Diffraction 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.2|Wavefronts|553
Consider three point sources of Wave If each source emits Wave isotropically (i.e. the same in all Direction (geometry) we will get the situation shown in as shown in Figure 26.1. We define wavefront as the imaginary line that joins Wave that are in phase. These are indicated by the grey vertical lines in Figure 26.1. The points that are in phase can be peaks Crest (physics) or anything in between it doesnt matter which points you choose as long as they are in phase. Figure 26.1: Wavefronts are imaginary lines joining Wave that are in phase. In the example the wavefronts (shown by the grey vertical lines) join all Wave at the Crest (physics) of their cycle. 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.3|The Huygens Principle|554
Christiaan Huygens described how to determine the path of Wave through medium. Definition: The Huygens–Fresnel principle Each point on wavefront acts like point source of circular Wave The Wave emitted from these point sources interfere to form another wavefront. simple example of the Huygens–Fresnel principle is to consider the single wavefront in Figure 26.2. Christiaan Huygens (14 April 1629 July 1695) was Dutch mathematician astronomer and physicist born in The Hague as the son of Constantijn Huygens. He studied law at the University of Leiden and the College of Orange in Breda before turning to science. Historians commonly associate Huygens with the scientific revolution. Huygens generally receives minor credit for his role in the development of modern calculus. He also achieved note for his arguments that Light consisted of Wave see: wave-particle duality. In 1655 he discovered Saturns moon Titan. He also examined Saturns planetary rings and in 1656 he discovered that those rings consisted of rocks. In the same year he observed and sketched the Orion Nebula. He also discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars. 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.4|Interference|556
Interference occurs when two identical Wave pass through the same region of space at the same time resulting in superposition of Wave There are two types of interference which is of interest: constructive interference and destructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when both Wave have Displacement (vector) in the same Direction (geometry) while destructive interference occurs when one Wave has Displacement (vector) in the opposite Direction (geometry) to the other thereby resulting in cancellation. There is no Displacement (vector) of the medium in destructive interference while for constructive interference the Displacement (vector) of the medium is greater than the individual Displacement (vector) Constructive interference occurs when both Wave have Displacement (vector) in the same Direction (geometry) this means they both have peak or they both have Crest (physics) at the same place at the same time. If they both have peak then the peaks add together to form bigger peak. If they both have Crest (physics) then the Crest (physics) gets deeper. Destructive interference occurs when one Wave has Displacement (vector) in the opposite Direction (geometry) to the other this means that the one Wave has peak and the other Wave has Crest (physics) If the Wave have identical magnitudes then the peak fills up the Crest (physics) and the medium will look like there are no Wave at that point. There will be no Displacement (vector) of the medium. place where destructive interference takes places is called node. Wave can interfere at places where there is never Crest (physics) and Crest (physics) or peak and peak or Crest (physics) and peak at the same time. At these places the Wave will add together and the resultant Displacement (vector) will be the sum of the two Wave but they wont be points of maximum interference. Consider the two identical Wave shown in the picture below. The wavefronts of the peaks are shown as black lines while the wavefronts of the Crest (physics) are shown as grey lines. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add together to form bigger peak. Two points sources (A and B) radiate identical Wave The wavefronts of the peaks (black lines) and Crest (physics) (grey lines) are shown. Constructive interference occurs where two black lines intersect or where two gray lines intersect. Destructive interference occurs where black line intersects with grey line. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add together to form bigger peak. When the grey lines cross other grey lines there are two Crest (physics) are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two Crest (physics) add together to form bigger Crest (physics) In the case where grey line crosses black line we are seeing Crest (physics) and peak in the same place. These will cancel each other out and the medium will have no Displacement (vector) at that point. black line black line peak peak constructive interference grey line grey line Crest (physics) Crest (physics) constructive interference black line grey line grey line black line peak Crest (physics) Crest (physics) peak destructive interference On half the picture below we have marked the constructive interference with solid black diamond and the destructive interference with hollow diamond. To see if you understand it cover up the half we have marked with diamonds and try to Work (physics) out which points are constructive and destructive on the other half of the picture. The two halves are Mirror image of each other so you can check yourself. 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.5|Diffraction|557
One of the most interesting and also very useful properties of Wave is Diffraction Definition: Diffraction Diffraction is the ability of Wave to spread out in wavefronts as the Wave passes through small aperture or around sharp edge. Extension: Diffraction Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with Wave propagation such as the bending spreading and interference of Wave emerging from an aperture. It occurs with any type of Wave including Sound Wave water Wave electromagnetic Wave such as Light and radio Wave While Diffraction always occurs its effects are generally only noticeable for Wave where the Wavelength is on the order of the feature size of the Diffraction objects or apertures. For example if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and Sound is produced in remote corner of one of them person in the other room will hear the Sound as if it originated at the doorway. As far as the second room is concerned the vibrating air in the doorway is the source of the Sound The same is true of Light passing the edge of an obstacle but this is not as easily observed because of the short Wavelength of visible Light This means that when Wave move through small holes they appear to bend around the sides because there are not enough points on the wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This is bending round the sides we call Diffraction Extension: Diffraction Diffraction effects are more clear for water Wave with longer Wavelength Diffraction can be demonstrated by placing small barriers and obstacles in ripple tank and observing the path of the water Wave as they encounter the obstacles. The Wave are seen to pass around the barrier into the regions behind it subsequently the water behind the barrier is disturbed. The amount of Diffraction (the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing Wavelength and decreases with decreasing Wavelength In fact when the Wavelength of the Wave are smaller than the obstacle no noticeable Diffraction occurs. 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.5.1|Diffraction through a Slit|558
When Wave strikes barrier with hole only part of the Wave can move through the hole. If the hole is similar in size to the Wavelength of the Wave Diffraction occurs. The Wave that comes through the hole no longer looks like straight Wave front. It bends around the edges of the hole. If the hole is small enough it acts like point source of circular Wave Now if allow the wavefront to impinge on barrier with hole in it then only the points on the wavefront that move into the hole can continue emitting forward moving Wave but because lot of the wavefront have been removed the points on the edges of the hole emit Wave that bend round the edges. If you employ Huygens–Fresnel principle you can see the effect is that the wavefronts are no longer straight lines. Each point of the slit acts like point source. If we think about the two point sources on the edges of the slit and call them and then we can go back to the diagram we had earlier but with some parts block by the wall. If this diagram were showing Sound Wave then the Sound would be louder (constructive interference) in some places and quieter (destructive interference) in others. You can start to see that there will be pattern (interference pattern) to the louder and quieter places. If we were studying Light Wave then the Light would be brighter in some places than others depending on the interferences. The intensity (how bright or loud) of the interference pattern for single narrow slit looks like this: The picture above shows how the Wave add together to form the interference pattern. The peaks correspond to places where the Wave are adding most intensely and the zeroes are places where destructive interference is taking place. When looking at interference patterns from Light the spectrum looks like: There is formula we can use to determine where the peaks and minimums are in the interference spectrum. There will be more than one minimum. There are the same number of minima on either side of the central peak and the Distance from the first one on each side are the same to the peak. The Distance to the peak from the second minimum on each side is also the same in fact the two sides are Mirror image of each other. We label the first minimum that corresponds to Position (vector) angle from the centre as and the first on the other side (a negative angle from the centre as the second set of minima are labelled and etc. The equation for the angle at which the minima occur is Definition: Interference Minima The angle at which the minima in the interference spectrum occur is: sin where is the angle to the minimum is the Wavelength of the impinging wavefronts is the order of the mimimum 123 ... From the formula you can see that smaller Wavelength for the same slit results in smaller angle to the interference minimum. This is something you just saw in the two Work (physics) examples. Do sanity check go back and see if the answer makes sense. Ask yourself which Light had the longer Wavelength which Light had the larger angle and what do you expect for longer Wavelength from the formula.

26.6|Shock Waves and Sonic Booms|562
Now we know that the Wave move away from the source at the Speed of Sound What happens if the source moves at the same time as emitting Sound Once Sound Wave has been emitted it is no longer connected to the source so if the source moves it doesnt change the way the Sound Wave is propagating through the medium. This means source can actually catch up with Sound Wave it has emitted. The Speed of Sound is very fast in air about 340 s1 so if we want to talk about source catching up to Sound Wave then the source has to be able to move very fast. good source of Sound Wave to discuss is jet aircraft. Fighter jets can move very fast and they are very noisy so they are good source of Sound for our discussion. Here are the Speed for selection of aircraft that can fly faster than the Speed of Sound 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.6.1|Subsonic Flight|563
Definition: Subsonic Subsonic refers to Speed slower than the Speed of Sound When source emits Sound Wave and is moving but slower than the Speed of Sound you get the situation in this picture. Notice that the source moving means that the wavefronts and therefore peaks in the Wave are actually closer together in the one Direction (geometry) and further apart in the other. subsonic flight If you measure the Wave on the side where the peaks are closer together youll measure different Wavelength than on the other side of the source. This means that the noise from the source will Sound different on the different sides. This is called the Doppler effect Definition: Doppler effect when the Wavelength and Frequency measured by an observer are different to those emitted by the source due to movement of the source or observer. 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.6.2|Supersonic Flight|563
Definition: Supersonic Supersonic refers to Speed faster than the Speed of Sound If plane flies at exactly the Speed of Sound then the Wave that it emits in the Direction (geometry) it is flying wont be able to get away from the plane. It also means that the next Sound Wave emitted will be exactly on top of the previous one look at this picture to see what the wavefronts would look like: Sometimes we use the Speed of Sound as reference to describe the Speed of the object (aircraft in our discussion). Definition: Mach Number The Mach Number is the ratio of the Speed of an object to the Speed of Sound in the surrounding medium. Mach number is tells you how many times faster than Sound the aircraft is moving. Mach Number aircraft moving slower than the Speed of Sound Mach Number aircraft moving at the Speed of Sound Mach Number aircraft moving faster than the Speed of Sound To Work (physics) out the Mach Number divide the Speed of the aircraft by the Speed of Sound Mach Number vaircraft vsound Remember: the units must be the same before you divide. If the aircraft is moving faster than the Speed of Sound then the wavefronts look like this: If the source moves faster than the Speed of Sound cone of Wave fronts is created. This is called Mach cone. From constructive interference we know that two peaks that add together form larger peak. In Mach cone many many peaks add together to form very large peak this is Sound Wave so the large peak is very very loud Sound Wave This Sound like huge boom and we call the noise Sonic boom Definition: Sonic boom Sonic boom is the Sound heard by an observer as shockwave passes. 
---------------------------------------------------------

26.6.3|Mach Cone|566
You can see that the shape of the Mach Cone depends on the Speed of the aircraft. When the Mach Number is there is no cone but as the aircraft goes faster and faster the angle of the cone gets smaller and smaller. If we go back to the supersonic picture we can Work (physics) out what the angle of the cone must be. We build triangle between how far the plane has moved and how far wavefront at right angles to the Direction (geometry) the plane is flying has moved: An aircraft emits Sound wavefront. The wavefront moves at the Speed of Sound 340 s1 and the aircraft moves at Mach 1.5 which is 1.5 340 510 s1. The aircraft travels faster than the wavefront. If we let the wavefront travel for time then the following diagram will apply: We know how fast the wavefront and the aircraft are moving so we know the Distance that they have traveled: The angle between the cone that forms at the Direction (geometry) of the plane can be found from the right-angle triangle we have drawn into the figure. We know that sin opposite hypotenuse which in this figure means: sin opposite hypotenuse sin vsound vaircraft sin vsound vaircraft In this case we have used Sound and aircraft but more general way of saying this is: aircraft source Sound wavefront We often just write the equation as:

27|Wave Nature of Matter|571

---------------------------------------------------------

27.1|Introduction|571
In chapters 30 and 31 the so called wave-particle duality if Light is described. This duality states that Light displays properties of both Wave and of particles depending on the experiment performed. For example interference and Diffraction of Light are properties of its Wave nature while the Photoelectric effect is property of its particle nature. In fact we call particle of Light photon. Hopefully you have realised that nature loves symmetry. So if Light which was originally believed to be Wave also has particle nature then perhaps particles also display Wave nature. In other words matter which which we originally thought of as particles may also display wave-particle duality. 
---------------------------------------------------------

27.2|de Broglie Wavelength|571
Einstein showed that for photon its momentum is equal to its Energy divided the Speed of Light c: The Energy of the photon can also be expressed in terms of the Wavelength of the Light hc where is Plancks constant. Combining these two equations we find that the the momentum of the photon is related to its Wavelength hc or equivalently In 1923 Louis de Broglie proposed that this equation not only holds for photons but also holds for particles of matter. This is known as the de Broglie hypothesis Definition: De Broglie Hypothesis particle of Mass moving with Velocity has Wavelength related to is momentum mv by mv (27.1) This Wavelength is known as the de Broglie Wavelength of the particle. Since the value of Plancks constant is incredibly small 6.63 1034 the wavelike nature of everyday objects is not really observable. The de Broglie hypothesis was proposed by French physicist Louis de Broglie (15 August 1892 19 March 1987) in 1923 in his PhD thesis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for this Work (physics) which made him the first person to receive Nobel Prize on PhD thesis. This Wavelength is considerably smaller than the diameter of proton which is approximately 1015 m. Hence the wave-like properties of this cricket ball are too small to be observed. Although the Electron and cricket ball in the two previous examples are travelling at the same Velocity the de Broglie Wavelength of the Electron is much larger than that of the cricket ball. This is because the Wavelength is inversely proportional to the Mass of the particle. Since the de Broglie Wavelength of particle is inversely proportional to its Velocity the Wavelength decreases as the Velocity increases. This is confirmed in the last two examples with the Electron De Broglies hypothesis was confirmed by Davisson and Germer in 1927 when they observed beam of Electron being Diffraction off nickel surface. The Diffraction means that the moving Electron have Wave nature. They were also able to determine the Wavelength of the Electron from the Diffraction To measure Wavelength one needs two or more diffacting centres such as pinholes slits or atoms. For Diffraction to occur the centres must be separated by Distance about the same size as the Wavelength Theoretically all objects not just sub-atomic particles exhibit Wave properties according to the de Broglie hypothesis. 
---------------------------------------------------------

27.3|The Electron Microscope|574
We have seen that under certain circumstances particles behave like Wave This idea is used in the Electron Optical microscope which is type of Optical microscope that uses Electron to create an image of the target. It has much higher Magnification or resolving Power (physics) than normal Light Optical microscope up to two million times allowing it to see smaller objects and details. Lets first review how regular Optical microscope Work (physics) beam of Light is shone through thin target and the image is then magnified and focused using objective and ocular lenses. The amount of Light which passes through the target depends on the densities of the target since the less dens regions allow more Light to pass through than the denser regions. This means that the beam of Light which is partially transmitted through the target carries information about the inner structure of the target. The original form of the Electron microscopy the transmission Electron microscopy Work (physics) in similar manner using Electron In the Electron Optical microscope Electron which are emitted by cathode are formed into beam using Magnet lenses. This Electron beam is then passed through very thin target. Again the regions in the target with higher densities stop the Electron more easily. So the amount of Electron which pass through the different regions of the target depend their densities. This means that the partially transmitted beam of Electron carries information about the densities of the inner structure of the target. The spatial variation in this information (the image) is then magnified by series of Magnet lenses and it is recorded by hitting fluorescent screen photographic plate or Light sensitive sensor such as CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. The image detected by the CCD may be displayed in real time on monitor or computer. In figure ?? is an image of the polio virus obtained with transmission Electron Optical microscope The structure of an Geometrical optics and Electron Optical microscope are compared in figure 27.3. While the Optical microscope uses Light and focuses using lenses the Electron Optical microscope uses Electron and focuses using electromagnets. The first Electron Optical microscope prototype was built in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Maximillion Knoll. It was based on the ideas and discoveries of Louis de Broglie. Although it was primitive and was not ideal for practical use the instrument was still capable of magnifying objects by four hundred times. The first practical Electron Optical microscope was built at the Electron Optical microscope are very useful as they are able to magnify objects to much higher resolution. This is because their de Broglie Wavelength are so much smaller than that of visible Light You hopefully remember that Light is Diffraction by objects which are separated by Distance of about the same size as the Wavelength of the Light This Diffraction then prevents you from being able to focus the transmitted Light into an image. So the sizes at which Diffraction occurs for beam of Electron is much smaller than those for visible Light This is why you can magnify targets to much higher order of Magnification using Electron rather than visible Light Extension: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Optical microscope (HRTEM) There are high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) which have been built. However their resolution is limited by spherical and chromatic aberration. Fortunately though software correction of the spherical aberration has allowed the production of images with very high resolution. In fact the resolution is sufficient to show carbon atoms in diamond separated by only 89 picometers and atoms in silicon at 78 picometers. This is at Magnification of 50 million times. The ability to determine the Position (vector) of atoms within materials has made the HRTEM very useful tool for nano-technologies research. It is also very important for the development of semiconductor devices for Electron and photonics. Transmission Electron Optical microscope produce two-dimensional images. Extension: Scanning Electron Optical microscope (SEM) The Scanning Electron Optical microscope (SEM) produces images by hitting the target with primary Electron beam which then excites the surface of the target. This causes secondary Electron to be emitted from the surface which are then detected. So the the Electron beam in the SEM is moved across the sample while detectors build an image from the secondary Electron Generally the transmission Electron Optical microscope resolution is about an order of magnitude better than the SEM resolution however because the SEM image relies on surface processes rather than transmission it is able to image bulk samples and has much greater depth of view and so can produce images that are good representation of the 3D structure of the sample. 
---------------------------------------------------------

27.3.1|Disadvantages of an Electron Microscope|577
Electron Optical microscope are expensive to buy and maintain. they are also very sensitive to vibration and external Magnet Field (physics) This means that special facilities are required to house Optical microscope aimed at achieving high resolutions. Also the targets have to be viewed in vacuum as the Electron would Scattering with the molecules that make up air. Extension: Scanning Electron Optical microscope (SEM) Scanning Electron Optical microscope usually image conductive or semi-conductive materials best. common preparation technique is to coat the target with several-nanometer layer of conductive material such as gold from sputtering machine however this process has the potential to disturb delicate samples. The targets have to be prepared in many ways to give proper detail which may result in artifacts purely the result of treatment. This gives the problem of distinguishing artifacts from material particularly in biological samples. Scientists maintain that the results from various preparation techniques have been compared and as there is no reason that they should all produce similar artifacts it is therefore reasonable to believe that Electron microscopy features correlate with living cells. The first Electron Optical microscope prototype was built in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Maximillion Knoll. It was based on the ideas and discoveries of Louis de Broglie. Although it was primitive and was not ideal for practical use the instrument was still capable of magnifying objects by four hundred times. The first practical Electron Optical microscope was built at the University of Toronto in 1938 by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall James Hillier and Albert Prebus. Although modern Electron Optical microscope can magnify objects up to two million times they are still based upon Ruskas prototype and his correlation between Wavelength and resolution. The Electron Optical microscope is an integral part of many laboratories. Researchers use it to examine biological materials (such as microorganisms and cells) variety of large molecules medical biopsy samples metals and Crystallinity structures and the characteristics of various surfaces. 
---------------------------------------------------------

27.3.2|Uses of Electron Microscopes|577
Electron Optical microscope can be used to study: the topography of an object how its surface looks. the morphology of particles making up an object its shape and size. the composition of an object the elements and compounds that the object is composed of and the relative amounts of them. the crystallographic information of the object how the atoms are arranged in the object. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28|Electrodynamics|579

---------------------------------------------------------

28.1|Introduction|579
In Grade 11 you learnt how Magnet Field (physics) is generated around Electric current carrying Electrical conductor You also learnt how Electric current is generated in Electrical conductor that moves in Magnet Field (physics) This chapter describes how Electrical conductor moved in Magnet Field (physics) are applied in the real-world. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.2|Electrical machines - generators and motors|579
We have seen that when Electrical conductor is moved in Magnet Field (physics) or when Magnet is moved near Electrical conductor such that the Magnet Field (physics) is not parallel to the Electrical conductor Electric current flows in the Electrical conductor The amount of Electric current depends on the Speed at which the Electrical conductor experiences changing Magnet Field (physics) the number of turns of the Electrical conductor and the orientation of the plane of the Electrical conductor with respect to the Magnet Field (physics) The effect of the orientation of the Electrical conductor with respect to the Magnet Field (physics) is shown in Figure 28.1. Figure 28.1: Series of figures showing that the Magnet flux through Electrical conductor is dependent on the angle that the plane of the Electrical conductor makes with the Magnet Field (physics) The greatest flux passes through the Electrical conductor when the plane of the Electrical conductor is perpendicular to the Magnet Field (physics) lines as in (a). The number of Field (physics) lines passing through the Electrical conductor decreases as the Electrical conductor rotates until it is parallel to the Magnet Field (physics) If the Electric current flowing in the Electrical conductor were plotted as function of the angle between the plane of the Electrical conductor and the Magnet Field (physics) then the Electric current would vary as shown in Figure 28.2. The Electric current alternates about the zero value and is also known as an alternating Electric current (abbreviated AC). Figure 28.2: Variation of Electric current as angle of plane of Electrical conductor with the Magnet Field (physics) changes. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.2.1|Electrical generators|580
AC generator The principle of rotating Electrical conductor in Magnet Field (physics) is used in electricity generators. generator converts Mechanical energy into electrical Energy Definition: Generator generator converts Mechanical energy into electrical Energy The layout of an AC generator is shown in Figure 28.3. The Electrical conductor in the shape of coil is connected to ring. The Electrical conductor is then manually rotated in the Magnet Field (physics) generating an alternating Electromotive force The slip rings are connected to the load via brushes. If machine is constructed to rotate Magnet Field (physics) around set of stationary wire coils with the turning of shaft AC Voltage will be produced across the wire coils as that shaft is rotated in accordance with Faradays Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic operating principle of an AC generator. In an AC generator the two ends of the coil are each attached to slip ring that makes contact with brushes as the coil turns. The Direction (geometry) of the Electric current changes with every half turn of the coil. As one side of the loop moves to the other pole of the Magnet Field (physics) the Electric current in it changes Direction (geometry) The two slip rings of the AC generator allow the Electric current to change Direction (geometry) and become alternating Electric current AC generators are also known as alternators. They are found in motor cars to Electric charge the car battery. DC generator DC generator is constructed the same way as an AC generator except that there is one slip ring which is split into two pieces called commutator so the Electric current in the external circuit does not change Direction (geometry) The layout of DC generator is shown in Figure 28.4. The split-ring commutator accommodates for the change in Direction (geometry) of the Electric current in the loop thus creating DC Electric current going through the brushes and out to the circuit. The shape of the Electromotive force from DC generator is shown in Figure 28.5. The Electromotive force is not steady but is more or less the Position (vector) halves of sine Wave AC versus DC generators The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with moving coil should be obvious (sparking and heat) especially if the shaft of the generator is revolving at high Speed If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapors the practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater. An AC generator (alternator) does not require brushes and commutators to Work (physics) and so is immune to these problems experienced by DC generators. The benefits of AC over DC with regard to generator design is also Reflection (physics) in electric motors. While DC motors require the use of brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire AC motors do not. In fact AC and DC motor designs are very similar to their generator counterparts. The AC motor being dependent upon the reversing Magnet Field (physics) produced by alternating Electric current through its stationary coils of wire to rotate the rotating Magnet around on its shaft and the DC motor being dependent on the brush contacts making and breaking connections to reverse Electric current through the rotating coil every 12 rotation (180 degrees). 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.2.2|Electric motors|582
The basic principles of operation for motor are the same as that of generator except that motor converts electrical Energy into Mechanical energy Definition: Motor An electric motor converts electrical Energy into Mechanical energy Both motors and generators can be explained in terms of coil that rotates in Magnet Field (physics) In generator the coil is attached to an external circuit and it is mechanically turned resulting in changing flux that induces an Electromotive force In motor current-carrying coil in Magnet Field (physics) experiences Force on both sides of the coil creating Torque which makes it turn. Any coil carrying Electric current can feel Force in Magnet Field (physics) the Force is the Lorentz Force on the moving Electric charge in the Electrical conductor We know that if the coil is parallel to the Magnet Field (physics) then the Lorentz Force will be zero. The Electric charge of opposite sides of the coil will be in opposite Direction (geometry) because the Electric charge are moving in opposite Direction (geometry) This means the coil will rotate. Instead of rotating the loops through Magnet Field (physics) to create electricity Electric current is sent through the wires creating electromagnets. The outer Magnet will then repel the electromagnets and rotate the shaft as an electric motor. If the Electric current is AC the two slip rings are required to create an AC motor. An AC motor is shown in Figure 28.6 If the Electric current is DC split-ring commutators are required to create DC motor. This is shown in Figure 28.7. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.2.3|Real-life applications|582
Cars car contains an alternator that Electric charge up its battery Power (physics) the cars electric system when its engine is running. Alternators have the great advantage over direct-current generators of not using commutator which makes them simpler lighter less costly and more rugged than DC generator. car also contains DC electric motor the starter motor to turn over the engine to start it. starter consists of the very Power (physics) DC electric motor and starter solenoid that is attached to the motor. starter motor requires very high Electric current to crank the engine thats why its connected to the battery with large cables. Electricity Generation AC generators are mainly used in the real-world to generate electricity. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.3|Alternating Current|585
Most students of electricity begin their study with what is known as Direction (geometry) Electric current (DC) which is electricity flowing in constant Direction (geometry) DC is the kind of electricity made by battery with definite Position (vector) and negative terminals). However we have seen that the electricity produced by generator alternates and is therefore known as alternating current(AC). The main advantage to AC is that the Voltage can be changed using transformers. That means that the Voltage can be stepped up at Power (physics) stations to very high Voltage so that electrical Energy can be transmitted along Power (physics) lines at low Electric current and therefore experience low Energy loss due to heating. The Voltage can then be stepped down for use in buildings and street Light In South Africa alternating Electric current is generated at Frequency of 50 Hertz The circuit symbol for alternating Electric current is: Graphs of Voltage against time and Electric current against time for an AC circuit are shown in Figure 28.9 In DC circuit the Electric current and Voltage are constant. In an AC circuit the Electric current and Voltage vary with time. The value of the Electric current or Voltage at any specific moment in time is called the instantaneous Electric current or Voltage and is calculated as follows: Imaxsin(2ft) Vmaxsin(2ft) is the instantaneous Electric current Imax is the maximum Electric current is the instantaneous Voltage Vmax is the maximum Voltage is the Frequency of the AC and is the time at which the instantaneous Electric current or Voltage is being calculated. This average value we use for AC is known as the root mean square (rms) average. This is defined as: Since AC varies sinusoidally with as much Position (vector) as negative doing straight average would get you zero for the average Voltage The rms value by-passes this problem. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.4|Capacitance and inductance|586
Capacitor and inductors are found in many circuits. Capacitor store an Electric field and are used as temporary Power (physics) sources as well as minimize Power (physics) fluctuations in major circuits. Inductors Work (physics) in conjunction with Capacitor for electrical signal processing. Here we explain the Physics and applications of both. 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.4.1|Capacitance|586
You have learnt about Capacitance and Capacitor in Grade 11. Please read through section 17.5 to recap what you learnt about Capacitance in DC circuit. In this section you will learn about Capacitance in an AC circuit. Capacitor in an AC circuit has reactance. Reactance in an AC circuit plays similar role to Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in DC circuit. The reactance of Capacitor XC is defined as: XC 2fC where is the Capacitance and is the AC Frequency If we examine the equation for the reactance of Capacitor we see that the Frequency is in the denominator. Therefore when the Frequency is low the Capacitance reactance is very high. This is why Capacitor blocks the flow of DC and low Frequency AC because its reactance increases with decreasing Frequency When the Frequency is high the Capacitance reactance is low. This is why Capacitor allows the flow of high Frequency AC because its reactance decreases with increasing Frequency 
---------------------------------------------------------

28.4.2|Inductance|586
An inductor is passive electrical device used in electrical circuits for its property of inductance. An inductor is usually made as coil (or solenoid) of conducting material typically copper wire wrapped around core either of air or of ferromagnetic material. Electrical Electric current through the Electrical conductor creates Magnet flux proportional to the Electric current change in this Electric current creates change in Magnet flux that in turn generates an Electromotive force that acts to oppose this change in Electric current Inductance (measured in henries symbol H) is measure of the generated Electromotive force for unit change in Electric current For example an inductor with an inductance of produces an Electromotive force of when the Electric current through the inductor changes at the rate of As1. The inductance of an inductor is determined by several factors: the shape of the coil short fat coil has higher inductance than one that is thin and tall. the material that Electrical conductor is wrapped around. how the Electrical conductor is wound winding in opposite Direction (geometry) will cancel out the inductance effect and you will have only resistor. The inductance of solenoid is defined by: 0AN2 where is the permeability of the core material (in this case air) is the cross-sectional area of the solenoid is the number of turns and is the Length of the solenoid. Definition: Permeability Permeability is the property of material which describes the magnetisation developed in that material when excited by source. The permeability of free space is 4x107 henry per Metre An inductor in an AC circuit also has reactance XL that is defined by: XL 2fL where is the inductance and is the Frequency of the AC. If we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor we see that inductive reactance increases with increasing Frequency Therefore when the Frequency is low the inductive reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low Frequency AC because its reactance decreases with decreasing Frequency When the Frequency is high the inductive reactance is high. This is why an inductor blocks the flow of high Frequency AC because its reactance increases with increasing Frequency

29.1|Introduction|591
Electron and electrical devices surround us in daily life. From the street Light and water pumps to computers and digital phones Electron have enabled the digital revolution to occur. All Electron are built on backbone of simple circuits and so an understanding of circuits is vital in understanding more complex devices. This chapter will explain the basic Physics principles of many of the components of Electron devices. We will begin with an explanation of Capacitor and inductors. We see how these are used in tuning radio. Next we look at active components such as transistors and operational amplifiers. Lastly the chapter will finish with an explanation of digital Electron including logic gates and counting circuits. Before studying this chapter you will want to remind yourself of: The meaning of Voltage (V Electric current (I) and Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance (R) as covered in Grade 10 (see chapter 10) and Grade 11 (see chapter 19). Capacitor in electric circuits as covered in Grade 11 (see section 17.6). Semiconductors as covered in Grade 11 (see chapter 20). The meaning of an alternating Electric current (see section 28.3). Capacitance (C) and Inductance (L) (see section 28.4). 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.2|Capacitive and Inductive Circuits|591
Earlier in Grade 12 you were shown alternating Electric current (a.c.) and you saw that the Voltage and the Electric current varied with time. If the a.c. supply is connected to resistor then the Electric current and Voltage will be proportional to each other. This means that the Electric current and Voltage will peak at the same time. We say that the Electric current and Voltage are in phase. This is shown in Figure 29.1. When Capacitor is connected to an alternating Voltage the maximum Voltage is proportional to the maximum Electric current but the maximum Voltage does not occur at the same time as the maximum Electric current The Electric current has its maximum (it peaks) one quarter of cycle before the Voltage peaks. Engineers say that the Electric current leads the Voltage by 90. This is shown in Figure 29.2. For circuit with Capacitor the instantaneous value of is not constant. However the value of Vmax Imax is useful and is called the Capacitance reactance (XC) of the component. Because it is still Voltage divided by Electric current (like Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance its unit is the Ohm The value of XC (C Inductors are very similar but the Electric current peaks 90 after the Voltage This is shown in Figure 29.3. Engineers say that the Electric current lags the Voltage Again the ratio of maximum Voltage to maximum Electric current is called the reactance this time inductive reactance (XL). The value of the reactance depends on its inductance (L). Definition: Reactance The ratio of the maximum Voltage to the maximum Electric current when Capacitor or inductor is connected to an alternating Voltage The unit of reactance is the Ohm While inductive and Capacitance reactances are similar in one sense they are opposites. For an inductor the Electric current peaks 90 after the Voltage For Capacitor the Electric current peaks 90 ahead of the Voltage When we Work (physics) out the total reactance for an inductor and Capacitor in series we use the formula to take this into account. This formula can also be used when there is more than one inductor or more than one Capacitor in the circuit. The total reactance is the sum of all of the inductive reactances minus the sum of all the Capacitance reactances. The magnitude (number) in the final result gives the ratio of maximum Voltage to maximum Electric current in the circuit as whole. The sign of the final result tells you its phase. If it is Position (vector) the Electric current peaks 90 after the Voltage if it is negative the Electric current peaks 90 before the Voltage If Series and parallel circuits contains resistors as well then the situation is more complicated. The maximum Electric current is still proportional to the maximum Voltage but the phase difference between them wont be 90. The ratio between the maximum Voltage and maximum Electric current is called the impedance (Z) and its unit is also the Ohm Impedances are calculated using this formula: X2 R2 (29.4) where is the total reactance of the inductors and Capacitor in the circuit and is the total Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the resistors in the circuit. It is easier to understand this formula by thinking of right angled triangle. Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance are drawn horizontally reactances are drawn vertically. The hypotenuse of the triangle gives the impedance. This is shown in Figure 29.4. Definition: Impedance The maximum Voltage divided by the maximum Electric current for any circuit. The unit of impedance is the Ohm It is important to remember that when resistors and inductances (or Capacitor are in circuit the Electric current will not be in phase with the Voltage so the impedance is not Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Similarly the Electric current wont be exactly 90 out of phase with the Voltage so the impedance isnt reactance either. Most factories containing heavy duty electrical equipment (e.g. large motors) have to pay extra money to their electricity supply company because the inductance of the motor coils causes the Electric current and Voltage to get out of phase. As this makes the electricity distribution network less efficient financial penalty is incurred. The factory engineer can prevent this by connecting Capacitor into the circuit to reduce the reactance to zero as in the last question above. The Electric current and Voltage are then in phase again. We cant calculate the Capacitance needed in this chapter because the Capacitor are usually connected in parallel and we have only covered the reactances and impedances of Series and parallel circuits 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.3|Filters and Signal Tuning|596

---------------------------------------------------------

29.3.1|Capacitors and Inductors as Filters|596
We have already seen how Capacitor and inductors pass Electric current more easily at certain Frequency than others. To recap: if we examine the equation for the reactance of Capacitor we see that the Frequency is in the denominator. Therefore when the Frequency is low the Capacitance reactance is very high. This is why Capacitor blocks the flow of DC and low Frequency AC because its reactance increases with decreasing Frequency When the Frequency is high the Capacitance reactance is low. This is why Capacitor allows the flow of high Frequency AC because its reactance decreases with increasing Frequency Therefore putting Capacitor in circuit blocks the low Frequency and allows the high Frequency to pass. This is called high pass filter. filter like this can be used in the treble setting of Sound mixer or music player which controls the amount of high Frequency signal reaching the speaker. The more high Frequency signal there is the tinnier the Sound simple high pass filter circuit is shown in Figure 29.5. Similarly if we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor we see that inductive reactance increases with increasing Frequency Therefore when the Frequency is low the inductive reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low Frequency AC because its reactance decreases with decreasing Frequency When the Frequency is high the inductive reactance is high. This is why an inductor blocks the flow of high Frequency AC because its reactance increases with increasing Frequency Therefore putting an inductor in circuit blocks the high Frequency and allows the low Frequency to pass. This is called low pass filter. filter like this can be used in the bass setting of Sound mixer or music player which controls the amount of low Frequency signal reaching the speaker. The more low Frequency signal there is the more the Sound booms. simple low pass filter circuit is shown in Figure 29.6. Figure 29.5: high pass filter. High Frequency easily pass through the Capacitor and into the next part of the circuit while low Frequency pass through the inductor straight to ground. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.3.2|LRC Circuits, Resonance and Signal Tuning|596
circuit containing resistor Capacitor and an inductor all in series is called an LRC circuit. Because the components are in series the Electric current through each component at particular time will be the same as the Electric current through the others. The Voltage across the resistor will be in phase with the Electric current The Voltage across the inductor will be 90 ahead of the Electric current (the Electric current always follows or lags the Voltage in an inductor). The Voltage across the Capacitor will be 90 behind the Electric current (the Electric current leads the Voltage for Capacitor The phases of the three Voltage are shown in Figure 29.7. Figure 29.6: low pass filter. Low Frequency pass through the inductor and into the next part of the circuit while high Frequency pass through the Capacitor straight to ground. Figure 29.7: The Voltage across the separate components of an LRC circuit. Looking at the peaks you see that the Voltage across the inductor VL peaks first followed 90 later by the Electric current followed 90 later by the Voltage across the Capacitor VC. The Voltage across the resistor is not shown it is in phase with the Electric current and peaks at the same time as the Electric current 59 The reactance of the inductor is 2fL and the reactance of the Capacitor is 12fC but with the opposite phase. So the total reactance of the LRC circuit is XL XC 2fL 2fC The impedance of the circuit as whole is given by X2 R2 2fL 2fC R2 At different Frequency the impedance will take different values. The impedance will have its smallest value when the Position (vector) inductive reactance cancels out the negative Capacitance reactance. This occurs when 2fL 2fC so the Frequency of minimum impedance must be 2LC This is called the Resonance (particle physics) Frequency of the circuit. This is the Frequency at which you can get the largest Electric current for particular supply Voltage It is also called the natural Frequency of the circuit. This means the Frequency at which the circuit would oscillate by itself. Definition: Resonance (particle physics) Resonance (particle physics) occurs when circuit is connected to an alternating Voltage at its natural fre- quency. very large Electric current in the circuit can build up even with minimal Power (physics) input. An LRC circuit is very useful when we have signal containing many different Frequency and we only want one of them. If signal like this is connected to an LRC circuit then only the Resonance (particle physics) Frequency (and other Frequency close to it) will drive measureable Electric current This means that an LRC circuit can select one Frequency from range. This process is called signal tuning. When you set up radio antenna and amplify the radio signal it receives you find many different bands of Frequency one from each radio station. When you listen to the radio you only want to listen to one station. An LRC circuit in the radio (the tuning circuit) is set so that its Resonance (particle physics) Frequency is the Frequency of the station you want to listen to. This means that of the many radio stations broadcasting you only hear one. When you adjust the tuning dial on the radio it changes the Capacitance of the Capacitor in the tuning circuit. This changes the Resonance (particle physics) Frequency and this changes the radio station that you will hear.

29.4|Active Circuit Elements|599
The components you have been learning about so far resistors Capacitor and inductors are called passive components. They do not change their behaviour or Physics in response to changes in Voltage or Electric current Active components are quite different. Their response to changes in input allows them to make amplifiers calculators and computers.

29.4.1|The Diode|599
diode is an Electron device that allows Electric current to flow in one Direction (geometry) only. diode consists of two doped semi-conductors joined together so that the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is low when connected one way and very high the other way. Figure 29.9: Operation of diode. (a) The diode is forward biased and Electric current is permitted. The negative terminal of the battery is connected to the negative terminal of the diode. (b) The diode is reverse biased and Electric current flow is not allowed. The negative terminal of the battery is connected to the Position (vector) terminal of the diode. full explanation of diode operation is complex. Here is simplified description. The diode consists of two semiconductor blocks attached together. Neither block is made of pure silicon they are both doped. Doping was described in more detail in Section 10.3. In short p-type semiconductor has fewer free Electron than normal semiconductor. stands for Position (vector) meaning lack of Electron although the material is actually neutral. The locations where Electron are missing are called holes. This material can conduct electricity well because Electron can move into the holes making new hole somewhere else in the material. Any extra Electron introduced into this region by the circuit will fill some or all of the holes. In n-type semiconductor the situation is reversed. The material has an more free Electron than normal semiconductor. stands for negative meaning an excess of Electron although the material is actually neutral. When p-type semiconductor is attached to an n-type semiconductor some of the free Electron in the n-type move across to the p-type semiconductor. They fill the available holes near the junction. This means that the region of the n-type semiconductor nearest the junction has no free Electron (theyve moved across to fill the holes). This makes this n-type semiconductor Position (vector) Electric charge It used to be Electric charge but has since lost Electron The region of p-type semiconductor nearest the junction now has no holes (theyve been filled in by the migrating Electron This makes the p-type semiconductor Electric charge It used to be Electric charge but has since gained Electron Without free Electron or holes the central region can not conduct electricity well. It has high Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance and is called the depletion band. This is shown in Figure 29.10. You can explain the high Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance in different way. free Electron in the n-type semiconductor will be repelled from the p-type semiconductor because of its Electric charge The Electron will not go into the depletion band and certainly wont cross the band to the p-type semiconductor. You may ask But wont free Electron in the p-type semiconductor be attracted across the band carrying Electric current But there are no free Electron in p-type semiconductor so no Electric current of this kind can flow. If the diode is reverse-biased the terminal of the battery is connected to the n-type semiconductor. This makes it even more Electric charge It also removes even more of the free Electron near the depletion band. At the same time the terminal of the battery is connected to the p-type silicon. This will supply free Electron and fill in more of the holes next to the depletion band. Both processes cause the depletion band to get wider. The Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the diode (which was already high) increases. This is why reverse-biased diode does not conduct. Another explanation for the increased Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance is that the battery has made the p-type semiconductor more negative than it used to be making it repel any Electron from the n-type semiconductor which attempt to cross the depletion band. On the other hand if the diode is forward biased the depletion band is made narrower. The Electric charge on the p-type silicon is cancelled out by the battery. The greater the Voltage used the narrower the depletion band becomes. Eventually when the Voltage is about 06 (for silicon) the depletion band disappears. Once this has occurred the diode conducts very well. Figure 29.10: diode consists of two doped semi-conductors joined together so that the resis- tance is low when connected one way and very high the other way.

29.4.2|The Light Emitting Diode (LED)|601
light-emitting diode (LED) is diode device that emits Light when Electric charge flows in the correct Direction (geometry) through it. If you apply Voltage to Force Electric current to flow in the Direction (geometry) the LED allows it will Light up. Extension: Circuit Symbols This notation of having two small arrows pointing away from the device is common to the schematic symbols of all light-emitting semiconductor devices. Conversely if device is light-activated (meaning that incoming Light stimulates it) then the symbol will have two small arrows pointing toward it. It is interesting to note though that LEDs are capable of acting as light-sensing devices: they will generate small Voltage when exposed to Light much like solar cell on small scale. This property can be gainfully applied in variety of light-sensing circuits. The Color depends on the semiconducting material used to construct the LED and can be in the near-ultraviolet visible or infrared part of the Electromagnetic spectrum Nick Holonyak Jr. (1928 of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed the first practical visible-spectrum LED in 1962. Light Emission spectrum The Wavelength of the Light emitted and therefore its Color depends on the materials forming the p-n junction. normal diode typically made of silicon or germanium emits invisible far-infrared Light (so it cant be seen) but the materials used for an LED have emit Light corresponding to near-infrared visible or near-ultraviolet Frequency LED applications LEDs have many uses. Some of these are given here. thin lightweight message displays e.g. in public information signs (at airports and railway stations among other places) status indicators e.g. onoff Light on professional instruments and consumers audiovideo equipment infrared LEDs in remote controls (for TVs VCRs etc) clusters of LEDs are used in traffic signals replacing ordinary bulbs behind Color glass car indicator Light and bicycle Light calculator and measurement instrument displays (seven segment displays) although now mostly replaced by LCDs red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and alphanumeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits submarine and ship bridges astronomy observatories and in the Field (physics) e.g. night time animal watching and military Field (physics) use red or yellow LEDs are also used in photographic darkrooms for providing Light which does not lead to unwanted exposure of the film illumination e.g. flashlights (a.k.a. torches UK) and backlighting for LCD screens signalingemergency beacons and strobes movement sensors e.g. in mechanical and Geometrical optics computer mice and trackballs in LED printers e.g. high-end Color printers LEDs offer benefits in terms of maintenance and safety. The typical Work (physics) lifetime of device including the bulb is ten years which is much longer than the lifetimes of most other Light sources. LEDs fail by dimming over time rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs. LEDs give off less heat than incandescent Light bulbs and are less fragile than fluorescent lamps. Since an individual device is smaller than centimetre in Length LED-based Light sources used for illumination and outdoor signals are built using clusters of tens of devices. Because they are monochromatic LED Light have great Power (physics) advantages over white Light where specific Color is required. Unlike the white Light the LED does not need filter that absorbs most of the emitted white Light Color fluorescent Light are made but they are not widely available. LED Light are inherently Color and are available in wide range of Color One of the most recently introduced Color is the emerald green (bluish green about 500 nm) that meets the legal requirements for traffic signals and navigation Light There are applications that specifically require Light that does not contain any blue component. Examples are photographic darkroom safe Light illumination in laboratories where certain photo-sensitive chemicals are used and situations where dark adaptation (night vision) must be preserved such as cockpit and bridge illumination observatories etc. Yellow LED Light are good choice to meet these special requirements because the human eye is more sensitive to yellow Light 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.4.3|Transistor|603
The diode is the simplest semiconductor device made up of p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor in contact. It can conduct in only one Direction (geometry) but it cannot control the size of an electric Electric current Transistors are more complicated Electron components which can control the size of the electric Electric current flowing through them. This enables them to be used in amplifiers. small signal from microphone or radio antenna can be used to control the transistor. In response the transistor will then increase and decrease much larger Electric current which flows through the speakers. One of the earliest popular uses of transistors was in cheap and portable radios. Before that radios were much more expensive and contained glass valves which were fragile and needed replacing. In some parts of the world you can still hear people talking about their transistor they mean their portable radio. You can also use small Electric current to turn the transistor on and off. The transistor then controls more complicated or Power (physics) Electric current through other components. When transistor is used in this way it is said to be in switching mode as it is acting as remotely controlled switch. As we shall see in the final sections of this chapter switching circuits can be used in computer to process and store digital information. computer would not Work (physics) without the millions (or billions) of transistors in it. There are two main types of transistor bipolar transistors (NPN or PNP) and Field (physics) effect transistors (FETs). Both use doped semiconductors but in different ways. You are mainly required to know about Field (physics) effect transistors (FETs) however we have to give brief description of bipolar transistors so that you see the difference. Bipolar Transistors Bipolar transistors are made of doped semiconductor sandwich. In an NPN transistor very thin layer of p-type semiconductor is in between two thicker layers of n-type semiconductor. This is shown in Figure 29.11. Similarly an PNP transistor consists of very thin n-type layer in between two thicker layers of p-type semiconductor. In an NPN transistor small Electric current of Electron flows from the emitter (E) to the base (B). Simultaneously much larger Electric current of Electron flows from the emitter (E) to the collector (C). If you lower the number of Electron able to leave the transistor at the base (B) the transistor automatically reduces the number of Electron flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C). Similarly if you increase the Electric current of Electron flowing out of the base (B) the transistor automatically also increases the Electric current of Electron flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C). The transistor is designed so that the Electric current of Electron from emitter to collector (IEC) is proportional to the Electric current of Electron from emitter to base (IEB). The constant of proportionality is known as the Electric current gain So IEC IEB. How does it do it? The answer comes from our Work (physics) with diodes. Electron arriving at the emitter (n-type semiconductor) will naturally flow through into the central p-type since the base-emitter junction is forward biased. However if none of these Electron are removed from the base the Electron flowing into the base from the emitter will fill all of the available holes. Accordingly large depletion band will be set up. This will act as an Insulator (electricity) preventing Electric current flow into the collector as well. On the other hand if the base is connected to Position (vector) Voltage small number of Electron will be removed by the base connection. This will prevent the holes in the base becoming filled up and no depletion band will form. While some Electron from the emitter leave via the base connection the bulk of them flow straight on to the collector. You may wonder how the Electron get from the base into the collector (it seems to be reverse biased). The answer is complicated but the important fact is that the p-type layer is extremely thin. As long as there is no depletion layer the bulk of the Electron will have no difficulty passing straight from the n-type emitter into the n-type collector. more satisfactory answer can be given to university student once band theory has been explained. Summing up in an NPN transistor small flow of Electron from emitter (E) to base (B) allows much larger flow of Electron from emitter (E) to collector (C). Given that conventional Electric current (flowing from to is in the opposite Direction (geometry) to Electron flow we say that small conventional Electric current from base to emitter allows large Electric current to flow from collector to emitter. PNP transistor Work (physics) the other way. small conventional Electric current from emitter to base allows much larger conventional Electric current to flow from emitter to collector. The operation is more complicated to explain since the principal Electric charge carrier in PNP transistor is not the Electron but the hole. The operation of NPN and PNP transistors (in terms of conventional Electric current is summarized in Figure 29.12. The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest discoveries or inventions in modern history ranking with banking and the printing press. Key to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be produced in huge numbers using simple techniques resulting in vanishingly small prices. Computer chips consist of millions of transistors and sell for Rands with per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents. The low cost has meant that the transistor has become an almost universal tool for non-mechanical tasks. Whereas common device say refrigerator would have used mechanical device for control today it is often less expensive to simply use few million transistors and the appropriate computer program to carry out the same task through brute Force Today transistors have replaced almost all electromechanical devices most simple feedback systems and appear in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars. The transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories in December 1947 (first demonstrated on December 23) by John Bardeen Walter Houser Brattain and William Bradford Shockley who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956. The Field (physics) Effect Transistor (FET) To control bipolar transistors you control the Electric current flowing into or out of its base. The other type of transistor is the Field (physics) effect transistor (FET). FETs Work (physics) using control Voltage instead. Accordingly they can be controlled with much smaller Electric current and are much more economic to use. No-one would build computer with billions of bipolar transistors the Electric current in each transistors base might be small but when you add up all of the base Electric current in the millions of transistors the computer as whole would be consuming great deal of electricity and making great deal of heat. Not only is this wasteful it would prevent manufacturers making computer of convenient size. If the transistors were too close together they would overheat. Figure 29.13: Field (physics) effect transistor (FET). The diagram on the left shows the semiconductor structure. The diagram on the right shows its circuit symbol. The three terminals of the FET are called the source (S) drain (D) and gate (G) as shown in Figure 29.13. When the gate is not connected Electric current of Electron can flow from source (S) to drain (D) easily along the channel. The source is accordingly the negative terminal of the transistor. The drain where the Electron come out is the Position (vector) terminal of the transistor. few Electron will flow from the n-type channel into the p-type semiconductor of the gate when the device is manufactured. However as these Electron are not removed (the gate is not connected) depletion band is set up which prevents further flow into the gate. In operation the gate is connected to negative Voltage relative to the source. This makes the p-n junction between gate and channel reverse-biased. Accordingly no Electric current flows from the source into the gate. When the Voltage of the gate is lowered (made more negative) the depletion band becomes wider. This enlarged depletion band takes up some of the space of the channel. So the lower the Voltage of the gate (the more negative it is relative to the source) the larger the depletion band. The larger the depletion band the narrower the channel. The narrower the channel the harder it is for Electron to flow from source to drain. The Voltage of the gate is not the only factor affecting the Electric current of Electron between the source and the drain. If the external circuit has low Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Electron are able to leave the drain easily. If the external circuit has high Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance Electron leave the drain slowly. This creates kind of traffic jam which slows the passage of further Electron In this way the Voltage of the drain regulates itself and is more or less independent of the Electric current demanded from the drain. Once these two factors have been taken into account it is fair to say that the Position (vector) output Voltage (the Voltage of the drain relative to the source) is proportional to the negative input Voltage (the Voltage of the gate relative to the source). For this reason the Field (physics) effect transistor is known as Voltage amplifier. This contrasts with the bipolar transistor which is Electric current amplifier. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.4.4|The Operational Amplifier|607
The operational amplifier is special kind of Voltage amplifier which is made from handful of bipolar or Field (physics) effect transistors. Operational amplifiers are usually called op-amps for short. They are used extensively in all kinds of audio equipment (amplifiers mixers and so on) and in instrumentation. They also have many other uses in other circuit for example comparing Voltage from sensors. Operational amplifiers are supplied on Integrated Circuits (I.C.s). The most famous operational amplifier I.C. is numbered 741 and contains single operational amplifier on an integrated circuit (chip) with eight terminals. Other varieties can be bought and you can get single integrated circuit with two or four 741-type operational amplifiers on it. The symbol for an op-amp is shown in Figure 29.14. The operational amplifier has two input terminals and one output terminal. The Voltage of the output terminal is proportional to the difference in Voltage between the two input terminals. The output terminal is on the right (at the sharp point of the triangle). The two input terminals are drawn on the left. One input terminal (labelled with on diagrams) is called the non-inverting input. The other input terminal (labelled is called the inverting input. The labels and have nothing to do with the way in which the operational amplifier is connected to the Power (physics) supply. Operational amplifiers must be connected to the Power (physics) supply but this is taken for granted when circuit diagrams are drawn and these connections are not shown on circuit diagrams. Usually when drawing Electron circuits 0V is taken to mean the negative terminal of the Power (physics) supply. This is not the case with op-amps. For an op-amp 0V refers to the Voltage midway between the and of the supply. The output Voltage of the amplifier Vout is given by the formula here is constant called the open loop gain and V+ and are the Voltage of the two input terminals. That said the output Voltage can not be less than the Voltage of the negative terminal of the battery supplying it or higher than the Position (vector) terminal of the battery supplying it. You will notice that Vout is Position (vector) if V+ and negative if V+ V. This is why the input is called the inverting input: raising its Voltage causes the output Voltage to drop. The input Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of an operational amplifier is very high. This means that very little Electric current flows into the input terminals during operation. If all of the transistors in the operational amplifier were identical then the output Voltage would be zero if the two inputs were at equal Voltage In practice this is not quite the case and for sensitive Work (physics) trimming potentiometer is connected. This is adjusted until the op-amp is zeroed correctly. Simple operational amplifiers require the trimming potentiometer to be built into the circuit containing them and an example is shown in Figure 29.15. Other operational amplifier designs incorporate separate terminals for the trimming potentiometer. These special terminals are labelled offset on the manufacturers diagram. The exact method of connecting the potentiometer to the offset terminals can depend on the design of the operational amplifier and you need to refer to the manufacturers data sheet for details of which potentiometer to use and how to connect it. For most commercially produced operational amplifiers (known as op-amps for short) the open loop gain is very large and does not stay constant. Values of 100 000 are typical. Usually designer would want an amplifier with stable gain of smaller value and builds the operational amplifier into circuit like the one in Figure 29.15. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.5|The Principles of Digital Electronics|609
The circuits and components we have discussed are very useful. You can build radio or television with them. You can make telephone. Even if that was all there was to Electron it would still be very useful. However the great breakthrough in the last fifty years or so has been in digital Electron This is the subject which gave us the computer. The computer has revolutionized the way business engineering and science are done. Small computers programmed to do specific job (called microprocessors) are now used in almost every Electron machine from cars to washing machines. Computers have also changed the way we communicate. We used to have telegraph or telephone wires passing up and down country each one carrying one telephone call or signal. We now have Geometrical optics fibres each capable of carrying tens of thousands of telephone calls using digital signals. So what is digital signal? Look at Figure 29.16. normal signal called an analogue signal carries smooth Wave At any time the Voltage of the signal could take any value. It could be 200 or 353 or anything else. digital signal can only take certain Voltage The simplest case is shown in the figure the Voltage takes one of two values. It is either high or it is low. It never has any other value. These two special Voltage are given symbols. The low Voltage level is written while the high Voltage level is written as 1. When you send digital signal you set the Voltage you want (0 or 1) then keep this fixed for fixed amount of time (for example 0.01 s) then you send the next or 1. The digital signal in Figure 29.16 could be written 01100101. Why are digital signals so good? Figure 29.16: The difference between normal (analogue) signals and digital signals. The analogue signal is on the left. 1. Using computer any information can be turned into pattern of 0s and 1s. Pictures recorded music text and Motion pictures can all be turned into string of 0s and 1s and transmitted or stored in the same way. The computer receiving the signal at the other end converts it back again. Compact Disc (CD) for example can store music or text or pictures and all can be read using computer. 2. The and the look very different. You can immediately tell if or is being sent. Even if there is interference you can still tell whether the sender sent or 1. This means that fewer mistakes are made when reading digital signal. This is why the best music recording technologies and the most modern cameras for example all use digital technology. 3. Using the 0s and 1s you can count and do all kinds of mathematics. This will be explained in more detail in the next section. The simplest digital circuits are called logic gates. Each logic gate makes decision based on the information it receives. Different logic gates are set up to make the decisions in different ways. Each logic gate will be made of many Optical microscope transistors connected together within thin wafer of silicon. This tiny circuit is called an Integrated Circuit or I.C. all the parts are in one place (integrated) on the silicon wafer. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.5.1|Logic Gates|610
There are five main types of logic gate: NOT AND OR NAND and NOR. Each one makes its decision in different way. The NOT Gate Problem: You want an automatic circuit in your office to turn on the heating in the winter. You already have digital Electron Temperature sensor. When the Temperature is high it sends out 1. When the office is cold it sends out 0. If this signal were sent straight to the heater the heater would turn on (1) when it was already hot and would stay off when it was cold. This is wrong To make the heater Work (physics) we need circuit which will change (from the sensor) into (to send to the heater). This will make the heater come on when it is cold. You also want it to change (from the sensor) into (to send to the heater). This will turn the heater off when the room is hot. This circuit is called an inverter or NOT gate. It changes into (1 is NOT 0). It changes into (0 is NOT 1). It changes signal into what it is NOT. The symbol for the NOT gate is: The action of the NOT gate is written in table called truth table. The left column shows the possible inputs on different rows. The right column shows what the output (decision) of the circuit will be for that input. The truth table for the NOT gate is shown below. When you read the truth table the top row says If the input is the output will be 1. For our heater this means If the room is cold the heater will turn on. The bottom row says If the input is the output will be 0. For our heater this means If the room is hot the heater will switch off. The AND Gate Problem: An airliner has two toilets. Passengers get annoyed if they get up from their seat only to find that both toilets are being used and they have to go back to their seat and wait. You want to fit an automatic circuit to Light up display if both toilets are in use. Then passengers know that if the Light is off there will be free toilet for them to use. There is sensor in each toilet. It gives out of the toilet is free and if it is in use. You want to send to the display unit if both sensors are sending 1s. To do this you use an AND gate. The symbol for the AND gate is: The truth table for the AND gate is shown below. An AND gate has two inputs (the NOT gate only had one). This means we need four rows in the truth table one for each possible set of inputs. The first row for example tells us what the AND gate will do if both inputs are 0. In our airliner this means that both toilets are free. The right column has showing that the output will be so the display will not Light up. The second row has inputs of and (the first toilet is free the other is in use). Again the output is 0. The third row tells us what will happen if the inputs are and (the first toilet is in use and the second is free). Finally the last line tells us what will happen if both inputs are (both toilets are in use). It is only in this case that the output is and the display Light up. This device is called an AND gate because the output is only if one input AND the other input are both 1. Extension: Using and to mean True and False When we use logic gates we use the low Voltage state to represent false. The high Voltage state represents true. This is why the word AND is so appropriate. AND is true (1) if and only if is true (1) AND is true (1). Extension: AND and multiplication Sometimes the AND operation is written as multiplication. AND is written AB. If either or are then AB will also be 0. For AB to be we need and to both be 1. Multiplication of the numbers and does exactly the same job as an AND gate. The NAND Gate Problem: You build the circuit for the airliner toilets using an AND gate. Your customer is pleased but she says that it would be better if the display lit up when there was free toilet. In other words the display should Light up unless both toilets are in use. To do this we want circuit which does the opposite of an AND gate. We want circuit which would give the output if an AND gate would give 1. We want circuit which would give the output if an AND gate would give 0. This circuit is called NAND gate. The symbol for the NAND gate is: You may have noticed that we could have done this job on the airliner by using our earlier circuit with NOT gate added between the original AND gate and the display. This is where the word NAND comes from it is short for NotAND. The OR Gate Problem: long dark corridor has two Light switches one at each end of the corridor. The switches each send an output of to the control unit if no-one has pressed the switch. If someone presses the switch its output is 1. The Light in the corridor should come on if either switch is pressed. To do this job the control unit needs an OR gate. The symbol for the OR gate is: The truth table for the OR gate is shown. You can see that the output is (and the Light come on in the corridor) if either one switch OR the other is pressed. Pressing both switches also turns on the Light as the last row in the table shows. Extension: OR and addition Sometimes you will see OR written mathematically as A+B. This makes sense since if A0 and B0 then OR A+B 0. Similarly if A0 and B1 then OR A+B 1. If A1 and B0 then OR A+B once again. The only case where the OR function differs from normal addition is when A1 and B1. Here OR in logic but A+B2 in arithmetic. However there is no such thing as in logic so we define to mean OR and write 1+11 with impunity If you wish you can prove that the normal rules of algebra still Work (physics) using this notation: A+(B+C) (A+B)+C A(BC) (AB)C and A(B+C) AB AC. This special kind of algebra where variables can only be (representing false) or (representing true) is called Boolean algebra. The NOR Gate The last gate you need to know is the NOR gate. This is opposite to the OR gate. The output is if both inputs are 0. In other words the output switches on if neither the first NOR the second input is 1. The symbol for the NOR gate is: The truth table for the NOR gate is shown below. The examples given were easy. Each job only needed one logic gate. However any decision making circuit can be built with logic gates no matter how complicated the decision. Here is an example. Each logic gate is manufactured from two or more transistors. Other circuits can be made using logic gates as we shall see in the next section. We shall show you how to count and store numbers using logic gates. This means that if you have enough transistors and you connect them correctly to make the right logic gates you can make circuits which count and store numbers. In practice the cheapest gate to manufacture is usually the NAND gate. Additionally Charles Peirce showed that NAND gates alone (as well as NOR gates alone) can be used to reproduce all the other logic gates. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.6|Using and Storing Binary Numbers|616
In the previous section we saw how the numbers and could represent false and true and could be used in decision making. Often we want to program computer to count with numbers. To do this we need way of writing any number using nothing other than and 1. When written in this way numbers are called binary numbers. Definition: Binary way of writing any number using only the digits and 1. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.6.1|Binary numbers|616
In normal (denary) numbers we write 9+1 as 10. The fact that the in 10 is the second digit from the right tells us that it actually means 10 and not 1. Similarly the in 365 represents 300 because it is the third digit from the right. You could write 365 as 100 10 5. You will notice the pattern that the nth digit from the right represents 10n1. In binary we use the nth digit from the right to represent 2n1. Thus is written as 10 in binary. Similarly 22 is written as 100 in binary and 23 is written as 1000 in binary. How do you write numbers as sum of Power (physics) of two? The first Power (physics) of two (the largest) is the largest Power (physics) of two which is not larger than the number you are Work (physics) with. In our last example where we wanted to know what twelve was in binary the largest Power (physics) of two which is not larger than 12 is 8. Thus 12 something. By arithmetic the something must be and the largest Power (physics) of two not larger than this is exactly. Thus 12 and we have finished. more complicated example would be to write one hundred in binary. The largest Power (physics) of two not larger than 100 is 64 (1000000 in binary). Subtracting 64 from 100 leaves 36. The largest Power (physics) of two not larger than 36 is 32 (100000 in binary). Removing this leaves remainder of which is Power (physics) of two itself (100 in binary). Thus one hundred is 64 32 or in binary 1000000 100000 100 1100100. Once number is written in binary it can be represented using the low and high Voltage levels of digital Electron We demonstrate how this is done by showing you how an Electron counter Work (physics) 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.6.2|Counting circuits|617
To make counter you need several flip flops sometimes called divide by two circuits. flip flop is digital circuit which swaps its output (from to or from to 0) whenever the input changes from to 0. When the input changes from to it doesnt change its output. It is called flip flop because it changes (flips or flops) each time it receives pulse. If you put series of pulses 10101010 into flip flop the result is 01100110. Figure 29.18 makes this clearer. As you can see from Figure 29.18 there are half as many pulses in the output. This is why it is called divide by two circuit. If we connect flip flops in chain then we make counter which can count pulses. As an example we connect three flip flops in chain. This is shown in Figure 29.19. When this circuit is fed with stream of pulses the outputs of the different stages change. The table below shows how this happens. Each row shows different stage with the first stage at the top. We assume that all of the flip flops have as their output to start with. Figure 29.18: The output of flip flop or divide by two circuit when square Wave is connected to the input. The output changes state when the input goes from to 0. Figure 29.19: Three flip flops connected together in chain to make counter. The input of each flip flop is labelled while each output is labelled Electric charge The pulses are connected to the input on the left. The outputs Electric charge Electric charge and Electric charge give the three digits of the binary number as the pulses are counted. This is explained in the text and in the next table. The binary numbers in the right hand column count the pulses arriving at the input. You will notice that the output of the first flip flop gives the right most digit of the pulse count (in binary). The output of the second flip flop gives the second digit from the right (the twos digit) of the pulse count. The output of the third flip flop gives the third digit from the right (the fours digit) of the pulse count. As there are only three flip flops there is nothing to provide the next digit (the eights digit) and so the eighth pulse is recorded as 000 not 1000. This device is called modulo counter because it can count in eight stages from 000 to 111 before it goes back to 000. If you put four flip flops in the counter it will count in sixteen stages from 0000 to 1111 and it is called modulo 16 counter because it counts in sixteen stages before going back to 0000. Definition: Modulo The modulo of counter tells you how many stages (or pulses) it receives before going back to as its output. Thus modulo counter counts in eight stages 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 then returns to 000 again. 
---------------------------------------------------------

29.6.3|Storing binary numbers|619
Counting is important. However it is equally important to be able to remember the numbers. Computers can convert almost anything to string of 0s and 1s and therefore to binary number. Unless this number can be stored in the computers memory the computer would be useless. The memory in the computer contains many parts. Each part is able to store single or 1. Since and are the two binary digits we say that each part of the memory stores one bit. Figure 29.20: bistable circuit made from two NOR gates. This circuit is able to store one bit of digital information. With the two inputs set to you can see that the output could be (and will remain) either or 1. The circuit on the left shows an output of the circuit on the right shows an output of 1. Wires carrying high logic levels (1) are drawn thicker. The output of the bistable is labelled Electric charge Definition: Bit One bit is short way of saying one binary digit. It is single or 1. If you have eight bits you can store binary number from 00000000 to 11111111 (0 to 255 in denary). This gives you enough permutations of 0s and 1s to have one for each letter of the alphabet (in upper and lower case) each digit from to each punctuation mark and each control code used by computer in storing document. When you type text into word processor each character is stored as set of eight bits. Each set of eight bits is called byte. Computer memories are graded according to how many bytes they store. There are 1024 bytes in kilobyte (kB) 1024 1024 bytes in megabyte (MB) and 1024 1024 1024 bytes in gigabyte (GB). To store bit we need circuit which can remember or 1. This is called bistable circuit because it has two stable states. It can stay indefinitely either as or 1. An example of bistable circuit is shown in Figure 29.20. It is made from two NOR gates. To store the or the in the bistable circuit you set one of the inputs to then put it back to again. If the input labelled (set) is raised the output will immediately become 1. This is shown in Figure 29.21. To store you raise the (reset) input to 1. This is shown in Figure 29.22. Once you have used the or inputs to set or reset the bistable circuit you then bring both inputs back to 0. The bistable remembers the state. Because of the ease with which the circuit can be Reset and Set it is also called RS flip flop circuit. computer memory will be able to store millions or billions of bits. If it used our circuit above it would need millions or billions of NOR gates each of which is made from several transistors. The computer memory is made of many millions of transistors. The bistable circuits drawn here dont remember 0s or 1s for ever they lose the information if the Power (physics) is turned off. The same is true for the RAM (Random Access Memory) used to store Work (physics) and temporary data in computer. Some modern circuits contain special memory which can remember its state even if the Power (physics) is turned off. This is used in FLASH drives commonly found in USB data sticks and on the memory cards used with digital cameras. These bistable circuits are much more complex. You can also make flip flops out of logic gates however these are more complicated to design.

30|EM Radiation|625

---------------------------------------------------------

30.1|Introduction|625
This chapter will focus on the electromagnetic Electromagnetic radiation Electromagnetic radiation is self-propagating Wave in space with electric and Magnet components. These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the Direction (geometry) of propagation and are in phase with each other. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the Frequency of the Wave these types include in order of increasing Frequency radio Wave microwaves infrared radiation visible Light ultraviolet radiation X-rays and gamma Ray (optics) 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.2|Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation|625
If you watch colony of ants walking up the wall they look like thin continuous black line. But as you look closer you see that the line is made up of thousands of separated black ants. Light and all other types of Electromagnetic radiation seems like continuous Wave at first but when one performs experiments on the Light one can notice that the Light can have both Wave and particle like properties. Just like the individual ants the Light can also be made up of individual bundles of Energy or quanta of Light Light has both wave-like and particle-like properties (waveparticle duality) but only shows one or the other depending on the kind of experiment we perform. wave-type experiment shows the Wave nature and particle-type experiment shows particle nature. One cannot test the Wave and the particle nature at the same time. particle of Light is called photon. Definition: Photon photon is Energy level packet) of Light The particle nature of Light can be demonstrated by the interaction of photons with matter. One way in which Light interacts with matter is via the Photoelectric effect which will be studied in detail in Chapter 31. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.3|The wave nature of electromagnetic radiation|626
Accelerating Electric charge emit electromagnetic Wave We have seen that changing Electric field generates Magnet Field (physics) and changing Magnet Field (physics) generates an Electric field This is the principle behind the propagation of electromagnetic Wave because electromagnetic Wave unlike Sound Wave do not need medium to travel through. EM Wave propagate when an Electric field oscillating in one plane produces Magnet Field (physics) oscillating in plane at right angles to it which produces an oscillating Electric field and so on. The propagation of electromagnetic Wave can be described as mutual induction. These mutually regenerating Field (physics) travel through space at constant Speed of 108m s1 represented by c. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.4|Electromagnetic spectrum|626
Observe the things around you your friend sitting next to you large tree across the Field (physics) How is it that you are able to see these things? What is it that is leaving your friends arm and entering your eye so that you can see his arm? It is Light The Light originally comes from the sun or possibly Light bulb or burning fire. In Physics Light is given the more technical term Electromagnetic radiation which includes all forms of Light not just the form which you can see with your eyes. Electromagnetic radiation allows us to observe the world around us. It is this radiation which Reflection (physics) off of the objects around you and into your eye. The radiation your eye is sensitive to is only small fraction of the total radiation emitted in the Physics universe. All of the different fractions taped together make up the Electromagnetic spectrum When white Light is split into its component Color by prism you are looking at portion of the Electromagnetic spectrum The Wavelength of particular Electromagnetic radiation will depend on how it was created. The radiation can take on any Wavelength which means that the spectrum is continuous. Physicists broke down this continuous band into sections. Each section is defined by how the radiation is created not the radiations Wavelength But each category is continuous within the min and max Wavelength of that category meaning there are no Wavelength excluded within some range. The spectrum is in order of Wavelength with the shortest Wavelength at one end and the longest Wavelength at the other. The spectrum is then broken down into categories as detailed in Table 30.1. Since an electromagnetic Wave is still Wave the following equation that you learnt in Grade 10 still applies: In theory the spectrum is infinite although realistically we can only observe Wavelength from few hundred kilometers to those of gamma Ray (optics) due to experimental limitations. Humans experience electromagnetic Wave differently depending on their Wavelength Our eyes are sensitive to visible Light while our skin is sensitive to infrared and many Wavelength we do not detect at all. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.5|The particle nature of electromagnetic radiation|629
When we talk of Electromagnetic radiation as particle we refer to photons which are packets of Energy The Energy of the photon is related to the Wavelength of Electromagnetic radiation according to: is called Plancks constant. Definition: Plancks constant Plancks constant is Physics constant named after Max Planck. 6626 1034 The Energy of photon can be calculated using the formula: hf or Where is the Energy of the photon in Joule (J) is plancks constant is the Speed of Light is the Frequency in Hertz Hertz and is the Wavelength in Metre (m). 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.6|Penetrating ability of electromagnetic radiation|631
Different kinds of Electromagnetic radiation have different penetrabilities. For example if we take the human body as the object. Infrared Light is emitted by the human body. Visible Light is Reflection (physics) off the surface of the human body ultra-violet Light (from sunlight) damages the skin but X-rays are able to penetrate the skin and bone and allows for pictures of the inside of the human body to be taken. If we compare the Energy of visible Light to the Energy of X-rays we find that X-rays have much higher Energy Usually kinds of Electromagnetic radiation with higher Energy have higher penetrabilities than those with low Energy Certain kinds of Electromagnetic radiation such as ultra-violet radiation X-rays and gamma Ray (optics) are very dangerous. Radiation such as these are called ionising radiation. Ionising radiation loses Energy as it passes through matter breaking molecular bonds and creating ions. Excessive exposure to radiation including sunlight X-rays and all nuclear radiations can cause destruction of biological tissue. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.6.1|Ultraviolet(UV) radiation and the skin|631
UVA and UVB are different ranges of Frequency for ultraviolet (UV) Light UVA and UVB can damage collagen fibres which results in the Speed up skin aging. In general UVA is the least harmful but it can contribute to the aging of skin DNA damage and possibly skin cancer. It penetrates deeply and does not cause sunburn. Because it does not cause reddening of the skin (erythema) it cannot be measured in the SPF testing. There is no good clinical measurement of the blocking of UVA radiation but it is important that sunscreen block both UVA and UVB. UVB Light can cause skin cancer. The radiation excites DNA molecules in skin cells resulting in possible mutations which can cause cancer. This cancer connection is one reason for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole. As defense against UV radiation the body tans when exposed to moderate (depending on skin type) levels of radiation by releasing the brown Pigment melanin. This helps to block UV penetration and prevent damage to the vulnerable skin tissues deeper down. Suntan lotion often referred to as sunblock or sunscreen partly blocks UV and is widely available. Most of these products contain an SPF rating that describes the amount of protection given. This protection however applies only to UVB Ray (optics) responsible for sunburn and not to UVA Ray (optics) that penetrate more deeply into the skin and may also be responsible for causing cancer and wrinkles. Some sunscreen lotion now includes compounds such as titanium dioxide which helps protect against UVA Ray (optics) Other UVA blocking compounds found in sunscreen include zinc oxide and avobenzone. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.6.2|Ultraviolet radiation and the eyes|632
High intensities of UVB Light are hazardous to the eyes and exposure can cause welders flash (photo keratitis or arc eye) and may lead to cataracts pterygium and pinguecula formation. Protective eyewear is beneficial to those who are Work (physics) with or those who might be exposed to ultraviolet radiation particularly short Wave UV. Given that Light may reach the eye from the sides full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure as in high altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of UV radiation both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of Reflection (physics) from snow and ice. Ordinary untreated eyeglasses give some protection. Most Plasticity (physics) lenses give more protection than glass lenses. Some Plasticity (physics) lens materials such as polycarbonate block most UV. There are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it which will give better protection. But even treatment that completely blocks UV will not protect the eye from Light that arrives around the lens. To convince yourself of the potential dangers of stray UV Light cover your lenses with something opaque like aluminum foil stand next to bright Light and consider how much Light you see despite the complete blockage of the lenses. Most contact lenses help to protect the retina by absorbing UV radiation. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.6.3|X-rays|632
While x-rays are used significantly in medicine prolonged exposure to X-rays can lead to cell damage and cancer. For example mammogram is an x-ray of the human breast to detect breast cancer but if woman starts having regular mammograms when she is too young her chances of getting breast cancer increases. 
---------------------------------------------------------

30.6.4|Gamma-rays|632
Due to the high Energy of gamma-rays they are able to cause serious damage when absorbed by living cells. Gamma-rays are not stopped by the skin and can induce DNA alteration by Interference (wave propagation) with the genetic material of the cell. DNA double-strand breaks are generally accepted to be the most biologically significant lesion by which ionising radiation causes cancer and hereditary disease. study done on Russian nuclear workers exposed to external whole-body gamma-radiation at high cumulative doses shows link between radiation exposure and death from leukaemia lung liver skeletal and other solid cancers. Extension: Cellphones and Electromagnetic radiation Cellphone radiation and health concerns have been raised especially following the enormous increase in the use of wireless mobile telephony throughout the world. This is because mobile phones use electromagnetic Wave in the microwave range. These concerns have induced large body of research. Concerns about effects on health have also been raised regarding other digital wireless systems such as data communication networks. The World Health Organization has officially ruled out adverse health effects from cellular base stations and wireless data networks and expects to make recommendations about mobile phones in 2007-08. Cellphone users are recommended to minimise radiation by for example: 1. Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head. 2. Keep the mobile phone away from the body. 3. Do not telephone in car without an external antenna. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31|Optical Phenomena and Properties of Matter|635

---------------------------------------------------------

31.1|Introduction|635
For centuries physicists argued about whether Light was particle or Wave It was assumed that Light could only be one or the other but not both. In earlier chapters on Wave (Chapters 24 25 26) and Geometrical optics (Chapters and 13) you studied how Light or other Electromagnetic radiation propagates like Wave The Wave nature of Light of was demonstrated by the propagation of Light in examples such as Diffraction interference and polarisation of Light You also saw in Chapter 30 on Electromagnetic radiation how Light sometimes behaves as particle. This chapter looks at evidence supporting the particle model of Light The idea that Light can have both Wave and particle properties was one of the most important discoveries of the twentieth century. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.2|The transmission and scattering of light|635

---------------------------------------------------------

31.2.1|Energy levels of an electron|635
We have seen that the Electron in an atom have different Energy level When the Electron receives enough Energy it can jump up to higher Energy level This is called exciting the Electron When the Electron in high Energy level sheds some Energy it drops to lower Energy level We have also seen that the Energy associated with Light at specific Wavelength is given by: hc In the particle model of Light this means that each packet of Light (photon) at Wavelength has Energy hc For the Electron to receive Energy it absorbs photon and gets its Energy When an Electron loses Energy to drop to lower level it emits (gives off) photon with that Energy 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.2.2|Interaction of light with metals|636
When Light encounters or passes through material the photons of the Light interact with the atoms or molecules of the material. Depending on the Strength of materials of the interactions and how often they happen the Light will pass through the material or be Scattering in some other Direction (geometry) Each Wavelength of Light relates to particular Energy and the closer that Energy is to the Energy difference between two of the levels of the atom the likelier the photon is to interact with the atom. When visible or ultraviolet (UV) radiation shines on metal the photons are absorbed by the Electron in the metal. The Electron are then excited up to higher Energy level When an Electron returns to lower Energy level another photon is emitted. This is how Light is Reflection (physics) off metal surface. In previous chapters you have studied Geometrical optics which tells us what happens to Ray (optics) of Light when they are Reflection (physics) off surface or Refraction through lens. That tells us what happens to Light Ray (optics) made up of many photons on large scale. If you look at smaller level i.e. on Optical microscope scale then Reflection (physics) and Refraction happen by all the photons interacting with the atoms of the lens or mirror. The photons get absorbed and re-emitted many times before emerging as the finals Ray (optics) of Light that we see. Scattering of Light is responsible for many effects in everyday life. We see that certain materials are red or blue for example since they contain materials that have Energy level differences that correspond to the Energy of the photons that make up red or blue Light These materials then Reflection (physics) the red or blue Light and absorb the other Wavelength in the visible spectrum. White objects Reflection (physics) photons of all Wavelength in the visual spectrum while black objects absorb these photons. Because truly black object absorbs all the visual Wavelength of Light and does not re-emit photons at visual Wavelength we can say that black is not Color itself but rather lack of Color Also since black objects absorb visual Light they heat up more than objects of other Color which Reflection (physics) Light at certain Wavelength Metals generally Reflection (physics) most Wavelength of visible Light but they will Reflection (physics) the Light in certain Direction (geometry) given by Specular reflection in Geometrical optics This is different to most materials like wood or fabric which Reflection (physics) Light in all Direction (geometry) Metals have this property since they have Electron that are not bound to atoms and can move freely through the metal. This is unlike most other materials that have their Electron bound closely to the atoms. These free Electron in metals can then absorb and Reflection (physics) photons of wide range of Energy Ultraviolet Light (which has shorter Wavelength than visible Light will pass through some substances such as many Plasticity (physics) because they do not have the right Energy level to absorb it and re-emit it. X-rays (also short Wavelength will also pass through most materials since the Energy of X-rays correspond to the Energy level of atomic nuclei. Such nuclei are much smaller than atoms so it is much less likely for an X-ray to hit nucleus instead of the whole atom. Most materials will absorb infrared radiation (longer Wavelength than visible Light since the Energy of that radiation often correspond to rotational or vibrational Energy level of molecules. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.2.3|Why is the sky blue?|637
The sun emits Light in many different Wavelength including all of the visible Wavelength Light which is made up of all the visible Wavelength appears white. So what causes the sky to look blue? The air is not just full of nitrogen and oxygen gases. It is also full of tiny dust grains. The Light from the sun Scattering off these many dust grains. The chance that the Light will Scattering off one of these dust grains is bigger for shorter Wavelength The short Wavelength blue Light is therefore Scattering much more than the other Color At noon when the Light from the sun is coming straight down (see the picture below) the Scattering blue Light reaches your eyes from all Direction (geometry) and so the sky appears blue. The other Wavelength do not get Scattering much and therefore miss your line of sight. At sunrise or sunset the Direction (geometry) of the Light coming from the sun is now straight towards your eyes (see picture below). Therefore the Scattering blue Light cant be seen because it is Scattering out of your line of sight. The redder Color (oranges and reds) can now be seen because they are not Scattering as much and still fall in your line of sight. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.3|The photoelectric effect|638
Around the turn of the twentieth century it was observed by number of physicists (including Hertz Thomson and Von Lenard) that when Light was shone on metal Electron were emitted by the metal. This is called the Photoelectric effect (photo- for Light electric- for the Electron Definition: The Photoelectric effect The Photoelectric effect is the process whereby an Electron is emitted by metal when Light shines on it. At that time Light was thought to be purely Wave Therefore physicists thought that if more intense (i.e. brighter) Light was shone on metal then the Electron would be knocked out with greater kinetic Energy than if faint Light was shone on them. However Von Lenard observed that this did not happen at all. The intensity of the Light made no difference to the kinetic Energy of the emitted Electron Also it was observed that the Electron were emitted immediately when Light was shone on the metal there was no time delay. Einstein solved this problem by proposing that Light is made up of packets of Energy called quanta (now called photons) which interacted with the Electron in the metal like particles instead of Wave Each incident photon would transfer all its Energy to one Electron in the metal. For specific Color of Light (i.e. certain Wavelength or Frequency the Energy of the photons is given by hf hc where is Plancks constant. The Energy needed to knock an Electron out of the metal is called the Work (physics) function (symbol of the metal. Therefore the amount of Energy left over as the kinetic Energy (Ek) of the emitted Electron would be the difference between the incoming photons Energy and the Energy needed to knock out the Electron Work (physics) function of the metal): Ek hf Increasing the intensity of the Light (i.e. making it brighter) did not change the Wavelength of the Light and therefore the Electron would be emitted with the same kinetic Energy as before This solved the paradox and showed that Light has both Wave nature and particle nature. Einstein won the Nobel prize for this quantum theory and his explanation of the Photoelectric effect Increasing the intensity of the Light actually means increasing the number of incident photons. Therefore since each photon only gives Energy to one Electron more incident photons meansmore Electron would be knocked out of the metal but their kinetic Energy would be the same as before. The Photoelectric effect was first observed in the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in 1887. In 1899 J.J. Thomson proved that it was Electron that were emitted. The Photoelectric effect was theoretically explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. The discovery and understanding of the Photoelectric effect was one of the major breakthroughs in science in the twentieth century as it provided concrete evidence of the particle nature of Light It overturned previously held views that Light was composed purely of continuous transverse Wave On the one hand the Wave nature is good description of phenomena such as Diffraction and interference for Light and on the other hand the Photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of Light This is now known as the dual-nature of Light (dual means two) While solving problems we need to decide for ourselves whether we should consider the Wave property or the particle property of Light For example when dealing with interference and Diffraction Light should be treated as Wave whereas when dealing with Photoelectric effect we consider the particle nature. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.3.1|Applications of the photoelectric effect|640
We have learnt that metal contains Electron that are free to move between the valence and conduction bands. When photon strikes the surface of metal it gives all its Energy to one Electron in the metal. If the photon Energy is equal to the Energy between two Energy level then the Electron is excited to the higher Energy level If the photon Energy is greater than or equal to the Work (physics) function Energy needed to escape from the metal) then the Electron is emitted from the surface of the metal (the Photoelectric effect The Work (physics) function is different for different elements. The smaller the Work (physics) function the easier it is for Electron to be emitted from the metal. Metals with low Work (physics) functions make good Electrical conductor This is because the Electron are attached less strongly to their surroundings and can move more easily through these materials. This reduces the Electrical Electrical resistance and conductance and conductance of the material to the flow of Electric current i.e. it conducts well. Table 31.1 shows the Work (physics) functions for range of elements. The Electron volt is the kinetic Energy gained by an Electron passing through Voltage of one volt (1 V). volt is not measure of Energy but the Electron volt is unit of Energy When you connect 1.5 Volt battery to circuit you can give 1.5 eV of Energy to every Electron 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.3.2|Real-life applications|642
Solar Cells The Photoelectric effect may seem like very easy way to produce electricity from the sun. This is why people choose to make solar panels out of materials like silicon to generate electricity. In real-life however the amount of electricity generated is less than expected. This is because not every photon knocks out an Electron Other processes such as Reflection (physics) or Scattering also happen. This means that only fraction 10 (depends on the material) of the photons produce photoelectrons. This drop in efficiency results in lower measured Electric current Much Work (physics) is being done in industry to improve this efficiency so that the panels can generate as high Electric current as possible and create as much electricity as possible form the sun. But even these smaller electrical Electric current are useful in applications like solar-powered calculators. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.4|Emission and absorption spectra|643

---------------------------------------------------------

31.4.1|Emission Spectra|643
You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom. The Electron surrounding the atomic nucleus are arranged in series of levels of increasing Energy Each element has its own distinct set of Energy level This arrangement of Energy level serves as the atoms unique fingerprint. In the early 1900s scientists found that liquid or solid heated to high Temperature would give off broad range of Color of Light However gas heated to similar Temperature would emit Light only at certain specific Color Wavelength The reason for this observation was not understood at the time. Scientists studied this effect using discharge tube. Figure 31.3: Diagram of discharge tube. The tube is filled with gas. When high enough Voltage is applied to both ends of the tube the gas ionises and acts like Electrical conductor allowing Electric current to flow through the circuit. The Electric current excites the atoms of the ionised gas. When the atoms fall back to their ground state they emit photons to carry off the excess Energy discharge tube (Figure 31.3) is glass gas-filled tube with metal plate at both ends. If large enough Voltage is applied between the two metal plates the gas atoms inside the tube will absorb enough Energy to make some of their Electron come off i.e. the gas atoms are ionised. These Electron start moving through the gas and create Electric current which raises some Electron in other atoms to higher Energy level Then as the Electron in the atoms fall back down they emit Electromagnetic radiation The amount of Light emitted at different Wavelength called the Emission spectrum spectrum is shown for discharge tube filled with hydrogen gas in figure 31.4 below. Only certain Wavelength (i.e. Color of Light are seen as shown by the thick black lines in the picture. Figure 31.4: Diagram of the Emission spectrum spectrum of hydrogen in the visible spectrum. Four lines are visible and are labeled with their Wavelength The three lines in the 400500 nm range are in the blue part of the spectrum while the higher line (656 nm) is in the redorange part. Eventually scientists realized that these lines come from photons of specific Energy emitted by Electron making transitions between specific Energy level of the atom. Figure ?? shows an example of this happening. When an Electron in an atom falls from higher Energy level to lower Energy level it emits photon to carry off the extra Energy This photons Energy is equal to the Energy difference between the two Energy level As we previously discussed the Frequency of photon is related to its Energy through the equation hf. Since specific photon Frequency (or Wavelength gives us specific Color we can see how each Color line is associated with specific transition. Figure 31.5: In this diagram are shown some of the Electron Energy level for the hydrogen atom. The arrows show the Electron transitions from higher Energy level to lower Energy level The Energy of the emitted photons are the same as the Energy difference between two Energy level You can think of absorption as the opposite process. The arrows would point upwards and the Electron would jump up to higher levels when they absorp photon of the right Energy Visible Light is not the only kind of Electromagnetic radiation emitted. More energetic or less energetic transitions can produce ultraviolet or infrared radiation. However because each atom has its own distinct set of Energy level (its fingerprint) each atom has its own distinct Emission spectrum spectrum. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.4.2|Absorption spectra|644
As you know atoms do not only emit photons they also absorb photons. If photon hits an atom and the Energy of the photon is the same as the gap between two Electron Energy level in the atom then the Electron can absorb the photon and jump up to the higher Energy level If the atom has no Energy level differences that equal the incoming photons Energy it cannot absorb the photon and can only Scattering it. Using this effect if we have source of photons of various Energy we can obtain the Absorption spectroscopy for different materials. To get an Absorption spectroscopy just shine white Light on sample of the material that you are interested in. White Light is made up of all the different Wavelength of visible Light put together. In the Absorption spectroscopy the Energy level corresponding to the absorbed photons show up as black lines because the photons of these Wavelength have been absorbed and dont show up. Because of this the Absorption spectroscopy is the exact inverse of the Emission spectrum spectrum. Look at the two figures below. In figure 31.6 you can see the Emission spectrum lines of hyrodrogen. Figure 31.7 shows the Absorption spectroscopy It is the exact opposite of the Emission spectrum spectrum Both Emission spectrum and absorption techniques can be used to get the same information about the Energy level of an atom. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.4.3|Colours and energies of electromagnetic radiation|646
We saw in the explanation of why the sky is blue that different Wavelength or Frequency of Light correspond to different Color of Light The table below gives the Wavelength and Color for Light in the visible spectrum: We also know that the Energy of photon of Light can be found from: hf hc Therefore if we know the Frequency or Wavelength of Light we can calculate the photons Energy and vice versa. 
---------------------------------------------------------

31.4.4|Applications of emission and absorption spectra|648
The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is called spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is tool widely used in astronomy to learn different things about astronomical objects. Identifying elements in astronomical objects using their spectra Measuring the spectrum of Light from star can tell astronomers what the star is made of Since each element emits or absorbs Light only at particular Wavelength astronomers can identify what elements are in the stars from the lines in their spectra. From studying the spectra of many stars we know that there are many different types of stars which contain different elements and in different amounts. Determining Velocity of galaxies using spectroscopy You have already learned in Chapter 24 about the Doppler effect and how the Frequency (and Wavelength of Sound Wave changes depending on whether the object emitting the Sound is moving towards or away from you. The same thing happens to Electromagnetic radiation If the object emitting the Light is moving towards us then the Wavelength of the Light appears shorter (called blue-shifted). If the object is moving away from us then the Wavelength of its Light appears stretched out (called red-shifted). The Doppler effect affects the spectra of objects in space depending on their Motion relative to us on the earth. For example the Light from distant galaxy which is moving away from us at some Velocity will appear red-shifted. This means that the Emission spectrum and absorption lines in the galaxys spectrum will be shifted to longer Wavelength (lower Frequency Knowing where each line in the spectrum would normally be if the galaxy was not moving and comparing to their red-shifted Position (vector) allows astronomers to precisely measure the Velocity of the galaxy relative to the earth Global warming and greenhouse gases The sun emits radiation Light over range of Wavelength which are mainly in the visible part of the spectrum. Radiation at these Wavelength passes through the gases of the atmosphere to warm the land and the oceans below. The warm earth then radiates this heat at longer infrared Wavelength Carbon-dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere has Energy level which correspond to the infrared Wavelength which allow it to absorb the infrared radiation. It then also emits at infrared Wavelength in all Direction (geometry) This effect stops large amount of the infrared radiation getting out of the atmosphere which causes the atmosphere and the earth to heat up. More radiation is coming in than is getting back out. Therefore increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases the amount of trapped infrared radiation and therefore the overall Temperature of the earth. The earth is very sensitive and complicated system upon which life depends and changing the delicate balances of Temperature and atmospheric gas content may have disastrous consequences if we are not careful.

31.5|Lasers|650
Laser is device that produces special type of Light all the Laser photons are identical They all have the same Wavelength (and Frequency Amplitude and phase. Since they all have the same Wavelength this means they all have the same Color and the Light is called monochromatic. (Note: mono means one or single and chromatic means Color This is very different to most other Light sources which produce Light with range of Wavelength (e.g. white Light from the sun consists of all the visible Wavelength Laser Light is highly Direction (geometry) and can be focused very well. This focus allows Laser beams to be used over long Distance and to pack lot of Energy into the beam while still requiring reasonably small amounts of Energy to be generated. Each centimetre of typical Laser beam contains many billions of photons. These special properties of Laser Light come from the way in which the Laser photons are created and the Energy level of the material that makes up the Laser These properties make Laser Light extremely useful in many applications from CD players to eye surgery. The term Laser stands for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission spectrum of Radiation. This stimulated Emission spectrum is different to the spontaneous Emission spectrum already discussed earlier. Lets review the absorption and Emission spectrum processes which can occur in atoms. Absorption: As you can see in the picture above absorption happens when an Electron jumps up to higher Energy level by absorbing photon which has an Energy equal to the Energy difference between the two Energy level Spontaneous Emission spectrum Spontaneous Emission spectrum is when an Electron in higher Energy level drops down to lower Energy level and photon is emitted with an Energy equal to the Energy difference between the two levels. There is no interference in this process from outside factors. Usually spontaneous Emission spectrum happens very quickly after an Electron gets into an excited state. In other words the lifetime of the excited state is very short. However there are some excited states where an Electron can remain in the higher Energy level for longer time than usual before dropping down to lower level. These excited states are called metastable states. Stimulated Emission spectrum As the picture above shows stimulated Emission spectrum happens when photon with an Energy equal to the Energy difference between two levels interacts with an Electron in the higher level. This stimulates the Electron to emit an identical photon and drop down to the lower Energy level This process results in two photons at the end. Definition: Spontaneous Emission spectrum Spontaneous Emission spectrum occurs when an atom is in an unstable excited state and randomly decays to less energetic state emitting photon to carry off the excess Energy The unstable state decays in characteristic time called the lifetime. Definition: Meta-stable state meta-stable state is an excited atomic state that has an unusually long lifetime compared to the lifetimes of other excited states of that atom. While most excited states have lifetimes measured in microseconds and nanoseconds (106 and 109 s) meta-stable states can have lifetimes of milliseconds (103 s) or even seconds. Definition: Stimulated Emission spectrum Stimulated Emission spectrum occurs when photon interacts with an excited atom causing the atom to decay and emit another identical photon.

31.5.1|How a laser works|652
The important process involved in how Laser Work (physics) is stimulated Emission spectrum as you can tell from what Laser stands for You can imagine that stimulated Emission spectrum can lead to more and more identical photons being released in the following way: Imagine we have an Electron in an excited metastable state and it drops down to the ground state by emitting photon. If this photon then travels through the material and meets another Electron in the metastable excited state this will cause the Electron to drop down to the lower Energy level and another photon to be emitted. Now there are two photons of the same Energy If these photons then both move through the material and each interacts with another Electron in metastable state this will result in them each causing an additional photon to be released. i.e. from photons we then get and so on This is how Laser Light is produced. Figure 31.8: Spontaneous Emission spectrum is two step process as shown here. First Energy from an external source is applied to an atom in the Laser medium raising its Energy to an excited (metastable) state. After some time it will decay back down to its ground state and emit the excess Energy in the form of photon. This is the first stage in the formation of Laser beam. Figure 31.9: Stimulated Emission spectrum is also two step process as shown here. First Laser photon encounters an atom that has been raised to an excited state just like in the case of spontaneous Emission spectrum The photon then causes the atom to decay to its ground state and emit another photon identical to the incoming photon. This is the second step in the creation of Laser beam. It happens many many times as the Laser photons pass through the Geometrical optics cavity until the Laser beam builds up to full Strength of materials This can only happen if there are many Electron in metastable state. If most of the Electron are in the ground state then they will just absorb the photons and no extra photons will be emitted. However if more Electron are in the excited metastable state than in the ground state then the process of stimulated Emission spectrum will be able to continue. Usually in atoms most of the Electron are in the lower Energy level and only few are in excited states. When most of the Electron are in the excited metastable state and only few are in the ground state this is called population inversion (the populations are swapped around) and this is when stimulated Emission spectrum can occur. To start off the process the Electron first have to be excited up into the metastable state. This is done using an external Energy source. Definition: Population inversion Population inversion is when more atoms are in an excited state than in their ground state. It is necessary condition to sustain Laser beam so that there are enough excited atoms that can be stimulated to emit more photons. Therefore materials used to make Laser Light must must have metastable states which can allow population inversion to occur when an external Energy source is applied. Some substances which are used to make Laser are listed in table 31.3. You can see that gases (such as Helium-Neon mixture) liquids (such as dyes) and solids (such as the precious stone ruby) are all used to make Laser Material Type Wavelength Uses HeliumNeon gas 6328 nm scientific research holography Argon ion gas 4880 nm medicine Carbon dioxide gas 106 industry (cutting welding) surgery HeliumCadmium vapor 325 nm printing scientific research Ruby solidstate 6943 nm holography Neodymium YAG solidstate 1064 industry surgery research (Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) TitaniumSapphire solidstate 6501100 nm research Laser diode semiconductor 3751080 nm telecommunications industry printing CD players Laser pointers Table 31.3: selection of different Laser The Laser material and general type of each Laser is given along with typical Wavelength of the Laser Light they create. Examples of the real-world applications it is used for are also given. All these materials allow population inversion to be set up. The first Work (physics) Laser using synthetic ruby as the Laser material was made by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu California. Later in the same year the Iranian physicist Ali Javan together with William Bennet and Donald Herriot made the first gas Laser using helium and neon. Javan received the Albert Einstein Award in 1993.

31.5.2|A simple laser|654
Laser consists of number of different parts that Work (physics) together to create the Laser beam. Figure 31.10 shows the different parts of the Laser while Figure 31.11 shows how they create the Laser beam. The basis of the Laser is the Laser material. The Laser material consists of the atoms that are used to create the Laser beam. Many different materials can be used as Laser material and their Energy level determine the characteristics of the Laser Some examples of different Laser are shown in Table 31.3. The Laser material is contained in the Geometrical optics cavity. Before the Laser is turned on all the atoms in the Laser material are in their ground state. The first step in creating Laser beam is to add Energy to the Laser material to raise most of the Electron into an excited metastable state. This is called pumping the Laser The creation of the Laser beam starts through the process of spontaneous Emission spectrum shown in Figure 31.8. An Electron drops down to the ground state and emits photon with Energy equal to the Energy difference of the two Energy level This Laser photon is the beginning of the Laser Figure 31.11: Diagram of Laser showing the process of creating Laser beam. (1) source of external Energy is applied to the Laser medium raising the atoms to an excited state. (2) An excited atom decays though spontaneous Emission spectrum emitting photon. (3) The photon encounters another excited atom and causes it to decay through stimulated Emission spectrum creating another photon. (4) The photons bounce back and forth through the Laser medium between the mirrors building up more and more photons. (5) small percentage of the photons pass through the partially-silvered mirror to become the Laser beam we see. beam. Sometimes Laser photon runs into another excited Electron Then stimulated Emission spectrum occurs and the Electron drops down to the ground state and emits an additional identical photon as shown in Figure 31.9. Since the Laser material typically has large number of atoms one Laser photon passing through this material will rapidly cause large number of photons just like it to be emitted. The Geometrical optics cavity keeps the Laser photons inside the Laser cavity so they can build up the Laser beam. At each end is Curved mirror one is full mirror and one is partial mirror. The full mirror is totally Reflection (physics) The partial mirror transmits small amount of the Light that hits it(less than 1). The mirrors are carefully aligned so that photons that Reflection (physics) off one mirror become trapped and bounce back and forth between the mirrors many times causing more and more stimulated Emission spectrum The photons that eventually escape through the partially-silvered mirror become the Laser beam that we see. As the photons bounce between mirrors they continually pass through the Laser material stimulating those atoms to emit more photons. This creates an ever increasing beam of photons all with the same characteristics all traveling in the same Direction (geometry) In this way the Geometrical optics cavity helps to amplify the original Laser photons into concentrated intense beam of photons. The Laser cavity also helps to narrow the Frequency range of Laser Light emitted. The Distance between the two mirrors defines the cavity mode which only allows Light of narrow range of Frequency to continue being Reflection (physics) back and forth. Light of other Frequency damped out. (This is just like in the chapter on the Physics of music where pipe of certain Length corresponds to particular Wavelength of Sound Therefore only narrow Frequency of Light can be emitted. In 1953 Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser device operating on similar principles to the Laser but producing microwave rather than Geometrical optics radiation. Towness maser was incapable of making continuous beam. Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the former Soviet Union Work (physics) independently and developed method of making continuous beam using more than two Energy level Townes Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.
