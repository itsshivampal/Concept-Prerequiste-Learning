8.1 Introduction

Magnetism is the force that a magnetic object exerts, through its magnetic field, on another

object. The two objects do not have to physically touch each other for the force to be exerted.

Object 2 feels the magnetic force from Object 1 because of Object 1's surrounding magnetic

field.

Humans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years. For example, lodestone is

a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite. It has the property of attracting iron

objects. It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records; from around 800 BCE in

Europe and around 2 600 BCE in Asia.

Itneterreessttinigng The root of the English word magnet is from the Greek word magnes, probably

FFacctt from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone.
