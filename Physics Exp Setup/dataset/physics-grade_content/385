23.6 End of Chapter Exercises

1. The force vs. displacement graph shows the amount of force applied to an object by

three different people. Abdul applies force to the object for the first 4 m of its

displacement, Beth applies force from the 4 m point to the 6 m point, and Charles

applies force from the 6 m point to the 8 m point. Calculate the work done by each

person on the object? Which of the three does the most work on the object?

Doppler Effect - Grade 12

24.1 Introduction

Have you noticed how the pitch of a car hooter changes as the car passes by or how the pitch

of a radio box on the pavement changes as you drive by? This effect is known as the Doppler

Effect and will be studied in this chapter.

Itneterreessttinigng The Doppler Effect is named after Johann Christian Andreas Doppler (29

FFacctt November 1803 - 17 March 1853), an Austrian mathematician and physicist

who first explained the phenomenon in 1842.

24.2 The Doppler Effect with Sound and Ultrasound

As seen in the introduction, there are two situations which lead to the Doppler Effect:

1. When the source moves relative to the observer, for example the pitch of a car hooter as

it passes by.

2. When the observer moves relative to the source, for example the pitch of a radio on the

pavement as you drive by.

Definition: Doppler Effect

The Doppler effect is the apparent change in frequency and wavelength of a wave when the

observer and the source of the wave move relative to each other.

We experience the Doppler effect quite often in our lives, without realising that it is science

taking place. The changing sound of a taxi hooter or ambulance as it drives past are examples

of this as you have seen in the introduction.

The question is how does the Doppler effect take place. Let us consider a source of sound

waves with a constant frequency and amplitude. The sound waves can be drawn as concentric

circles where each circle represents another wavefront, like in figure 24.1 below.

The sound source is the dot in the middle and is stationary. For the Doppler effect to take

place, the source must be moving. Let's consider the following situation: The source (dot)

emits one peak (represented by a circle) that moves away from the source at the same rate in

all directions.
