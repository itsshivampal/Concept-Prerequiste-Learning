7.1 Introduction

You are indoors on a sunny day. A beam of sunlight through a window lights up a section of

the floor. How would you draw this sunbeam? You might draw a series of parallel lines showing

the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate - no matter

how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam! However, this is a

good way to draw light. It is also a good way to model light geometrically, as we will see in this

chapter.

We will call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays. Since light is an electromagnetic

wave, you could think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave. Or, you could

think of a light ray as the path taken by a miniscule particle that carries light. We will always

draw them the same way: as straight lines between objects, images, and optical devices.

We can use light rays to model mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms. The study

of how light interacts with materials is optics. When dealing with light rays, we are usually

interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it. From these angles,

we can work out, for example, the distance between an object and its reflection. We therefore

refer to this kind of optics as geometrical optics.
