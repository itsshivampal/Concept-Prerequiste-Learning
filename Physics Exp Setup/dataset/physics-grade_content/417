26.6.1 Subsonic Flight

Definition: Subsonic

Subsonic refers to speeds slower than the speed of sound.

When a source emits sound waves and is moving but slower than the speed of sound you get

the situation in this picture. Notice that the source moving means that the wavefronts and

therefore peaks in the wave are actually closer together in the one direction and further apart

in the other.

If you measure the waves on the side where the peaks are closer together you'll measure a

different wavelength than on the other side of the source. This means that the noise from the

source will sound different on the different sides. This is called the Doppler Effect.

Definition: Doppler Effect

when the wavelength and frequency measured by an observer are different to those emitted

by the source due to movement of the source or observer.
