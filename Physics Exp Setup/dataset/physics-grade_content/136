9.7 Attraction between charged and uncharged objects

9.7.1 Polarisation of Insulators

Unlike conductors, the electrons in insulators (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the

insulator and cannot move around freely in the material. However, a charged object can still

exert a force on a neutral insulator through the concept of polarisation.

If a positively charged rod is brought close to a neutral insulator such as polystyrene, it can

attract the bound electrons to move round to the side of the atoms which is closest to the rod

and cause the positive nuclei to move slightly to the opposite side of the atoms. This process is

called polarisation. Although it is a very small (microscopic) effect, if there are many atoms and

the polarised object is light (e.g. a small polystyrene ball), it can add up to enough force to be

attracted onto the charged rod. Remember, that the polystyrene is only polarised, not charged.

The polystyrene ball is still neutral since no charge was added or removed from it. The picture

shows a not-to-scale view of the polarised atoms in the polystyrene ball:

Some materials are made up of molecules which are already polarised. These are molecules which

have a more positive and a more negative side but are still neutral overall. Just as a polarised

polystyrene ball can be attracted to a charged rod, these materials are also affected if brought

close to a charged object.

9.8 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROSTATICS - GRADE 10

Water is an example of a substance which is made of polarised molecules. If a positively charged

rod is brought close to a stream of water, the molecules can rotate so that the negative sides all

line up towards the rod. The stream of water will then be attracted to the rod since opposite

charges attract.

9.8 Summary

1. Objects can be positively charged, negatively charged or neutral.

2. Objects that are neutral have equal numbers of positive and negative charge.

3. Unlike charges are attracted to each other and like charges are repelled from each other.

4. Charge is neither created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred.

5. Charge is measured in coulombs (C).

6. Conductors allow charge to move through them easily.

7. Insulators do not allow charge to move through them easily.

9.9 End of chapter exercise

opposite charges is ?????.

4. I have two positively charged metal balls placed 2 m apart.

4.1 Is the electrostatic force between the balls attractive or repulsive?

4.2 If I now move the balls so that they are 1 m apart, what happens to the strength of

the electrostatic force between them?

5. I have 2 charged spheres each hanging from string as shown in the picture below.

Choose the correct answer from the options below: The spheres will

5.1 swing towards each other due to the attractive electrostatic force between them.

5.2 swing away from each other due to the attractive electrostatic force between them.

5.3 swing towards each other due to the repulsive electrostatic force between them.

5.4 swing away from each other due to the repulsive electrostatic force between them.
