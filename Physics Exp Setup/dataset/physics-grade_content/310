18.5 Motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field it experiences a force. For a particle

that is moving at right angles to the magnetic field, the force is given by:

F = qvB

where q is the charge on the particle, v is the velocity of the particle and B is the magnetic

field through which the particle is moving.

Worked Example 123: Charged particle moving in a magnetic field

Question: An electron travels at 150m.s−1 at right angles to a magnetic field of

80 000 T. What force is exerted on the electron?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to determine the force on a moving charge in a magnetic field

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We can use the formula:

F = qvB

Step 3 : Determine what is given

We are given

• q = 1,6× 10−19C (The charge on an electron)

• v = 150m.s−1

• B = 80 000T

Step 4 : Determine the force

F = qvB

= (1,6× 10−19C)(150m.s−1)(80 000T)

= 1,92× 10−12N

Important: The direction of the force exerted on a charged particle moving through a

magnetic field is determined by using the Right Hand Rule.

Point your fingers in the direction of the velocity of the charge and turn them (as if turning

a screwdriver) towards the direction of the magnetic field. Your thumb will point in the

direction of the force. If the charge is negative, the direction of the force will be opposite

to the direction of your thumb.

Similarly, a transformer designed to output less than it takes in across the input coil is called a

step-down transformer. A step-down transformer has more windings on the primary coil than

on the primary coil. This means that:

Np > Ns

We use a step-up transformer to increase the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary

coil. It is used at power stations to increase the voltage for the transmission lines. A step-down

transformer decreases the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is particularly

used to decrease the voltage from the transmission lines to a voltage which can be used in

factories and in homes.

Transformer technology has made long-range electric power distribution practical. Without the

ability to efficiently step voltage up and down, it would be cost-prohibitive to construct power

systems for anything but close-range (within a few kilometres) use.

As useful as transformers are, they only work with AC, not DC. This is because the

phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on changing magnetic fields, and direct current (DC)

can only produce steady magnetic fields, transformers simply will not work with direct current.

Of course, direct current may be interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of a

transformer to create a changing magnetic field (as is done in automotive ignition systems to

produce high-voltage spark plug power from a low-voltage DC battery), but pulsed DC is not

that different from AC. Perhaps more than any other reason, this is why AC finds such

widespread application in power systems.

18.4.1 Real-world applications

Transformers are very important in the supply of electricity nationally. In order to reduce energy

losses due to heating, electrical energy is transported from power stations along power lines at

high voltage and low current. Transformers are used to step the voltage up from the power

station to the power lines, and step it down from the power lines to buildings where it is needed.

Exercise: Transformers

1. Draw a sketch of the main features of a transformer

2. Use Faraday's Law to explain how a transformer works in words and pictures.

3. Use the equation for Faraday's Law to derive an expression involving the ratio

between the voltages and number of windings in the primary and secondary

coils.

4. If we have Np = 100 and Ns = 50 and we connect the primary winding to a

230 V, 50Hz supply then calculate the voltage on the secondary winding.

5. State the difference between a step-up and a step-down transformer in both

structure and function.

6. Give an example of the use of transformers.
