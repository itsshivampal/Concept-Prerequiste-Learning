24.3 The Doppler Effect with Light

Light is a wave and earlier you learnt how you can study the properties of one wave and apply

the same ideas to another wave. The same applies to sound and light. We know the Doppler

effect affects sound waves when the source is moving. Therefore, if we apply the Doppler effect

to light, the frequency of the emitted light should change when the source of the light is

moving relative to the observer.

When the frequency of a sound wave changes, the sound you hear changes. When the

frequency of light changes, the colour you would see changes.

This means that the Doppler effect can be observed by a change in sound (for sound waves)

and a change in colour (for light waves). Keep in mind that there are sounds that we cannot

hear (for example ultrasound) and light that we cannot see (for example ultraviolet light).

We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to light. When talking

about light we use slightly different names to describe what happens. If you look at the colour

spectrum (more details Chapter 30) then you will see that blue light has shorter wavelengths

than red light. If you are in the middle of the visible colours then longer wavelengths are more

red and shorter wavelengths are more blue. So we call shifts towards longer wavelengths

"red-shifts" and shifts towards shorter wavelengths "blue-shifts".

A shift in wavelength is the same as a shift in frequency. Longer wavelengths of light have

lower frequencies and shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies. From the Doppler effect we

know that when things move towards you any waves they emit that you measure are shifted to

shorter wavelengths (blueshifted). If things move away from you, the shift is to longer

wavelengths (redshifted).

24.2.1 Ultrasound and the Doppler Effect

Ultrasonic waves (ultrasound) are sound waves with a frequency greater than 20 000 Hz (the

upper limit of hearing). These waves can be used in medicine to determine the direction of

blood flow. The device, called a Doppler flow meter, sends out sound waves. The sound waves

can travle through skin and tissue and will be reflected by moving objects in the body (like

blood). The reflected waves return to the flow meter where its frequency (received frequency)

is compared to the transmitted frequency. Because of the Doppler effect, blood that is moving

towards the flow meter will change the sound to a higher frequency (blue shift) and blood that

is moving away from the flow meter will cause a lower frequency (red shift).

Ultrasound can be used to determine whether blood is flowing in the right direction in the

circulation system of unborn babies, or identify areas in the body where blood flow is restricted

due to narrow veins. The use of ultrasound equipment in medicine is called sonography or

ultrasonography.

Exercise: The Doppler Effect with Sound

1. Suppose a train is approaching you as you stand on the platform at the

station. As the train approaches the station, it slows down. All the while, the

engineer is sounding the hooter at a constant frequency of 400 Hz. Describe

the pitch and the changes in pitch that you hear.

2. Passengers on a train hear its whistle at a frequency of 740 Hz. Anja is

standing next to the train tracks. What frequency does Anja hear as the train

moves directly toward her at a speed of 25 m·s−1?

3. A small plane is taxiing directly away from you down a runway. The noise of

the engine, as the pilot hears it, has a frequency 1,15 times the frequency that

you hear. What is the speed of the plane?

4. A Doppler flow meter detected a blue shift in frequency while determining the

direction of blood flow. What does a "blue shift" mean and how does it take

place?
