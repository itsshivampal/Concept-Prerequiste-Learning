A full explanation of diode operation is complex. Here is a simplified description. The diode

consists of two semiconductor blocks attached together. Neither block is made of pure silicon

- they are both doped. Doping was described in more detail in Section 10.3.

In short, p-type semiconductor has fewer free electrons than normal semiconductor. ‘P' stands

for ‘positive', meaning a lack of electrons, although the material is actually neutral. The

locations where electrons are missing are called holes. This material can conduct electricity

well, because electrons can move into the holes, making a new hole somewhere else in the

material. Any extra electrons introduced into this region by the circuit will fill some or all of

the holes.

In n-type semiconductor, the situation is reversed. The material has an more free electrons

than normal semiconductor. ‘N' stands for ‘negative', meaning an excess of electrons, although

the material is actually neutral.

When a p-type semiconductor is attached to an n-type semiconductor, some of the free

electrons in the n-type move across to the p-type semiconductor. They fill the available holes

near the junction. This means that the region of the n-type semiconductor nearest the junction

has no free electrons (they've moved across to fill the holes). This makes this n-type

semiconductor positively charged. It used to be electrically neutral, but has since lost electrons.

The region of p-type semiconductor nearest the junction now has no holes (they've been filled

in by the migrating electrons). This makes the p-type semiconductor negatively charged. It

used to be electrically neutral, but has since gained electrons.

Without free electrons or holes, the central region can not conduct electricity well. It has a

high resistance, and is called the depletion band. This is shown in Figure 29.10.

You can explain the high resistance in a different way. A free electron in the n-type

semiconductor will be repelled from the p-type semiconductor because of its negative charge.

The electron will not go into the depletion band, and certainly won't cross the band to the

p-type semiconductor. You may ask, "But won't a free electron in the p-type semiconductor be

attracted across the band, carrying a current?" But there are no free electrons in p-type

semiconductor, so no current of this kind can flow.

If the diode is reverse-biased, the + terminal of the battery is connected to the n-type

semiconductor. This makes it even more negatively charged. It also removes even more of the

free electrons near the depletion band. At the same time, the − terminal of the battery is

connected to the p-type silicon. This will supply free electrons and fill in more of the holes next

to the depletion band. Both processes cause the depletion band to get wider. The resistance of

the diode (which was already high) increases. This is why a reverse-biased diode does not

conduct.

Another explanation for the increased resistance is that the battery has made the p-type

semiconductor more negative than it used to be, making it repel any electrons from the n-type

semiconductor which attempt to cross the depletion band.

On the other hand, if the diode is forward biased, the depletion band is made narrower. The

negative charge on the p-type silicon is cancelled out by the battery. The greater the voltage

used, the narrower the depletion band becomes. Eventually, when the voltage is about 0,6 V

(for silicon) the depletion band disappears. Once this has occurred, the diode conducts very

well.
