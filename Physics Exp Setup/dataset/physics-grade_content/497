Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science degree (with honours) in Mechanical

Engineering from the University of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design

project he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass re-enforced

plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging, Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a

subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He

currently lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology Engineering as a

mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and integrity of equipment installed during projects.

Pressure and Forces

In the mining industry, the roof (hangingwall) tends to drop as the face of the tunnel (stope) is

excavated for rock containing gold.

As one can imagine, a roof falling on one's head is not a nice prospect! Therefore the roof

needs to be supported.

Roof Face

The roof is not one big uniform chunk of rock. Rather it is broken up into smaller chunks. It is

assumed that the biggest chunk of rock in the roof has a mass of less than 20 000 kgs therefore

each support has to be designed to resist a force related to that mass. The strength of the

material (either wood or steel) making up the support is taken into account when working out

the minimum required size and thickness of the parts to withstand the force of the roof.
