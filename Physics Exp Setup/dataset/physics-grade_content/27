3.3.2 Differences between Distance and Displacement

Definition: Vectors and Scalars

A vector is a physical quantity with magnitude (size) and direction. A scalar is a physical

quantity with magnitude (size) only.

The differences between distance and displacement can be summarised as:

Distance Displacement

1. depends on the path 1. independent of path taken

2. always positive 2. can be positive or negative

3. is a scalar 3. is a vector

Exercise: Point of Reference

1. Use Figure 3.2.2 to answer the following questions.

(a) Jill walks to Joan's house and then to school, what is her distance and

displacement?

(b) John walks to Joan's house and then to school, what is his distance and

displacement?

(c) Jack walks to the shop and then to school, what is his distance and dis-

placement?

(d) What reference point did you use for each of the above questions?

2. You stand at the front door of your house (displacement, ∆x = 0 m). The

street is 10 m away from the front door. You walk to the street and back again.

(a) What is the distance you have walked?

(b) What is your final displacement?

(c) Is displacement a vector or a scalar? Give a reason for your answer.
