12.3.2 Newton's Second Law of Motion

According to Newton I, things 'like to keep on doing what they are doing'. In other words, if

an object is moving, it likes to keep on moving and if an object is stationary, it likes to stay

stationary. So how do objects start to move then?

Let us look at the example of a 10 kg box on a rough table. If we push lightly on the box as

indicated in the diagram, the box won't move. Let's say we applied a force of 100 N, yet the

box remains stationary. At this point a frictional force of 100 N is acting on the box, preventing

the box from moving. If we increase the force, lets say to 150 N and the box just about starts to

move, the frictional force is 150 N. To be able to move the box, we need to push hard enough to

overcome the friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply a force of 200 N remembering

that a frictional force of 150 N is present, the 'first' 150 N will be used to overcome or 'cancel'

the friction and the other 50 N will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate

an object we must have a resultant force acting on the block.

rough table

Now, what do you think will happen if we pushed harder, lets say 300 N? Or, what do you

think will happen if the mass of the block was more, say 20 kg, or what if it was less? Let us

investigate how the motion of an object is affected by mass and force.

12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11

1. A constant force of 20 N, acting at an angle of 30◦ to the horizontal, is applied

to a dynamics trolley.

2. Ticker tape attached to the trolley runs through a ticker timer of frequency 20

Hz as the trolley is moving on the frictionless surface.

3. The above procedure is repeated 4 times, each time using the same force, but

varying the mass of the trolley.

4. Shown below are sections of the four ticker tapes obtained. The tapes are

marked with the letters A, B, C, D, etc. A is the first dot, B is the second dot

and so on. The distance between each dot is also shown.

Instructions:

1. Use each tape to calculate the instantaneous velocity (in m·s−1) of the trolley

at points B and F. Use these velocities to calculate the trolley?s acceleration

in each case.

2. Use Newton's second law to calculate the mass of the trolley in each case.

3. Tabulate the mass and corresponding acceleration values as calculated in each

case. Ensure that each column and row in your table is appropriately labeled.

4. Draw a graph of acceleration vs. mass, using a scale of 1 cm = 1 m·s−2on the

y-axis and 1 cm = 1 kg on the x-axis.

5. Use your graph to read off the acceleration of the trolley if its mass is 5 kg.

6. Write down a conclusion for the experiment.

You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is, the slower it moved.

The acceleration is indirectly proportional to the mass. In mathematical terms: a ∝ 1

m

In a similar investigation where the mass is kept constant, but the applied force is varied, you

will find that the bigger the force is, the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the

trolley is therefore directly proportional to the resultant force. In mathematical terms: a ∝ F.

If we rearrange the above equations, we get a ∝ Fm OR F = ma

CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3
Newton formulated his second law as follows:
Definition: Newton's Second Law of Motion
If a resultant force acts on a body, it will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the
resultant force. The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant
force and indirectly proportional to the mass of the body. The mathematical representation
is a ∝ F .

Applying Newton's Second Law
Newton's Second Law can be applied to a variety of situations. We will look at the main types
of examples that you need to study.
Worked Example 64: Newton II - Box on a surface 1
Question: A 10 kg box is placed on a table. A horizontal force of 32 N is applied
to the box. A frictional force of 7 N is present between the surface and the box.
1. Draw a force diagram indicating all the horizontal forces acting on the box.
2. Calculate the acceleration of the box.

10 kg
Answer
Step 1 : Identify the horizontal forces and draw a force diagram
We only look at the forces acting in a horizontal direction (left-right) and not vertical
(up-down) forces. The applied force and the force of friction will be included. The
force of gravity, which is a vertical force, will not be included.

a = ? F1 = applied force on box (32 N)
F Ff = Frictional force (7 N)1

Step 2 : Calculate the acceleration of the box
We have been given:
Applied force F1 = 32 N
Frictional force Ff = - 7 N
Mass m = 10 kg
251
12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11
To calculate the acceleration of the box we will be using the equation FR = ma.
Therefore:
FR = ma
F1 + Ff = (10)(a)
32− 7 = 10 a
25 = 10 a
a = 2,5m · s−1towards the left
Worked Example 65: Newton II - box on surface 2
Question: Two crates, 10 kg and 15 kg respectively, are connected with a thick
rope according to the diagram. A force of 500 N is applied. The boxes move with
an acceleration of 2 m·s−2. One third of the total frictional force is acting on the
10 kg block and two thirds on the 15 kg block. Calculate:
1. the magnitude and direction of the frictional force present.
2. the magnitude of the tension in the rope at T.
a = 2 m·s−2
500 N
10 kg T 15 kg
Figure 12.3: Two crates on a surface
Answer
Step 3 : Draw a force diagram
Always draw a force diagram although the question might not ask for it. The
acceleration of the whole system is given, therefore a force diagram of the whole
system will be drawn. Because the two crates are seen as a unit, the force diagram
will look like this:
a = 2 m·s−2
Applied force = 500 N
Friction = ?
10 kg 15 kg
Figure 12.4: Force diagram for two crates on a surface
Step 4 : Calculate the frictional force
To find the frictional force we will apply Newton's Second Law. We are given the
mass (10 + 15 kg) and the acceleration (2 m·s−2). Choose the direction of motion
252
CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3
to be the positive direction (to the right is positive).
FR = ma
Fapplied + Ff = ma
500 + Ff = (10 + 15)(2)
Ff = 50− 500
Ff = −450N
The frictional force is 450 N opposite to the direction of motion (to the left).
Step 5 : Find the tension in the rope
To find the tension in the rope we need to look at one of the two crates on their
own. Let's choose the 10 kg crate. Firstly, we need to draw a force diagram:
a = 2 m·s−2
1
3 of total frictional force Tension T
Ff on 10 kg crate 10 kg
Figure 12.5: Force diagram of 10 kg crate
The frictional force on the 10 kg block is one third of the total, therefore:
Ff =
1
3× 450
Ff = 150 N
If we apply Newton's Second Law:
FR = ma
T + Ff = (10)(2)
T + (−150) = 20
T = 170 N
Note: If we had used the same principle and applied it to 15 kg crate, our calcula-
tions would have been the following:
FR = ma
Fapplied + T + Ff = (15)(2)
500 + T + (−300) = 30
T = −170 N
The negative answer here means that the force is in the direction opposite to the
motion, in other words to the left, which is correct. However, the question asks for
the magnitude of the force and your answer will be quoted as 170 N.
Worked Example 66: Newton II - Man pulling a box
Question: A man is pulling a 20 kg box with a rope that makes an angle of 60◦
with the horizontal. If he applies a force of 150 N and a frictional force of 15 N is
present, calculate the acceleration of the box.

Step 2 : Calculate the horizontal component of the applied force
The applied force is acting at an angle of 60 ◦ to the horizontal. We can only con-
sider forces that are parallel to the motion. The horizontal component of the applied
force needs to be calculated before we can continue:
Fx = 150 cos 60

Fx = 75N
Step 3 : Calculate the acceleration
To find the acceleration we apply Newton's Second Law:

Worked Example 67: Newton II - Truck and trailor
Question: A 2000 kg truck pulls a 500 kg trailer with a constant acceleration. The
engine of the truck produces a thrust of 10 000 N. Ignore the effect of friction.
1. Calculate the acceleration of the truck.
2. Calculate the tension in the tow bar T between the truck and the trailer, if the
tow bar makes an angle of 25◦ with the horizontal.

Figure 12.9: Force diagram for truck pulling a trailer
Step 2 : Find the acceleration of the system
In the absence of friction, the only force that causes the system to accelerate is the
thrust of the engine. If we now apply Newton's Second Law:
FR = ma
10000 = (500 + 2000)a
a = 4m · s−2 to the right
Step 3 : Find the horizontal component of T
We are asked to find the tension in the tow bar, but because the tow bar is acting
at an angle, we need to find the horizontal component first. We will find the
horizontal component in terms of T and then use it in the next step to find T.

T cos25◦
The horizontal component is T cos 25◦.
Step 4 : Find the tension in the tow bar
To find T, we will apply Newton's Second Law:
FR = ma
F − T cos 25◦ = ma
10000− T cos 25◦ = (2000)(4)
T cos 25◦ = 2000
T = 2206,76N
Object on an inclined plane
When we place an object on a slope the force of gravity (Fg) acts straight down and not
perpendicular to the slope. Due to gravity pulling straight down, the object will tend to slide
255
12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11
down the slope with a force equal to the horizontal component of the force of gravity (Fg sin θ).
The object will 'stick' to the slope due to the frictional force between the object and the surface.
As you increase the angle of the slope, the horizontal component will also increase until the
frictional force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope.
The force of gravity will also tend to push an object 'into' the slope. This force is equal to the
vertical component of the force of gravity (Fg cos θ). There is no movement in this direction as
this force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ?pushing force? is called
the normal force (N) and is equal to the resultant force in the vertical direction, Fg sin θ in this
case, but opposite in direction.
Important: Do not use the abbreviation W for weight as it is used to abbreviate 'work'.
Rather use the force of gravity Fg for weight.

256
CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the situation
The question asks us to identify the frictional force. The body is said to be at rest
on the plane, which means that it is not moving and therefore there is no resultant
force. The frictional force must therefore be balanced by the force F up the inclined
plane.
Step 2 : Choose the correct answer
The frictional force is equal to the horizontal component of the weight (Mg) which
is equal to Mg sin θ.
Worked Example 69: Newton II - Object on a slope
Question: A force T = 312 N is required to keep a body at rest on a frictionless
inclined plane which makes an angle of 35◦ with the horizontal. The forces acting
on the body are shown. Calculate the magnitudes of forces P and R, giving your
answers to three significant figures.
R T
35◦
35◦
P
Answer
Step 1 : Find the magnitude of P
We are usually asked to find the magnitude of T, but in this case T is given and we
are asked to find P. We can use the same equation. T is the force that balances the
horizontal component of P (Px) and therefore it has the same magnitude.
T = P sin θ
312 = P sin 35◦
P = 544 N
Step 2 : Find the magnitude of R
R can also be determined with the use of trigonometric ratios. The tan or cos ratio
can be used. We recommend that you use the tan ratio because it does not involve
using the value for P (for in case you made a mistake in calculating P).
R
tan 55◦ =

R
tan 55◦ =

R = tan 55◦ × 312
R = 445,6 N
R = 446 N
Note that the question asks that the answers be given to 3 significant figures. We
therefore round 445,6 N up to 446 N.

12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11
Lifts and rockets
So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across a surface, in other words hori-
zontal motion. Here we only considered horizontal forces, but we can also lift objects up or let
them fall. This is vertical motion where only vertical forces are being considered.
Let us consider a 500 kg lift, with no passengers, hanging on a cable. The purpose of the
cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go a little so that it
can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the motion
of the lift.
Stage 1:
The 500 kg lift is stationary at the second floor of a tall building.
Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant force acting on the lift. This
means that the upward forces must be balanced by the downward forces. The only force acting
down is the force of gravity which is equal to (500 x 9,8 = 4900 N) in this case. The cable must
therefore pull upwards with a force of 4900 N to keep the lift stationary at this point.
Stage 2:
The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of 1 m·s−2.
If the lift is accelerating, it means that there is a resultant force in the direction of the motion.
This means that the force acting upwards is now bigger than the force of gravity Fg (down). To
find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation:
(Remember to choose a direction as positive. We have chosen upwards as positive.)
FR = ma
Fc + Fg = ma
Fc + (−4900) = (500)(1)
Fc = 5400 N upwards
The answer makes sense as we need a bigger force upwards to cancel the effect of gravity as well
as make the lift go faster.
Stage 3:
The lift moves at a constant velocity.
When the lift moves at a constant velocity, it means that all the forces are balanced and that
there is no resultant force. The acceleration is zero, therefore FR = 0. The force acting upwards
is equal to the force acting downwards, therefore Fc = 4900 N.
Stage 4:
The lift slow down at a rate of 2m·s−2.
As the lift is now slowing down there is a resultant force downwards. This means that the force
acting downwards is bigger than the force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the force
applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as
positive, which means that the acceleration will be a negative number.
FR = ma
Fc + Fg = ma
Fc + (−4900) = (500)(−2)
Fc = 3900 N upwards
This makes sense as we need a smaller force upwards to ensure a resultant force down. The
force of gravity is now bigger than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down.
258
CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3
Stage 5:
The cable snaps.
When the cable snaps, the force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only
force that is present would be the force of gravity. The lift will freefall and its acceleration can
be calculated as follows:
FR = ma
Fc + Fg = ma
0 + (−4900) = (500)(a)
a = −9,8m · s−2
a = 9,8m · s−2downwards
Rockets
Like with lifts, rockets are also examples of objects in vertical motion. The force of gravity pulls
the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The force that the
engine exerts must overcome the force of gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The
worked example below looks at the application of Newton's Second Law in launching a rocket.
Worked Example 70: Newton II - rocket
Question: A rocket is launched vertically upwards into the sky at an acceleration
of 20 m·s−2. If the mass of the rocket is 5000 kg, calculate the magnitude and
direction of the thrust of the rocket?s engines.
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse what is given and what is asked
We have the following:
m = 5000 kg
a = 20 m·s−2
Fg = 5000 x 9,8 = 49000 N
We are asked to find the thrust of the rocket engine F1.
Step 2 : Find the thrust of the engine
We will apply Newton's Second Law:
FR = ma
F1 + Fg = ma
F1 + (−49000) = (5000)(20)
F1 = 149 000 N upwards

• Gas explodes inside the rocket.
• This exploding gas exerts a force on each side of the rocket (as shown in the
picture below of the explosion chamber inside the rocket).
Note that the forces shown in this picture are

forces in all directions.
• Due to the symmetry of the situation, all the forces exerted on the rocket are
balanced by forces on the opposite side, except for the force opposite the open

• This is therefore the resultant force acting on the rocket and it makes the rocket
accelerate forwards.

CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3

Step 2 : Find the mass, m.

Let us look at the lift with its passengers as a unit. The mass of this unit will be (250

+ m) kg and the force of the Earth pulling downwards (Fg) will be (250 + m) x 10.

If we apply Newton's Second Law to the situation we get:

Fnet = ma

FC − Fg = ma

7700− (250 +m)(10) = (250 +m)(1,6)

7700− 2500− 10 m = 400 + 1,6 m

4800 = 11,6 m

m = 413,79 kg
