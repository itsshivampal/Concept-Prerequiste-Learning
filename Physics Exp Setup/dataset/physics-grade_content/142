circuit.

10.1 CHAPTER 10. ELECTRIC CIRCUITS - GRADE 10

Activity :: Experiment : Closed circuits

Aim:

To determine what is required to make electrical charges flow. In this experiment,

we will use a lightbulb to check whether electrical charge is flowing in the circuit or

not. If charge is flowing, the lightbulb should glow. On the other hand, if no charge

is flowing, the lightbulb will not glow.

Apparatus:

You will need a small lightbulb which is attached to a metal conductor (e.g. a bulb

from a school electrical kit), some connecting leads and a battery.

Method:

Take the apparatus items and try to connect them in a way that you cause the light

bulb to glow (i.e. charge flows in the circuit).

Questions:

1. Once you have arranged your circuit elements to make the lightbulb glow, draw

your circuit.

2. What can you say about how the battery is connected? (i.e. does it have one

or two connecting leads attached? Where are they attached?)

3. What can you say about how the light bulb is connected in your circuit? (i.e.

does it connect to one or two connecting leads, and where are they attached?)

4. Are there any items in your circuit which are not attached to something? In

other words, are there any gaps in your circuit?

Write down your conclusion about what is needed to make an electric circuit work

and charge to flow.

In the experiment above, you will have seen that the light bulb only glows when there is a closed

circuit i.e. there are no gaps in the circuit and all the circuit elements are connected in a closed

loop. Therefore, in order for charges to flow, a closed circuit and an energy source (in this case

the battery) are needed. (Note: you do not have to have a lightbulb in the circuit! We used this

as a check that charge was flowing.)

Definition: Electric circuit

An electric circuit is a closed path (with no breaks or gaps) along which electrical charges

(electrons) flow powered by an energy source.

Electric Circuits - Grade 10

10.1 Electric Circuits

In South Africa, people depend on electricity to provide power for most appliances in the home,

at work and out in the world in general. For example, flourescent lights, electric heating and

cooking (on electric stoves), all depend on electricity to work. To realise just how big an impact

electricity has on our daily lives, just think about what happens when there is a power failure or

load shedding.

Activity :: Discussion : Uses of electricity

With a partner, take the following topics and, for each topic, write down at least 5

items/appliances/machines which need electricity to work. Try not to use the same

item more than once.

• At home

• At school

• At the hospital

• In the city

Once you have finished making your lists, compare with the lists of other people in

your class. (Save your lists somewhere safe for later because there will be another

activity for which you'll need them.)

When you start comparing, you should notice that there are many different items

which we use in our daily lives which rely on electricity to work!

Important: Safety Warning: We believe in experimenting and learning about physics at

every opportunity, BUT playing with electricity can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Do

not try to build home made circuits alone. Make sure you have someone with you who knows

if what you are doing is safe. Normal electrical outlets are dangerous. Treat electricity with

respect in your everyday life.
