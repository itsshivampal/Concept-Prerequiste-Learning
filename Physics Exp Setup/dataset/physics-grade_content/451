29.4.2 The Light Emitting Diode (LED)

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a diode device that emits light when charge flows in the correct

direction through it. If you apply a voltage to force current to flow in the direction the LED

allows it will light up.

Extension: Circuit Symbols

This notation of having two small arrows pointing away from the device is

common to the schematic symbols of all light-emitting semiconductor devices.

Conversely, if a device is light-activated (meaning that incoming light stimulates

it), then the symbol will have two small arrows pointing toward it. It is interesting

to note, though, that LEDs are capable of acting as light-sensing devices: they will

generate a small voltage when exposed to light, much like a solar cell on a small

scale. This property can be gainfully applied in a variety of light-sensing circuits.

The color depends on the semiconducting material used to construct the LED, and can be in

the near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Light emission

The wavelength of the light emitted, and therefore its color, depends on the materials forming

the p-n junction. A normal diode, typically made of silicon or germanium, emits invisible

far-infrared light (so it can't be seen), but the materials used for an LED have emit light

corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet frequencies.

LED applications

LEDs have many uses. Some of these are given here.

• thin, lightweight message displays, e.g. in public information signs (at airports and

railway stations, among other places)

• status indicators, e.g. on/off lights on professional instruments and consumers

audio/video equipment

• infrared LEDs in remote controls (for TVs, VCRs, etc)

• clusters of LEDs are used in traffic signals, replacing ordinary bulbs behind colored glass

• car indicator lights and bicycle lighting

• calculator and measurement instrument displays (seven segment displays), although now

mostly replaced by LCDs

• red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and [alpha]numeric displays in environments

where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges,

astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military

field use

• red or yellow LEDs are also used in photographic darkrooms, for providing lighting which

does not lead to unwanted exposure of the film

• illumination, e.g. flashlights (a.k.a. torches, UK), and backlighting for LCD screens

• signaling/emergency beacons and strobes

• movement sensors, e.g. in mechanical and optical computer mice and trackballs

• in LED printers, e.g. high-end color printers

LEDs offer benefits in terms of maintenance and safety.

• The typical working lifetime of a device, including the bulb, is ten years, which is much

longer than the lifetimes of most other light sources.

• LEDs fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs.

• LEDs give off less heat than incandescent light bulbs and are less fragile than fluorescent

lamps.

• Since an individual device is smaller than a centimetre in length, LED-based light sources

used for illumination and outdoor signals are built using clusters of tens of devices.

Because they are monochromatic, LED lights have great power advantages over white lights

where a specific color is required. Unlike the white lights, the LED does not need a filter that

absorbs most of the emitted white light. Colored fluorescent lights are made, but they are not

widely available. LED lights are inherently colored, and are available in a wide range of colors.

One of the most recently introduced colors is the emerald green (bluish green, about 500 nm)

that meets the legal requirements for traffic signals and navigation lights.

CHAPTER 29. ELECTRONICS - GRADE 12 29.4

There are applications that specifically require light that does not contain any blue component.

Examples are photographic darkroom safe lights, illumination in laboratories where certain

photo-sensitive chemicals are used, and situations where dark adaptation (night vision) must be

preserved, such as cockpit and bridge illumination, observatories, etc. Yellow LED lights are a

good choice to meet these special requirements because the human eye is more sensitive to

yellow light.
