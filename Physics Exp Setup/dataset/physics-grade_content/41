11. [SC 2002/11 SG] A car is driven at 25 m·s−1 in a municipal area. When the driver sees a
traffic officer at a speed trap, he realises he is travelling too fast. He immediately applies
the brakes of the car while still 100 m away from the speed trap.
(a) Calculate the magnitude of the minimum acceleration which the car must have to
avoid exceeding the speed limit, if the municipal speed limit is 16.6 m·s−1.
(b) Calculate the time from the instant the driver applied the brakes until he reaches the
speed trap. Assume that the car's velocity, when reaching the trap, is 16.6 m·s−1.
12. A traffic officer is watching his speed trap equipment at the bottom of a valley. He can
see cars as they enter the valley 1 km to his left until they leave the valley 1 km to his
right. Nelson is recording the times of cars entering and leaving the valley for a school
project. Nelson notices a white Toyota enter the valley at 11:01:30 and leave the valley at
11:02:42. Afterwards, Nelson hears that the traffic officer recorded the Toyota doing 140
km·hr−1.
(a) What was the time interval (∆t) for the Toyota to travel through the valley?
(b) What was the average speed of the Toyota?
(c) Convert this speed to km·hr−1.
(d) Discuss whether the Toyota could have been travelling at 140km·hr−1 at the bottom
of the valley.
(e) Discuss the differences between the instantaneous speed (as measured by the speed
trap) and average speed (as measured by Nelson).

13. [IEB 2003/11HG] A velocity-time graph for a ball rolling along a track is shown below.
The graph has been divided up into 3 sections, A, B and C for easy reference. (Disregard
any effects of friction.)

(a) Use the graph to determine the following:
i. the speed 5 s after the start
ii. the distance travelled in Section A
iii. the acceleration in Section C
(b) At time t1 the velocity-time graph intersects the time axis. Use an appropriate
equation of motion to calculate the value of time t1 (in s).
(c) Sketch a displacement-time graph for the motion of the ball for these 12 s. (You do
not need to calculate the actual values of the displacement for each time interval,
but do pay attention to the general shape of this graph during each time interval.)
14. In towns and cities, the speed limit is 60 km·hr−1. The length of the average car is 3.5
m, and the width of the average car is 2 m. In order to cross the road, you need to be
able to walk further than the width of a car, before that car reaches you. To cross safely,
you should be able to walk at least 2 m further than the width of the car (4 m in total),
before the car reaches you.
(a) If your walking speed is 4 km·hr−1, what is your walking speed in m·s−1?
(b) How long does it take you to walk a distance equal to the width of the average car?
(c) What is the speed in m·s−1 of a car travelling at the speed limit in a town?
(d) How many metres does a car travelling at the speed limit travel, in the same time
that it takes you to walk a distance equal to the width of car?
(e) Why is the answer to the previous question important?
(f) If you see a car driving toward you, and it is 28 m away (the same as the length of 8
cars), is it safe to walk across the road?
(g) How far away must a car be, before you think it might be safe to cross? How many
car-lengths is this distance?
15. A bus on a straight road starts from rest at a bus stop and accelerates at 2 m·s−2 until it
reaches a speed of 20 m·s−1. Then the bus travels for 20 s at a constant speed until the
driver sees the next bus stop in the distance. The driver applies the brakes, stopping the
bus in a uniform manner in 5 s.
(a) How long does the bus take to travel from the first bus stop to the second bus stop?
(b) What is the average velocity of the bus during the trip?

4.1 Weight

Weight is the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on any object. The weight of an objects

gives you an indication of how strongly the Earth attracts that body towards its centre. Weight

is calculated as follows:

Weight = mg

where m = mass of the object (in kg)

and g = the acceleration due to gravity (9,8 m·s−2)

For example, what is Sarah's weight if her mass is 50 kg. Sarah's

weight is calculated according to:

Weight = mg

= (50 kg)(9,8m · s−2)

= 490 kg · m · s−2

= 490 N

Important: Weight is sometimes abbreviated as Fg which refers to the force of gravity. Do

not use the abbreviation 'W' for weight as it refers to 'Work'.

Now, we have said that the value of g is approximately 9,8 m·s−2on the surface of the Earth.

The actual value varies slightly over the surface of the Earth. Each planet in our Solar System

has its own value for g. These values are listed as multiples of g on Earth in Table 4.1

Worked Example 15: Determining mass and weight on other planets

Question: Sarah's mass on Earth is 50 kg. What is her mass and weight on Mars?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what information is given and what is asked

m (on Earth) = 50 kg

m (on Mars) = ?

Weight (on Mars) = ?
