2.5 Rounding, Scientific Notation and Significant Figures

2.5.1 Rounding Off

Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is

that impossible, but writing numbers out to a high accuracy (many decimal places) is very

inconvenient and rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number to a

certain number of decimal places. Rounding off or approximating a decimal number to a given

number of decimal places is the quickest way to approximate a number. For example, if you

wanted to round-off 2,6525272 to three decimal places then you would first count three places

after the decimal.

2,652|5272

All numbers to the right of | are ignored after you determine whether the number in the third

decimal place must be rounded up or rounded down. You round up the final digit (make the

digit one more) if the first digit after the | was greater or equal to 5 and round down (leave the

digit alone) otherwise. So, since the first digit after the | is a 5, we must round up the digit in

the third decimal place to a 3 and the final answer of 2,6525272 rounded to three decimal places

is 2,653.

Worked Example 1: Rounding-off

Question: Round-off π = 3,141592654 . . . to 4 decimal places.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine the last digit that is kept and mark the cut-off with |.

π = 3,1415|92654 . . .

Step 2 : Determine whether the last digit is rounded up or down.

The last digit of π = 3,1415|92654 . . .must be rounded up because there is a 9 after

the |.

Step 3 : Write the final answer.

π = 3,1416 rounded to 4 decimal places.

CHAPTER 2. UNITS 2.5

Worked Example 2: Rounding-off

Question: Round-off 9,191919 . . . to 2 decimal places

Answer

Step 1 : Determine the last digit that is kept and mark the cut-off with |.

9,19|1919 . . .

Step 2 : Determine whether the last digit is rounded up or down.

The last digit of 9,19|1919 . . . must be rounded down because there is a 1 after

the |.

Step 3 : Write the final answer.

Answer = 9,19 rounded to 2 decimal places.

2.5.2 Error Margins

In a calculation that has many steps, it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end. For

example, Jack and Jill walks to school. They walk 0,9 kilometers to get to school and it takes

them 17 minutes. We can calculate their speed in the following two ways.

Method 1 Method 2

Change 17 minutes to hours: Change 17 minutes to hours:

time = 1760 time =

= 3,176470588 = 3,214285714

3,18 km·hr−1 3,21 km·hr−1

Table 2.3: Rounding numbers

You will see that we get two different answers. In Method 1 no rounding was done, but in Method

2, the time was rounded to 2 decimal places. This made a big difference to the answer. The

answer in Method 1 is more accurate because rounded numbers were not used in the calculation.

Always only round off your final answer.

2.5.3 Scientific Notation

In Science one often needs to work with very large or very small numbers. These can be written

more easily in scientific notation, in the general form

d× 10e

where d is a decimal number between 0 and 10 that is rounded off to a few decimal places. e is

known as the exponent and is an integer. If e > 0 it represents how many times the decimal

place in d should be moved to the right. If e < 0, then it represents how many times the decimal

place in d should be moved to the left. For example 3,24 × 103 represents 3240 (the decimal

moved three places to the right) and 3,24× 10−3 represents 0,00324 (the decimal moved three

places to the left).

If a number must be converted into scientific notation, we need to work out how many times

the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it into a number between 1 and 10

(i.e. the value of e) and what this number between 1 and 10 is (the value of d). We do this by

counting the number of decimal places the decimal comma must move.

For example, write the speed of light in scientific notation, to two decimal places. The speed of

light is 299 792 458 m·s−1. First, find where the decimal comma must go for two decimal places

(to find d) and then count how many places there are after the decimal comma to determine e.
