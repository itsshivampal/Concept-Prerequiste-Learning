31.4.4 Applications of emission and absorption spectra

The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is called spectroscopy. Spectroscopy

is a tool widely used in astronomy to learn different things about astronomical objects.

Identifying elements in astronomical objects using their spectra

Measuring the spectrum of light from a star can tell astronomers what the star is made of!

Since each element emits or absorbs light only at particular wavelengths, astronomers can

identify what elements are in the stars from the lines in their spectra. From studying the

spectra of many stars we know that there are many different types of stars which contain

different elements and in different amounts.

Determining velocities of galaxies using spectroscopy

You have already learned in Chapter 24 about the Doppler effect and how the frequency (and

wavelength) of sound waves changes depending on whether the object emitting the sound is

moving towards or away from you. The same thing happens to electromagnetic radiation. If

the object emitting the light is moving towards us, then the wavelength of the light appears

shorter (called blue-shifted). If the object is moving away from us, then the wavelength of its

light appears stretched out (called red-shifted).

The Doppler effect affects the spectra of objects in space depending on their motion relative to

us on the earth. For example, the light from a distant galaxy, which is moving away from us at

some velocity, will appear red-shifted. This means that the emission and absorption lines in the

galaxy's spectrum will be shifted to a longer wavelength (lower frequency). Knowing where

each line in the spectrum would normally be if the galaxy was not moving, and comparing to

their red-shifted positions, allows astronomers to precisely measure the velocity of the galaxy

relative to the earth!

Global warming and greenhouse gases

The sun emits radiation (light) over a range of wavelengths which are mainly in the visible part

of the spectrum. Radiation at these wavelengths passes through the gases of the atmosphere

to warm the land and the oceans below. The warm earth then radiates this heat at longer

infrared wavelengths. Carbon-dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere

has energy levels which correspond to the infrared wavelengths which allow it to absorb the

infrared radiation. It then also emits at infrared wavelengths in all directions. This effect stops

a large amount of the infrared radiation getting out of the atmosphere, which causes the

atmosphere and the earth to heat up. More radiation is coming in than is getting back out.

earth radiates long wavelength infrared radiation

Therefore increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases the amount

of trapped infrared radiation and therefore the overall temperature of the earth. The earth is a

very sensitive and complicated system upon which life depends and changing the delicate

balances of temperature and atmospheric gas content may have disastrous consequences if we

are not careful.
