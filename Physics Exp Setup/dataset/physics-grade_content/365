22.2.1 Hooke's Law

Deformation (change of shape) of a solid is caused by a force that can either be compressive or

tensile when applied in one direction (plane). Compressive forces try to compress the object

(make it smaller or more compact) while tensile forces try to tear it apart. We can study these

effects by looking at what happens when you compress or expand a spring.

Hooke's Law describes the relationship between the force applied to a spring and its extension.

Historical Note: Hooke's Law

Hooke's law is named after the seventeenth century physicist Robert Hooke who discovered

it in 1660 (18 July 1635 - 3 March 1703).

Definition: Hooke's Law

In an elastic spring, the extension varies linearly with the force applied.

F = −kx where F is the force in newtons (N), k is the spring constant in N ·m−1 and x

is the extension in metres (m).

Activity :: Experiment : Hooke's Law

Aim:

Verify Hooke's Law.

Apparatus:

• weights

• spring

• ruler

Method:

1. Set up a spring vertically in such a way that you are able to hang weights

from it.

2. Measure the extension of the spring for a range of different weights.

3. Draw a table of force (weight) in newtons and corresponding extension.

4. Draw a graph of force versus extension for your experiment.

Conclusions:

1. What do you observe about the relationship between the applied force and

the extension?

2. Determine the gradient of the graph.

3. Hence, calculate the spring constant for your spring.
