31.2.3 Why is the sky blue?

The sun emits light in many different wavelengths, including all of the visible wavelengths.

Light which is made up of all the visible wavelengths appears white. So what causes the sky to

look blue?

The air is not just full of nitrogen and oxygen gases. It is also full of tiny dust grains. The light

from the sun scatters off these many dust grains.

The chance that the light will scatter off one of these dust grains is bigger for shorter

wavelengths. The short wavelength blue light is therefore scattered much more than the other

colors. At noon, when the light from the sun is coming straight down (see the picture below),

the scattered blue light reaches your eyes from all directions and so the sky appears blue. The

other wavelengths do not get scattered much and therefore miss your line of sight. At sunrise

or sunset, the direction of the light coming from the sun is now straight towards your eyes (see

picture below). Therefore the scattered blue light can't be seen because it is scattered out of

your line of sight. The redder colours (oranges and reds) can now be seen because they are not

scattered as much and still fall in your line of sight.

Questions:

1. Which object was the hottest and what was it made of?

2. Which object was the coolest and what was it made of?

3. How did the temperatures of the black and white objects compare to each

other? (which one was hotter and which was cooler?)

4. Try to explain the reasons for the different temperatures of the objects with

respect to their colours and the materials of which they are made.

Metals generally reflect most wavelengths of visible light, but they will reflect the light in a

certain direction, given by the laws of reflection in geometrical optics. This is different to most

materials, like wood or fabric, which reflect light in all directions. Metals have this property

since they have electrons that are not bound to atoms and can move freely through the metal.

This is unlike most other materials that have their electrons bound closely to the atoms. These

free electrons in metals can then absorb and reflect photons of a wide range of energies.

Ultraviolet light (which has shorter wavelengths than visible light) will pass through some

substances, such as many plastics, because they do not have the right energy levels to absorb it

and re-emit it. X-rays (also short wavelengths) will also pass through most materials, since the

energies of X-rays correspond to the energy levels of atomic nuclei. Such nuclei are much

smaller than atoms, so it is much less likely for an X-ray to hit a nucleus instead of the whole

atom.

Most materials will absorb infrared radiation (longer wavelengths than visible light), since the

energies of that radiation often correspond to rotational or vibrational energy levels of

molecules.
