11.6 Mathematical Properties of Vectors

Vectors are mathematical objects and we need to understand the mathematical properties of

vectors, like adding and subtracting.

For all the examples in this section, we will use displacement as our vector quantity. Displacement

was discussed in Chapter 3. Displacement is defined as the distance together with direction of

the straight line joining a final point to an initial point.

Remember that displacement is just one example of a vector. We could just as well have decided

to use forces or velocities to illustrate the properties of vectors.
