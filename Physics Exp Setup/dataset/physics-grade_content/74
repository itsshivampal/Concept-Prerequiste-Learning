6.2 What is a transverse wave?

We have studied pulses in Chapter 5, and know that a pulse is a single disturbance that travels

through a medium. A wave is a periodic, continuous disturbance that consists of a train of

pulses.

A wave is a periodic, continuous disturbance that consists of a train of pulses.

Definition: Transverse wave

A transverse wave is a wave where the movement of the particles of the medium is perpen-

dicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.

Activity :: Investigation : Transverse Waves

Take a rope or slinky spring. Have two people hold the rope or spring stretched

out horizontally. Flick the one end of the rope up and down continuously to create

a train of pulses.

Flick rope up and down

1. Describe what happens to the rope.

2. Draw a diagram of what the rope looks like while the pulses travel along it.

3. In which direction do the pulses travel?

4. Tie a ribbon to the middle of the rope. This indicates a particle in the rope.

Flick rope up and down

5. Flick the rope continuously. Watch the ribbon carefully as the pulses travel

through the rope. What happens to the ribbon?

6. Draw a picture to show the motion of the ribbon. Draw the ribbon as a dot

and use arrows.

In the Activity, you have created waves. The medium through which these waves propagated

was the rope, which is obviously made up of a very large number of particles (atoms). From the

activity, you would have noticed that the wave travelled from left to right, but the particles (the

ribbon) moved only up and down.

wave motion

Figure 6.1: A transverse wave, showing the direction of motion of the wave perpendicular to the

direction in which the particles move.

When the particles of a medium move at right angles to the direction of propagation of a wave,

the wave is called transverse. For waves, there is no net displacement of the particles (they

return to their equilibrium position), but there is a net displacement of the wave. There are thus

two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave.

6.1 Introduction

Waves occur frequently in nature. The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in

the ocean, or in a bucket. We are most interested in the properties that waves have. All waves

have the same properties, so if we study waves in water, then we can transfer our knowledge to

predict how other examples of waves will behave.
