10.3.3 Series Circuits

In a series circuit, the charge has a single path from the battery, returning to the battery.

The arrows in this picture show you the direction that charge will flow in the circuit. They don't

show you much charge will flow, only the direction.

Itneterreessttinigng Benjamin Franklin made a guess about the direction of charge flow when rubbing

FFacctt smooth wax with rough wool. He thought that the charges flowed from the wax to

the wool (i.e. from positive to negative) which was opposite to the real direction.

Due to this, electrons are said to have a negative charge and so objects which Ben

Franklin called "negative" (meaning a shortage of charge) really have an excess

of electrons. By the time the true direction of electron flow was discovered, the

convention of "positive" and "negative" had already been so well accepted in the

scientific world that no effort was made to change it.

Important: A cell does not produce the same amount of current no matter what is

connected to it. While the voltage produced by a cell is constant, the amount of current

supplied depends on what is in the circuit.

How does the current through the battery in a circuit with several resistors in series compare to

the current in a circuit with a single resistor?

Method:

1. Construct the following circuits

2. Rank the three circuits in terms of the brightness of the bulb.

Conclusions:

The brightness of the bulb is an indicator of how much current is flowing. If the

bulb gets brighter because of a change then more current is flowing. If the bulb gets

dimmer less current is flowing. You will find that the more resistors you have the

dimmer the bulb.
