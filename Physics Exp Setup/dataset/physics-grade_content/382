23.3.2 Capacity to do Work

Energy is the capacity to do work. When positive work is done on an object, the system doing

the work loses energy. In fact, the energy lost by a system is exactly equal to the work

done by the system. An object with larger potential energy has a greater capacity to do work.

Worked Example 152: Work Done on a System

Question: Show that a hammer of mass 2 kg does more work when dropped from

a height of 10 m than when dropped from a height of 5 m. Confirm that the

hammer has a greater potential energy at 10 m than at 5 m.

Answer

Step 5 : Determine what is given and what is required

We are given:

• the mass of the hammer, m =2 kg

• height 1, h1=10 m

• height 2, h2=5 m

We are required to show that the hammer does more work when dropped from h1

than from h2. We are also required to confirm that the hammer has a greater

potential energy at 10 m than at 5 m.

Step 6 : Determine how to approach the problem

1. Calculate the work done by the hammer, W1, when dropped from h1 using:

W1 = Fg · h1.

2. Calculate the work done by the hammer, W2, when dropped from h2 using:

W2 = Fg · h2.

3. Compare W1 and W2

4. Calculate potential energy at h1 and h2 and compare using:

PE = m · g · h. (23.2)

Step 7 : Calculate W1

W1 = Fg · h1

= m · g · h1

= (2 kg)(9.8m · s−2)(10m)

= 196 J

Step 8 : Calculate W2

W2 = Fg · h2

= m · g · h2

= (2 kg)(9.8m · s−2)(5m)

= 98 J

CHAPTER 23. WORK, ENERGY AND POWER - GRADE 12 23.3

Step 9 : Compare W1 and W2

We have W1=196 J and W2=98 J. W1 > W2 as required.

Step 10 : Calculate potential energy

From 23.2, we see that:

PE = m · g · h

= Fg · h

= W

This means that the potential energy is equal to the work done. Therefore,

PE1 > PE2, because W1 > W2.

This leads us to the work-energy theorem.

Definition: Work-Energy Theorem

The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in

its kinetic energy:

W = ∆KE = KEf −KEi

The work-energy theorem is another example of the conservation of energy which you saw in

Grade 10.

Worked Example 153: Work-Energy Theorem

Question: A ball of mass 1 kg is dropped from a height of 10 m. Calculate the

work done on the ball at the point it hits the ground assuming that there is no air

resistance?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

We are given:

• mass of the ball: m=1 kg

• initial height of the ball: hi=10 m

• final height of the ball: hf=0 m

We are required to determine the work done on the ball as it hits the ground.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

The ball is falling freely, so energy is conserved. We know that the work done is

equal to the difference in kinetic energy. The ball has no kinetic energy at the

moment it is dropped, because it is stationary. When the ball hits the ground, all

the ball's potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.

Step 3 : Determine the ball's potential energy at hi

PE = m · g · h

= (1 kg)(9,8m · s−2)(10m)

= 98 J

Step 4 : Determine the work done on the ball

The ball had 98 J of potential energy when it was released and 0 J of kinetic

energy. When the ball hit the ground, it had 0 J of potential energy and 98 J of

kinetic energy. Therefore KEi=0 J and KEf=98 J.

Worked Example 154: Work-Energy Theorem 2
Question: The driver of a 1 000 kg car traveling at a speed of 16,7 m·s−1 applies
the car's brakes when he sees a red robot. The car's brakes provide a frictional
force of 8000 N. Determine the stopping distance of the car.
Answer
Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required
We are given:
• mass of the car: m=1 000 kg
• speed of the car: v=16,7 m·s−1
• frictional force of brakes: F=8 000 N
We are required to determine the stopping distance of the car.
Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem
We apply the work-energy theorem. We know that all the car's kinetic energy is
lost to friction. Therefore, the change in the car's kinetic energy is equal to the
work done by the frictional force of the car's brakes.
Therefore, we first need to determine the car's kinetic energy at the moment of
braking using:
1
KE = mv2
2
This energy is equal to the work done by the brakes. We have the force applied by
the brakes, and we can use:
W = F · d
to determine the stopping distance.
Step 3 : Determine the kinetic energy of the car
1
KE = mv2
2
1
= (1 000 kg)(16,7m · s−1)2
2
= 139 445 J
Step 4 : Determine the work done
Assume the stopping distance is d0. Then the work done is:
W = F · d
= (−8 000N)(d0)
The force has a negative sign because it acts in a direction opposite to the
direction of motion.
Step 5 : Apply the work-enemy theorem
The change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done.
522
CHAPTER 23. WORK, ENERGY AND POWER - GRADE 12 23.3
∆KE = W
KEf −KEi = (−8 000N)(d0)
0 J− 139 445 J = (−8 000N)(d0)
139 445 J
∴ d0 =
8 000N
= 17,4m
Step 6 : Write the final answer
The car stops in 17,4 m.
Important: A force only does work on an object for the time that it is in contact with the
object. For example, a person pushing a trolley does work on the trolley, but the road does
no work on the tyres of a car if they turn without slipping (the force is not applied over any
distance because a different piece of tyre touches the road every instant.
Energy is
conserved!
Important: Energy Conservation
In the absence of friction, the work done on an object by a system is equal to the energy
gained by the object.
Work Done = Energy Transferred
In the presence of friction, only some of the energy lost by the system is transferred to useful
energy. The rest is lost to friction.
Total Work Done = Useful Work Done + Work Done Against Friction
In the example of a falling mass the potential energy is known as gravitational potential energy
as it is the gravitational force exerted by the earth which causes the mass to accelerate towards
the ground. The gravitational field of the earth is what does the work in this case.
Another example is a rubber-band. In order to stretch a rubber-band we have to do work on it.
This means we transfer energy to the rubber-band and it gains potential energy. This potential
energy is called elastic potential energy. Once released, the rubber-band begins to move and
elastic potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy.
Extension: Other forms of Potential Energy
1. elastic potential energy - potential energy is stored in a compressed or
extended spring or rubber band. This potential energy is calculated by:
1
kx2
2
where k is a constant that is a measure of the stiffness of the spring or rubber
band and x is the extension of the spring or rubber band.
2. Chemical potential energy is related to the making and breaking of chemical
bonds. For example, a battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
3. The electrical potential energy of an electrically charged object is defined as
the work that must be done to move it from an infinite distance away to its
present location, in the absence of any non-electrical forces on the object.
523
23.3 CHAPTER 23. WORK, ENERGY AND POWER - GRADE 12
This energy is non-zero if there is another electrically charged object nearby
otherwise it is given by:
q1q2
k
d
where k is Coulomb's constant. For example, an electric motor lifting an
elevator converts electrical energy into gravitational potential energy.
4. Nuclear energy is the energy released when the nucleus of an atom is split or
fused. A nuclear reactor converts nuclear energy into heat.
Some of these forms of energy will be studied in later chapters.
Activity :: Investigation : Energy Resources
Energy can be taken from almost anywhere. Power plants use many different
types of energy sources, including oil, coal, nuclear, biomass (organic gases), wind,
solar, geothermal (the heat from the earth's rocks is very hot underground and is
used to turn water to steam), tidal and hydroelectric (waterfalls). Most power
stations work by using steam to turn turbines which then drive generators and
create an electric current.
Most of these sources are dependant upon the sun's energy, because without it
we would not have weather for wind and tides. The sun is also responsible for
growing plants which decompose into fossil fuels like oil and coal. All these sources
can be put under 2 headings, renewable and non-renewable. Renewable sources are
sources which will not run out, like solar energy and wind power. Non-renewable
sources are ones which will run out eventually, like oil and coal.
It is important that we learn to appreciate conservation in situations like this.
The planet has a number of linked systems and if we don't appreciate the
long-term consequences of our actions we run the risk of doing damage now that
we will only suffer from in many years time.
