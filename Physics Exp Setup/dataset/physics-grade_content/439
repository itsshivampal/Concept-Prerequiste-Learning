28.4.2 Inductance

An inductor is a passive electrical device used in electrical circuits for its property of

inductance. An inductor is usually made as a coil (or solenoid) of conducting material, typically

copper wire, wrapped around a core either of air or of ferromagnetic material.

Electrical current through the conductor creates a magnetic flux proportional to the current. A

change in this current creates a change in magnetic flux that, in turn, generates an emf that

acts to oppose this change in current.

Inductance (measured in henries, symbol H) is a measure of the generated emf for a unit

change in current. For example, an inductor with an inductance of 1 H produces an emf of 1 V

when the current through the inductor changes at the rate of 1 A·s−1.

The inductance of an inductor is determined by several factors:

• the shape of the coil; a short, fat coil has a higher inductance than one that is thin and

tall.

• the material that conductor is wrapped around.

• how the conductor is wound; winding in opposite directions will cancel out the

inductance effect, and you will have only a resistor.

The inductance of a solenoid is defined by:

L = µ0AN

l

where µ0 is the permeability of the core material (in this case air), A is the cross-sectional area

of the solenoid, N is the number of turns and l is the length of the solenoid.

Definition: Permeability

Permeability is the property of a material which describes the magnetisation developed in

that material when excited by a source.

An inductor in an AC circuit also has a reactance, XL that is defined by:

XL = 2πfL

where L is the inductance and f is the frequency of the AC.

If we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor, we see that inductive reactance

increases with increasing frequency. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the inductive

reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low frequency AC

because its reactance decreases with decreasing frequency.

When the frequency is high, the inductive reactance is high. This is why an inductor blocks the

flow of high frequency AC because its reactance increases with increasing frequency.
