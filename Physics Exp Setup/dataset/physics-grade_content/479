31.2.2 Interaction of light with metals

When light encounters or passes through a material, the photons of the light interact with the

atoms or molecules of the material. Depending on the strength of the interactions and how

often they happen, the light will pass through the material or be scattered in some other

direction.

Each wavelength of light relates to a particular energy, and the closer that energy is to the

energy difference between two of the levels of the atom, the likelier the photon is to interact

with the atom.

When visible or ultraviolet (UV) radiation shines on a metal, the photons are absorbed by the

electrons in the metal. The electrons are then excited up to a higher energy level. When an

electron returns to a lower energy level, another photon is emitted. This is how light is

reflected off a metal surface.

In previous chapters, you have studied geometrical optics, which tells us what happens to rays

of light when they are reflected off a surface or refracted through a lens. That tells us what

happens to light rays, made up of many photons, on a large scale. If you look at a smaller

level, i.e. on a microscopic scale, then reflection and refraction happen by all the photons

interacting with the atoms of the lens or mirror. The photons get absorbed and re-emitted

many times before emerging as the finals rays of light that we see.

Scattering of light is responsible for many effects in everyday life. We see that certain materials

are red or blue, for example, since they contain materials that have energy level differences that

correspond to the energies of the photons that make up red or blue light. These materials then

reflect the red or blue light and absorb the other wavelengths in the visible spectrum. White

objects reflect photons of all wavelengths in the visual spectrum, while black objects absorb

these photons.

Itneterreessttinigng Because a truly black object absorbs all the visual wavelengths of light, and

FFacctt does not re-emit photons at visual wavelengths, we can say that 'black' is not a

colour itself, but rather a lack of colour! Also, since black objects absorb visual

light, they heat up more than objects of other colours which reflect light at

certain wavelengths.

Activity :: Investigation : Reflection and absorption

Aim:

Investigate the interaction of light with differently coloured metal objects

Apparatus:

Find some differently coloured metal objects (at least 5) which will not be

damaged if left in the sun for 15 minutes. Make sure to include at least one white

item and one black item.

Method:

At the start of your lesson set out your objects in direct sunlight. Leave them there

for around 15 minutes.

Alternatively, if it is a sunny day, you can use your teachers' cars for this

experiment - as long as there are some cars of different colours and they have been

standing in direct sunlight for the same length of time!

After 15 minutes is up, touch each of the items/cars (be careful not to burn

yourself!) and compare their temperatures (rate them from 1 to 5 with 1 being

cold and 5 being very hot) in a table such as the example table below:

Questions:

1. Which object was the hottest and what was it made of?

2. Which object was the coolest and what was it made of?

3. How did the temperatures of the black and white objects compare to each

other? (which one was hotter and which was cooler?)

4. Try to explain the reasons for the different temperatures of the objects with

respect to their colours and the materials of which they are made.

Metals generally reflect most wavelengths of visible light, but they will reflect the light in a

certain direction, given by the laws of reflection in geometrical optics. This is different to most

materials, like wood or fabric, which reflect light in all directions. Metals have this property

since they have electrons that are not bound to atoms and can move freely through the metal.

This is unlike most other materials that have their electrons bound closely to the atoms. These

free electrons in metals can then absorb and reflect photons of a wide range of energies.

Ultraviolet light (which has shorter wavelengths than visible light) will pass through some

substances, such as many plastics, because they do not have the right energy levels to absorb it

and re-emit it. X-rays (also short wavelengths) will also pass through most materials, since the

energies of X-rays correspond to the energy levels of atomic nuclei. Such nuclei are much

smaller than atoms, so it is much less likely for an X-ray to hit a nucleus instead of the whole

atom.

Most materials will absorb infrared radiation (longer wavelengths than visible light), since the

energies of that radiation often correspond to rotational or vibrational energy levels of

molecules.
