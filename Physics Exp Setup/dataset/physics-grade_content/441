alternator.

An inductor in an AC circuit also has a reactance, XL that is defined by:

XL = 2πfL

where L is the inductance and f is the frequency of the AC.

If we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor, we see that inductive reactance

increases with increasing frequency. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the inductive

reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low frequency AC

because its reactance decreases with decreasing frequency.

When the frequency is high, the inductive reactance is high. This is why an inductor blocks the

flow of high frequency AC because its reactance increases with increasing frequency.
