30.6.2 Ultraviolet radiation and the eyes

High intensities of UVB light are hazardous to the eyes, and exposure can cause welder's flash

(photo keratitis or arc eye) and may lead to cataracts, pterygium and pinguecula formation.

Protective eyewear is beneficial to those who are working with or those who might be exposed

to ultraviolet radiation, particularly short wave UV. Given that light may reach the eye from the

sides, full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure,

as in high altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of

UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from

snow and ice.

Ordinary, untreated eyeglasses give some protection. Most plastic lenses give more protection

than glass lenses. Some plastic lens materials, such as polycarbonate, block most UV. There

are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it which will give better

protection. But even a treatment that completely blocks UV will not protect the eye from light

that arrives around the lens. To convince yourself of the potential dangers of stray UV light,

cover your lenses with something opaque, like aluminum foil, stand next to a bright light, and

consider how much light you see, despite the complete blockage of the lenses. Most contact

lenses help to protect the retina by absorbing UV radiation.
