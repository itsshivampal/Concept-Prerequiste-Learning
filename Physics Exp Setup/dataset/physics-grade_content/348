21.2.1 Motion in a Gravitational Field

When an object is in a gravitational field, it always accelerates downwards with a constant

acceleration g whether the object is moving upward or downward. This is shown in Figure 21.1.

Important: Projectiles moving upwards or downwards always accelerate downwards with a

constant acceleration g.

Figure 21.1: Objects moving upwards or downwards, always accelerate downwards.

This means that if an object is moving upwards, it decreases until it stops (vf = 0 m·s−1).

This is the maximum height that the object reaches, because after this, the object starts to fall.

Important: Projectiles have zero velocity at their greatest height.

21.2 CHAPTER 21. MOTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS - GRADE 12

Consider an object thrown upwards from a vertical height ho. We have seen that the object

will travel upwards with decreasing velocity until it stops, at which point it starts falling. The

time that it takes for the object to fall down to height ho is the same as the time taken for the

object to reach its maximum height from height ho.

reaches its maximum height, and starts to fall. (c) After a time 2tm the object returns to height

Important: Projectiles take the same the time to reach their greatest height from the point

of upward launch as the time they take to fall back to the point of launch.

21.1 Introduction

In Chapter 3, we studied motion in one dimension and briefly looked at vertical motion. In this

chapter we will discuss vertical motion and also look at motion in two dimensions. In

Chapter 12, we studied the conservation of momentum and looked at applications in one

dimension. In this chapter we will look at momentum in two dimensions.

21.2 Vertical Projectile Motion

In Chapter 4, we studied the motion of objects in free fall and we saw that an object in free fall

falls with gravitational acceleration g. Now we can consider the motion of objects that are

thrown upwards and then fall back to the Earth. We call this projectile motion and we will only

consider the situation where the object is thrown straight upwards and then falls straight

downwards - this means that there is no horizontal displacement of the object, only a vertical

displacement.
