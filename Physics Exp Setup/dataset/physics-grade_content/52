4.5.1 Conservation of Mechanical Energy

The Law of Conservation of Energy states:

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but is merely changed from one form into

another.

Definition: Conservation of Energy

The Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but is merely

changed from one form into another.

So far we have looked at two types of energy: gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy.

The sum of the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy is called the mechanical energy.

In a closed system, one where there are no external forces acting, the mechanical energy will

remain constant. In other words, it will not change (become more or less). This is called the

Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy and it states:

The total amount of mechanical energy in a closed system remains constant.

Definition: Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy: The total amount of mechanical energy in a

closed system remains constant.

This means that potential energy can become kinetic energy, or vise versa, but energy cannot

'dissappear'. The mechanical energy of an object moving in the Earth's gravitational field (or

accelerating as a result of gravity) is constant or conserved, unless external forces, like air

resistance, acts on the object.

We can now use the conservation of mechanical energy to calculate the velocity of a body in

freefall and show that the velocity is independent of mass.

Important: In problems involving the use of conservation of energy, the path taken by

the object can be ignored. The only important quantities are the object's velocity (which

gives its kinetic energy) and height above the reference point (which gives its gravitational

potential energy).

Important: In the absence of friction, mechanical energy is conserved and

Ubefore = Uafter

In the presence of friction, mechanical energy is not conserved. The mechanical energy lost

is equal to the work done against friction.

∆U = Ubefore − Uafter = work done against friction

In general mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of external forces. Examples of external

forces are: applied forces, frictional forces, air resistance, tension, normal forces.

In the presence of internal forces like the force due to gravity or the force in a spring, mechanical

energy is conserved.

3. A car with a mass of 700 kg is travelling at a constant velocity of 100 km·hr−1.

Calculate the kinetic energy of the car.

4.5 Mechanical Energy

Important: Mechanical energy is the sum of the gravitational potential energy and the

kinetic energy.

Mechanical energy, U , is simply the sum of gravitational potential energy (PE) and the kinetic

energy (KE). Mechanical energy is defined as:

U = PE +KE (4.7)

U = PE +KE

U = mgh+ mv2 (4.8)
