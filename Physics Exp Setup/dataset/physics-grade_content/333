20.2.3 Semi-conductors

A semi-conductor is very similar to an insulator. The main difference between semiconductors

and insulators is the size of the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. The

band gap in insulators is larger than the band gap in semiconductors.

In semi-conductors at room temperature, just as in insulators, very few electrons gain enough

thermal energy to leap the band gap, which is necessary for conduction. For this reason, pure

semi-conductors and insulators, in the absence of applied fields, have roughly similar electrical

properties. The smaller band gaps of semi-conductors, however, allow for many other means

besides temperature to control their electrical properties. The most important one being that

for a certain amount of applied voltage, more current will flow in the semiconductor than in the

insulator.

Exercise: Conduction

1. Explain how energy levels of electrons in an atom combine with those of other

atoms in the formation of crystals.

2. Explain how the resulting energy levels are more closely spaced than those in

the individual atoms, forming energy bands.

3. Explain the existence of energy bands in metal crystals as the result of

superposition of energy levels.

4. Explain and contrast the conductivity of conductors, semi-conductors and

insulators using energy band theory.

5. What is the main difference in the energy arrangement between an isolated

atom and the atom in a solid?

6. What determines whether a solid is an insulator, a semiconductor, or a

conductor?
