25.4 Pigments and Paints

We have learnt that white light is a combination of all the colours of the visible spectrum and

that each colour of light is related to a different frequency. But what gives everyday objects

around us their different colours?

Pigments are substances which give an object its colour by absorbing certain frequencies of

light and reflecting other frequencies. For example, a red pigment absorbs all colours of light

except red which it reflects. Paints and inks contain pigments which gives the paints and inks

different colours.
