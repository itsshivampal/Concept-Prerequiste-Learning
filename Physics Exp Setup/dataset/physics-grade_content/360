21.6 Summary

1. Projectiles are objects that move through the air.

2. Objects that move up and down (vertical projectiles) accelerate with a constant

acceleration g which is more or less equal to 9,8 m·s−2.

3. The equations of motion can be used to solve vertical projectile problems.

vf = vi + gt

∆x = t

4. Graphs can be drawn for vertical projectile motion and are similar to the graphs for

motion at constant acceleration. If upwards is taken as positive the ∆x vs t, v vs t ans a

vs t graphs for an object being thrown upwards look like this:

h (m) v (m·s−1) a (m·s−2)

5. Momentum is conserved in one and two dimensions

p = mv

∆p = m∆v

∆p = F∆t

6. An elastic collision is a collision where both momentum and kinetic energy is conserved.

pbefore = pafter

KEbefore = KEafter

7. An inelastic collision is where momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not conserved.

pbefore = pafter

2. A boy is standing inside a train that is moving at 10 m·s−1to the left. The

boy throws a ball in the air with a velocity of 4 m·s−1. What is the resultant

velocity of the ball

A according to the boy?

B according to someone outside the train?
