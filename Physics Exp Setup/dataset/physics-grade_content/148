10.2.4 Ohm's Law

The voltage is the change in potential energy or work done when charge moves between two

points in the circuit. The greater the resistance to charge moving the more work that needs to

be done. The work done or voltage thus depends on the resistance. The potential difference is

proportional to the resistance.

Definition: Ohm's Law

Voltage across a circuit component is proportional to the resistance of the component.

Use the fact that voltage is proportional to resistance to calculate what proportion of the total

voltage of a circuit will be found across each circuit element.

We know that the total voltage is equal to V1 in the first circuit, to V1 + V2 in the second

circuit and V1 + V2 + V3 in the third circuit.

We know that the potential energy lost across a resistor is proportional to the resistance of the

component. The total potential difference is shared evenly across the total resistance of the

circuit. This means that the potential difference per unit of resistance is

Vtotal

Vper unit of resistance =

Rtotal

Then the voltage across a resistor is just the resistance times the potential difference per unit of

resistance

Vresistor = Rresistor · Vtotal .

10.2.3 Potential Difference and Series Resistors

When resistors are in series, one after the other, there is a potential difference across each

resistor. The total potential difference across a set of resistors in series is the sum of the

potential differences across each of the resistors in the set. This is the same as falling a large

distance under gravity or falling that same distance (difference) in many smaller steps. The total

distance (difference) is the same.

Look at the circuits below. If we measured the potential difference between the black dots in

all of these circuits it would be the same just like we saw above. So we now know the total

potential difference is the same across one, two or three resistors. We also know that some work

is required to make charge flow through each one, each is a step down in potential energy. These

steps add up to the total drop which we know is the difference between the two dots.

Let us look at this in a bit more detail. In the picture below you can see what the different

measurements for 3 identical resistors in series could look like. The total voltage across all three

resistors is the sum of the voltages across the individual resistors.
