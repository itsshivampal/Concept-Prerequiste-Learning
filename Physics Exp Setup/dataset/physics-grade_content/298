17.6.1 A capacitor in a circuit

When a capacitor is connected in a DC circuit, current will flow until the capacitor is fully

charged. After that, no further current will flow. If the charged capacitor is connected to

another circuit with no source of emf in it, the capacitor will discharge through the circuit,

creating a potential difference for a short time. This is useful, for example, in a camera flash.

Initially, the electrodes have no net charge. A voltage source is applied to charge a capacitor.

The voltage source creates an electric field, causing the electrons to move. The charges move

around the circuit stopping at the left electrode. Here they are unable to travel across the

dielectric, since electrons cannot travel through an insulator. The charge begins to accumulate,

and an electric field forms pointing from the left electrode to the right electrode. This is the

opposite direction of the electric field created by the voltage source. When this electric field is

equal to the electric field created by the voltage source, the electrons stop moving. The

capacitor is then fully charged, with a positive charge on the left electrode and a negative

charge on the right electrode.

If the voltage is removed, the capacitor will discharge. The electrons begin to move because in

the absence of the voltage source, there is now a net electric field. This field is due to the

imbalance of charge on the electrodes-the field across the dielectric. Just as the electrons

flowed to the positive electrode when the capacitor was being charged, during discharge, the

electrons flow to negative electrode. The charges cancel, and there is no longer an electric field

across the dielectric.

Exercise: Capacitance and the parallel plate capacitor

1. Determine the capacitance of a capacitor which stores 9× 10−9C when a

potential difference of 12 V is applied to it.

2. What charge will be stored on a 5µF capacitor if a potential difference of 6V

is maintained between its plates?

3. What is the capacitance of a capacitor that uses air as its dielectric if it has

an area of 0,004m2 and a distance of 0,03m between its plates?

4. What is the strength of the electric field between the plates of a charged

capacitor if the plates are 2mm apart and have a potential difference of 200V

across them?
