25.3.4 Perception of Colour

The light-sensitive lining on the back inside half of the human eye is called the retina. The

retina contains two kinds of light sensitive cells or photoreceptors: the rod cells (sensitive to

low light) and the cone cells (sensitive to normal daylight) which enable us to see. The rods

are not very sensitive to colour but work well in dimly lit conditions. This is why it is possible

to see in a dark room, but it is hard to see any colours. Only your rods are sensitive to the low

light levels and so you can only see in black, white and grey. The cones enable us to see

colours. Normally, there are three kinds of cones, each containing a different pigment. The

cones are activated when the pigments absorb light. The three types of cones are sensitive to

(i.e. absorb) red, blue and green light respectively. Therefore we can perceive all the different

colours in the visible spectrum when the different types of cones are stimulated by different

amounts since they are just combinations of the three primary colours of light.

The rods and cones have different response times to light. The cones react quickly when bright

light falls on them. The rods take a longer time to react. This is why it takes a while (about 10

minutes) for your eyes to adjust when you enter a dark room after being outside on a sunny day.

Itneterreessttinigng Color blindness in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some

FFacctt or all colors that other people can see. Most often it is a genetic problem, but

may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or due to exposure to

certain chemicals. The most common forms of human color blindness result

from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone

systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from

one another. This is called "red-green color blindness". Other forms of color

blindness are much rarer. They include problems in discriminating blues from

yellows, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or monochromasy,

where one cannot distinguish any color from grey, as in a black-and-white

movie or photograph.

Worked Example 162: Seeing Colours

Question: When blue and green light fall on an eye, is cyan light being created?

Discuss.

Answer

Cyan light is not created when blue and green light fall on the eye. The blue and

green receptors are stimulated to make the brain believe that cyan light is being

created.

25.3 CHAPTER 25. COLOUR - GRADE 12

1. How did your predictions match up to your measurements?

2. Complementary colours of light are defined as the colours of light which,

when added to one of the primary colours, produce white light. From your

completed table, write down the complementary colours for red, blue and

green.

25.3.3 Complementary Colours

Complementary colours are two colours of light which add together to give white.

Activity :: Investigation : Complementary colours for red, green and blue

Complementary colours are two colours which add together to give white. Place

a tick in the box where the colours in the first column added to the colours in the

top row give white.

You should have found that the complementary colours for red, green and blue are:

• Red and Cyan

• Green and Magenta

• Blue and Yellow
