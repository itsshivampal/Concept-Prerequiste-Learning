Principle of Conservation of Energy: Energy is never created nor destroyed, but is merely

transformed from one form to another.

Conservation of Mechanical Energy: In the absence of friction, the total mechanical energy

of an object is conserved.

When a force moves in the direction along which it acts, work is done.

Work is the process of converting energy.

Energy is the ability to do work.
