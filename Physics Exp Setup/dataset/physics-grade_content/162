10.5.4 Meters Impact on Circuit

A good quality meter used correctly will not significantly change the values it is used to measure.

This means that an ammeter has very low resistance to not slow down the flow of charge.

A voltmeter has a very high resistance so that it does not add another parallel pathway to the

circuit for the charge to flow along.

Activity :: Investigation : Using meters

If possible, connect meters in circuits to get used to the use of meters to measure

electrical quantities. If the meters have more than one scale, always connect to the

largest scale first so that the meter will not be damaged by having to measure

values that exceed its limits.

The table below summarises the use of each measuring instrument that we discussed and the

way it should be connected to a circuit component.
