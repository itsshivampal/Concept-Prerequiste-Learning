A Explain the meaning of each of these two statements:

i. "The current through the battery is 50 mA."

ii. "The emf of the battery is 6 V."

B A battery tester measures the current supplied when the battery is connected to a

resistor of 100 Ω. If the current is less than 50 mA, the battery is "flat" (it needs to

be replaced). Calculate the maximum internal resistance of a 6 V battery that will

pass the test.

sistance

Electric eels have a series of cells from head to tail. When the cells are activated by a
nerve impulse, a potential difference is created from head to tail. A healthy electric eel
can produce a potential difference of 600 V.

difference of 600 V?

Electronic Properties of Matter -

Grade 11

20.1 Introduction

We can study many different features of solids. Just a few of the things we could study are

how hard or soft they are, what are their magnetic properties or how well do they conduct heat.

The thing that we are interested in, in this chapter are their electronic properties. Simply how

well do they conduct electricity and how do they do it.

We are only going to discuss materials that form a 3-dimensional lattice. This means that the

atoms that make up the material have a regular pattern (carbon, silicon, etc.). We won't

discuss materials where the atoms are jumbled together in a irregular way (plastic, glass,

rubber etc.).

20.2 Conduction

We know that there are materials that do conduct electricity, called conductors, like the copper

wires in the circuits you build. There are also materials that do not conduct electricity, called

insulators, like the plastic covering on the copper wires.

Conductors come in two major categories: metals (e.g. copper) and semi-conductors (e.g.

silicon). Metals conduct very well and semi-conductors don't. One very interesting difference is

that metals conduct less as they become hotter but semi-conductors conduct more.

What is different about these substances that makes them conduct differently? That is what

we are about to find out.

We have learnt that electrons in an atom have discrete energy levels. When an electron is given

the right amount of energy, it can jump to a higher energy level, while if it loses the right

amount of energy it can drop to a lower energy level. The lowest energy level is known as the

ground state.
