31.5.1 How a laser works

The important process involved in how a laser works is stimulated emission - as you can tell

from what ‘laser' stands for! You can imagine that stimulated emission can lead to more and

more identical photons being released in the following way: Imagine we have an electron in an

excited metastable state and it drops down to the ground state by emitting a photon. If this

photon then travels through the material and meets another electron in the metastable excited

state this will cause the electron to drop down to the lower energy level and another photon to

be emitted. Now there are two photons of the same energy. If these photons then both move

through the material and each interacts with another electron in a metastable state, this will

result in them each causing an additional photon to be released. i.e. from 2 photons we then

get 4, and so on! This is how laser light is produced.

Figure 31.8: Spontaneous emission is a two step process, as shown here. First, energy from

an external source is applied to an atom in the laser medium, raising its energy to an excited

(metastable) state. After some time, it will decay back down to its ground state and emit the

excess energy in the form of a photon. This is the first stage in the formation of a laser beam.

Figure 31.9: Stimulated emission is also a two step process, as shown here. First, a laser photon

encounters an atom that has been raised to an excited state, just like in the case of spontaneous

emission. The photon then causes the atom to decay to its ground state and emit another

photon identical to the incoming photon. This is the second step in the creation of a laser beam.

It happens many, many times as the laser photons pass through the optical cavity until the laser

beam builds up to full strength.

This can only happen if there are many electrons in a metastable state. If most of the electrons

are in the ground state, then they will just absorb the photons and no extra photons will be

emitted. However, if more electrons are in the excited metastable state than in the ground

state, then the process of stimulated emission will be able to continue. Usually in atoms, most

of the electrons are in the lower energy levels and only a few are in excited states. When most

of the electrons are in the excited metastable state and only a few are in the ground state, this

is called population inversion (the populations are swapped around) and this is when

stimulated emission can occur. To start off the process, the electrons first have to be excited

up into the metastable state. This is done using an external energy source.

Definition: Population inversion

Population inversion is when more atoms are in an excited state than in their ground state.

It is a necessary condition to sustain a laser beam, so that there are enough excited atoms

that can be stimulated to emit more photons.

Therefore, materials used to make laser light must must have metastable states which can

allow population inversion to occur when an external energy source is applied. Some

substances which are used to make lasers are listed in table 31.3. You can see that gases (such

as Helium-Neon mixture), liquids (such as dyes), and solids (such as the precious stone ruby)

are all used to make lasers.
