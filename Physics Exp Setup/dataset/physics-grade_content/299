17.6.2 Real-world applications: capacitors

Capacitors are used in many different types of circuitry. In car speakers, capacitors are often

used to aid the power supply when the speaker require more power than the car battery can

provide. Capacitors are also used to in processing electronic signals in circuits, such as

smoothing voltage spikes due to inconsistent voltage sources. This is important for protecting

sensitive electronic compoments in a circuit.
