20.4.3 Unbiased

In a p-n junction, without an external applied voltage (no bias), an equilibrium condition is

reached in which a potential difference is formed across the junction.

P-type is where you have more "holes"; N-type is where you have more electrons in the

material. Initially, when you put them together to form a junction, holes near the junction

tends to "move" across to the N-region, while the electrons in the N-region drift across to the

p-region to "fill" some holes. This current will quickly stop as the potential barrier is built up

by the migrated charges. So in steady state no current flows.

Then now when you put a potential different across the terminals you have two cases: forward

biased and reverse biased.
