3.8 Worked Examples

The worked examples in this section demonstrate the types of questions that can be asked about

graphs.

Worked Example 8: Description of motion based on a position-time graph

Question: The position vs. time graph for the motion of a car is given below.

Draw the corresponding velocity vs. time and acceleration vs. time graphs, and then

describe the motion of the car.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for

The question gives a position vs. time graph and the following three things are

required:

1. Draw a v vs. t graph.

2. Draw an a vs. t graph.

3. Describe the motion of the car.

To answer these questions, break the motion up into three sections: 0 - 2 seconds,

2 - 4 seconds and 4 - 6 seconds.

Step 2 : Velocity vs. time graph for 0-2 seconds

For the first 2 seconds we can see that the displacement remains constant - so the

object is not moving, thus it has zero velocity during this time. We can reach this

conclusion by another path too: remember that the gradient of a displacement vs.

time graph is the velocity. For the first 2 seconds we can see that the displacement

vs. time graph is a horizontal line, ie. it has a gradient of zero. Thus the velocity

during this time is zero and the object is stationary.

Step 3 : Velocity vs. time graph for 2-4 seconds

For the next 2 seconds, displacement is increasing with time so the object is mov-

ing. Looking at the gradient of the displacement graph we can see that it is not

constant. In fact, the slope is getting steeper (the gradient is increasing) as time

goes on. Thus, remembering that the gradient of a displacement vs. time graph is

the velocity, the velocity must be increasing with time during this phase.

Step 4 : Velocity vs. time graph for 4-6 seconds

For the final 2 seconds we see that displacement is still increasing with time, but

this time the gradient is constant, so we know that the object is now travelling at

a constant velocity, thus the velocity vs. time graph will be a horizontal line during

this stage. We can now draw the graphs:

So our velocity vs. time graph looks like this one below. Because we haven't been

given any values on the vertical axis of the displacement vs. time graph, we cannot

figure out what the exact gradients are and therefore what the values of the velocities

are. In this type of question it is just important to show whether velocities are positive

or negative, increasing, decreasing or constant.

v (m·s−1)

t (s)

0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Once we have the velocity vs. time graph its much easier to get the acceleration vs.

time graph as we know that the gradient of a velocity vs. time graph is the just the

acceleration.

Step 5 : Acceleration vs. time graph for 0-2 seconds

For the first 2 seconds the velocity vs. time graph is horisontal and has a value of

zero, thus it has a gradient of zero and there is no acceleration during this time.

(This makes sense because we know from the displacement time graph that the ob-

ject is stationary during this time, so it can't be accelerating).

Step 6 : Acceleration vs. time graph for 2-4 seconds

For the next 2 seconds the velocity vs. time graph has a positive gradient. This

gradient is not changing (i.e. its constant) throughout these 2 seconds so there must

be a constant positive acceleration.

Step 7 : Acceleration vs. time graph for 4-6 seconds

For the final 2 seconds the object is traveling with a constant velocity. During this

time the gradient of the velocity vs. time graph is once again zero, and thus the

object is not accelerating. The acceleration vs. time graph looks like this:

a (m·s−2)

t (s)

0 2 4 6

Step 8 : A description of the object's motion

A brief description of the motion of the object could read something like this: At

t = 0 s and object is stationary at some position and remains stationary until t = 2 s

when it begins accelerating. It accelerates in a positive direction for 2 seconds until

t = 4 s and then travels at a constant velocity for a further 2 seconds.

Answer
Step 1 : Decide how to tackle the problem
We are asked to calculate the distance and displacement of the car. All we need to
remember here is that we can use the area between the velocity vs. time graph and
the time axis to determine the distance and displacement.
Step 2 : Determine the area under the velocity vs. time graph
Break the motion up: 0 - 5 seconds, 5 - 12 seconds, 12 - 14 seconds and 14 - 15
seconds.
For 0 - 5 seconds: The displacement is For 5 - 12 seconds: The displacement
equal to the area of the triangle on the is equal to the area of the rectangle:
left:

Area△ = b× h

For 12 - 14 seconds the displacement is For 14 - 15 seconds the displacement is
equal to the area of the triangle above equal to the area of the triangle below
the time axis on the right: the time axis:

Area△ = b× 1h Area△ = b× h

Step 3 : Determine the total distance of the car
Now the total distance of the car is the sum of all of these areas:
∆x = 10 + 28 + 4 + 1
= 43 m

3.8 CHAPTER 3. MOTION IN ONE DIMENSION - GRADE 10
Step 4 : Determine the total displacement of the car
Now the total displacement of the car is just the sum of all of these areas. HOW-
EVER, because in the last second (from t = 14 s to t = 15 s) the velocity of the
car is negative, it means that the car was going in the opposite direction, i.e. back
where it came from! So, to find the total displacement, we have to add the first 3
areas (those with positive displacements) and subtract the last one (because it is a
displacement in the opposite direction).
∆x = 10 + 28 + 4− 1
= 41 m in the positive direction

Answer
Step 1 : The velocity during the first 4 seconds
The velocity is given by the gradient of a position vs. time graph. During the first
4 seconds, this is

Step 2 : The velocity during the last 3 seconds
For the last 3 seconds we can see that the displacement stays constant. The graph
shows a horisontal line and therefore the gradient is zero. Thus v = 0 m · s−1.

Answer
Step 1 : Calculate the velocity values by using the area under each part of
the graph.
The motion of the car can be divided into three time sections: 0 - 2 seconds; 2 - 4
seconds and 4 - 6 seconds. To be able to draw the velocity vs. time graph, the
velocity for each time section needs to be calculated. The velocity is equal to the
area of the square under the graph:
For 0 - 2 seconds: For 2 - 4 seconds: For 4 - 6 seconds:
Area = ℓ× b Area = ℓ× b Area = ℓ× b

seconds and 4 - 6 seconds. To be able to draw the velocity vs. time graph, the

velocity for each time section needs to be calculated. The velocity is equal to the

area of the square under the graph:

For 0 - 2 seconds: For 2 - 4 seconds: For 4 - 6 seconds:

Area = ℓ× b Area = ℓ× b Area = ℓ× b

The velocity of the car is The velocity of the car is tive value, which means that

4 m·s−1 at t = 2s. 0 m·s−1from t = 2 s to the velocity is decreasing.

t = 4 s. It starts at a velocity of

4 m·s−1and decreases to

0 m·s−1.

Step 2 : Now use the values to draw the velocity vs. time graph.
