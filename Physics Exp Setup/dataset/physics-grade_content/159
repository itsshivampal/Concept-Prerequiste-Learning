10.5.1 Voltmeter

A voltmeter is an instrument for measuring the voltage between two points in an electric circuit.

In analogy with a water circuit, a voltmeter is like a meter designed to measure pressure difference.

Since one is interested in measuring the voltage between two points in a circuit, a voltmeter

must be connected in parallel with the portion of the circuit on which the measurement is made.

Figure 10.3: A voltmeter should be connected in parallel in a circuit.

Figure 10.3 shows a voltmeter connected in parallel with a battery. One lead of the voltmeter is

connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end. The

voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of

a circuit that has a voltage drop.
