7.4.3 Apparent Depth

Imagine a coin on the bottom of a shallow pool of water. If you reach for the coin, you will miss

it because the light rays from the coin are refracted at the water's surface.

Consider a light ray that travels from an underwater object to your eye. The ray is refracted at

the water surface and then reaches your eye. Your eye does not know Snell's Law; it assumes

light rays travel in straight lines. Your eye therefore sees the image of the at coin shallower

location. This shallower location is known as the apparent depth.

The refractive index of a medium can also be expressed as

real depth

n = .
