3.7 Summary of Graphs

The relation between graphs of position, velocity and acceleration as functions of time is sum-

marised in Figure 3.10.

Important: Often you will be required to describe the motion of an object that is presented

as a graph of either position, velocity or acceleration as functions of time. The description

of the motion represented by a graph should include the following (where possible):

1. whether the object is moving in the positive or negative direction

2. whether the object is at rest, moving at constant velocity or moving at constant

positive acceleration (speeding up) or constant negative acceleration (slowing down)

You will also often be required to draw graphs based on a description of the motion in words

or from a diagram. Remember that these are just different methods of presenting the same

information. If you keep in mind the general shapes of the graphs for the different types of

motion, there should not be any difficulty with explaining what is happening.
