14.5 Sound Waves

Sound waves coming from a tuning fork cause the tuning fork to vibrate and push against the

air particles in front of it. As the air particles are pushed together a compression is formed.

The particles behind the compression move further apart causing a rarefaction. As the particles

continue to push against each other, the sound wave travels through the air. Due to this

motion of the particles, there is a constant variation in the pressure in the air. Sound waves are

therefore pressure waves. This means that in media where the particles are closer together,

sound waves will travel quicker.

CHAPTER 14. LONGITUDINAL WAVES - GRADE 11 14.6

Sound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is

denser than air (the particles are closer together). Sound waves travel faster in solids than in

liquids.

Figure 14.8: Sound waves are pressure waves and need a medium through which to travel.

Important: A sound wave is different from a light wave.

• A sound wave is produced by an oscillating object while a light wave is not.

• A sound wave cannot be diffracted while a light wave can be diffracted.

Also, because a sound wave is a mechanical wave (i.e. that it needs a medium) it is not

capable of traveling through a vacuum, whereas a light wave can travel through a vacuum.

Important: A sound wave is a pressure wave. This means that regions of high pressure

(compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates.

These compressions and rarefactions arise because sound vibrates longitudinally and the

longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.

Sound will be studied in more detail in Chapter 15.

14.5 CHAPTER 14. LONGITUDINAL WAVES - GRADE 11

Important: A particle in the medium only moves back and forth when a longitudinal wave

moves through the medium.

As in Chapter 6, we can draw a graph of the particle's position as a function of time. For the

wave shown in Figure 14.4, we can draw the graph shown in Figure 14.5 for particle 0. The

graph for each of the other particles will be identical.

The graph of the particle's velocity as a function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of

the position vs. time graph. The graph of velocity vs. time for the position vs. time graph

shown in Figure 14.5 is shown is Figure 14.6.
