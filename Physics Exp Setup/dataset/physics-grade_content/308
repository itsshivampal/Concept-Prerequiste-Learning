18.4 Transformers

One of the real-world applications of Faraday's Law is in a transformer.

Eskom generates electricity at around 22 000 V. When you plug in a toaster, the mains voltage

is 220 V. A transformer is used to step-down the high voltage to the lower voltage that is used

as mains voltage.

Definition: Transformer

A transformer is an electrical device that uses the principle of induction between the primary

coil and the secondary coil to either step-up or step-down voltage.

The essential features of a transformer are two coils of wire, called the primary coil and the

secondary coil, which are wound around different sections of the same iron core.

iron core

primary coil secondary coil

magnetic flux

When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary coil it creates an alternating current in

that coil, which induces an alternating magnetic field in the iron core. This changing magnetic

field induces an emf, which creates a current in the secondary coil.

The circuit symbol for a transformer is:

A very useful property of transformers is the ability to transform voltage and current levels

according to a simple ratio, determined by the ratio of input and output coil turns. We can

derive a mathematical relationship by using Faraday's law.

Assume that an alternating voltage Vp is applied to the primary coil (which has Np turns) of a

transformer. The current that results from this voltage generates a magnetic flux φp. We can

then describe the emf in the primary coil by:

∆φp

Vp = Np

∆t

Similarly, for the secondary coil,

∆φs

Vs = Ns

∆t

If we assume that the primary and secondary windings are perfectly coupled, then:

φp = φs

which means that:

Vp Np

=

Vs Ns

Question: Calculate the voltage on the secondary coil if the voltage on the primary

coil is 120 V and the ratio of primary windings to secondary windings is 10:1.

A transformer designed to output more voltage than it takes in across the input coil is called a

step-up transformer. A step-up transformer has more windings on the secondary coil than on

the primary coil. This means that:

Ns > Np

Similarly, a transformer designed to output less than it takes in across the input coil is called a

step-down transformer. A step-down transformer has more windings on the primary coil than

on the primary coil. This means that:

Np > Ns

We use a step-up transformer to increase the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary

coil. It is used at power stations to increase the voltage for the transmission lines. A step-down

transformer decreases the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is particularly

used to decrease the voltage from the transmission lines to a voltage which can be used in

factories and in homes.

Transformer technology has made long-range electric power distribution practical. Without the

ability to efficiently step voltage up and down, it would be cost-prohibitive to construct power

systems for anything but close-range (within a few kilometres) use.

As useful as transformers are, they only work with AC, not DC. This is because the

phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on changing magnetic fields, and direct current (DC)

can only produce steady magnetic fields, transformers simply will not work with direct current.

Of course, direct current may be interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of a

transformer to create a changing magnetic field (as is done in automotive ignition systems to

produce high-voltage spark plug power from a low-voltage DC battery), but pulsed DC is not

that different from AC. Perhaps more than any other reason, this is why AC finds such

widespread application in power systems.
