3.6 Description of Motion

The purpose of this chapter is to describe motion, and now that we understand the definitions of

displacement, distance, velocity, speed and acceleration, we are ready to start using these ideas

to describe how an object is moving. There are many ways of describing motion:

1. words

2. diagrams

3. graphs

These methods will be described in this section.

We will consider three types of motion: when the object is not moving (stationary object), when

the object is moving at a constant velocity (uniform motion) and when the object is moving at

a constant acceleration (motion at constant acceleration).

Important: Acceleration does not tell us about the direction of the motion. Acceleration

only tells us how the velocity changes.

Important: Deceleration

Avoid the use of the word deceleration to refer to a negative acceleration. This word usually

means slowing down and it is possible for an object to slow down with both a positive and

negative acceleration, because the sign of the velocity of the object must also be taken into

account to determine whether the body is slowing down or not.

Exercise: Acceleration

1. An athlete is accelerating uniformly from an initial velocity of 0 m·s−1to a final

velocity of 4 m·s−1in 2 seconds. Calculate his acceleration. Let the direction

that the athlete is running in be the positive direction.

2. A bus accelerates uniformly from an initial velocity of 15 m·s−1to a final velocity

of 7 m·s−1in 4 seconds. Calculate the acceleration of the bus. Let the direction

of motion of the bus be the positive direction.

3. An aeroplane accelerates uniformly from an initial velocity of 200 m·s−1to a

velocity of 100 m·s−1in 10 seconds. It then accelerates uniformly to a final

velocity of 240 m·s−1in 20 seconds. Let the direction of motion of the aeroplane

be the positive direction.

(a) Calculate the acceleration of the aeroplane during the first 10 seconds of

the motion.

(b) Calculate the acceleration of the aeroplane during the next 14 seconds of

its motion.

(c) Calculate the acceleration of the aeroplane during the whole 24 seconds of

its motion.
