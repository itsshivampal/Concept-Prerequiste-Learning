Which of the following is true concerning the force of Wire A on Wire B?

Direction of Force Origin of Force

(a) towards A (attraction) electrostatic force between opposite charges

Two long straight parallel current-carrying conductors placed 1 m apart from each other

in a vacuum each carry a current of 1 A in the same direction.

B How does the force compare with that in the previous question when the current in

one of the conductors is halved, and their distance of separation is halved?

IEB 2005/11 HG An electron moving horizontally in a TV tube enters a region where there is a uniform

magnetic field. This causes the electron to move along the path (shown by the solid line)

because the magnetic field exerts a constant force on it. What is the direction of this

magnetic field?

Electric Circuits - Grade 11

19.1 Introduction

The study of electrical circuits is essential to understand the technology that uses electricity in

the real-world. This includes electricity being used for the operation of electronic devices like

computers.

19.2 Ohm's Law

19.2.1 Definition of Ohm's Law

Activity :: Experiment : Ohm's Law

Aim:

In this experiment we will look at the relationship between the current going

through a resistor and the potential difference (voltage) across the same resistor.

A

V

Method:

1. Set up the circuit according to the circuit diagram.

2. Draw the following table in your lab book.

Voltage, V (V) Current, I (A)

1,5

3,0

4,5

6,0

3. Get your teacher to check the circuit before turning the power on.

4. Measure the current.

5. Add one more 1,5 V battery to the circuit and measure the current again.
