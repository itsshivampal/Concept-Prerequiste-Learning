17.4.1 Electrical potential

The electric potential at a point is the electrical potential energy per unit charge, i.e. the

potential energy a positive test charge would have if it were placed at that point.

Consider a positive test charge +Q placed at A in the electric field of another positive point

charge.

A B

The test charge moves towards B under the influence of the electric field of the other charge.

In the process the test charge loses electrical potential energy and gains kinetic energy. Thus,

at A, the test charge has more potential energy than at B - A is said to have a higher

electrical potential than B.

The potential energy of a charge at a point in a field is defined as the work required to move

that charge from infinity to that point.

Definition: Potential difference

The potential difference between two points in an electric field is defined as the work

required to move a unit positive test charge from the point of lower potential to

that of higher potential.

If an amount of work W is required to move a charge Q from one point to another, then the

potential difference between the two points is given by,

W

V = unit : J.C−1 or V (the volt)

Q

From this equation we can define the volt.

Definition: The Volt

One volt is the potential difference between two points in an electric field if one joule of

work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from the one point to the other.

Worked Example 117: Potential difference

Question: What is the potential difference between two point in an electric field if

it takes 600J of energy to move a charge of 2C between these two points.

Answer

Step 5 : Determine what is required

We need to calculate the potential difference (V) between two points in an electric

field.

Step 6 : Determine what is given

We are given both the charges and the energy or work done to move the charge

between the two points.

Step 7 : Determine how to approach the problem
