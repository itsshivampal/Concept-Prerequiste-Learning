3.10 Applications in the Real-World

What we have learnt in this chapter can be directly applied to road safety. We can analyse the

relationship between speed and stopping distance. The following worked example illustrates this

application.

Worked Example 14: Stopping distance

Question: A truck is travelling at a constant velocity of 10 m·s−1when the driver

sees a child 50 m in front of him in the road. He hits the brakes to stop the truck.

The truck accelerates at a rate of -1.25 m·s−2. His reaction time to hit the brakes

is 0,5 seconds. Will the truck hit the child?

Answer

Step 1 : Analyse the problem and identify what information is given

It is useful to draw a timeline like this one:

v = 10 m·s−1

0,5 s

A B C

b b b

constant v negative acceleration

50 m

We need to know the following:

• What distance the driver covers before hitting the brakes.

• How long it takes the truck to stop after hitting the brakes.

• What total distance the truck covers to stop.

Step 2 : Calculate the distance AB

Before the driver hits the brakes, the truck is travelling at constant velocity. There

is no acceleration and therefore the equations of motion are not used. To find the

distance traveled, we use:

d

v =

t

d

10 =

0,5

d = 5 m

The truck covers 5 m before the driver hits the brakes.

Step 3 : Calculate the time BC

We have the following for the motion between B and C:

vi = 10m · s−1

vf = 0m · s−1

a = −1,25m · s−2

t = ?

We can use equation 3.1

vf = vi + at

0 = 10 + (−1,25)t

−10 = −1,25t

t = 8 s

Step 4 : Calculate the distance BC

For the distance we can use equation 3.2 or equation 3.3. We will use equation 3.2:

(vi + vf )

∆x = t

2

10 + 0

∆x = (8)

s

∆x = 40 m

Step 5 : Write the final answer

The total distance that the truck covers is dAB + dBC = 5 + 40 = 45 meters. The

child is 50 meters ahead. The truck will not hit the child.
