31.5 Lasers

A laser is a device that produces a special type of light: all the laser photons are identical!

They all have the same wavelength (and frequency), amplitude and phase. Since they all have

the same wavelength, this means they all have the same colour and the light is called

monochromatic. (Note: mono means "one" or "single" and chromatic means "colour".)

This is very different to most other light sources which produce light with a range of

wavelengths (e.g. white light from the sun consists of all the visible wavelengths.)

Laser light is highly directional and can be focused very well. This focus allows laser beams to

be used over long distances, and to pack a lot of energy into the beam while still requiring

reasonably small amounts of energy to be generated. Each centimetre of a typical laser beam

contains many billions of photons. These special properties of laser light come from the way in

which the laser photons are created and the energy levels of the material that makes up the

laser. These properties make laser light extremely useful in many applications from CD players

to eye surgery.

The term LASER stands for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation.

This stimulated emission is different to the spontaneous emission already discussed earlier.

Let's review the absorption and emission processes which can occur in atoms.

emission

E1 E1 E=E2-E1 to drop down to E1 by emitting

another photon of E=E2-1

• Absorption: As you can see in the picture above, absorption happens when an electron

jumps up to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon which has an energy equal to

the energy difference between the two energy levels.

• Spontaneous emission: Spontaneous emission is when an electron in a higher energy

level drops down to a lower energy level and a photon is emitted with an energy equal to

the energy difference between the two levels. There is no interference in this process

from outside factors. Usually spontaneous emission happens very quickly after an

electron gets into an excited state. In other words, the lifetime of the excited state is

very short. However, there are some excited states where an electron can remain in the

higher energy level for a longer time than usual before dropping down to a lower level.

These excited states are called metastable states.

• Stimulated emission: As the picture above shows, stimulated emission happens when

a photon with an energy equal to the energy difference between two levels interacts with

an electron in the higher level. This stimulates the electron to emit an identical photon

and drop down to the lower energy level. This process results in two photons at the end.

Definition: Spontaneous Emission

Spontaneous emission occurs when an atom is in an unstable excited state and randomly

decays to a less energetic state, emitting a photon to carry off the excess energy. The

unstable state decays in a characteristic time, called the lifetime.

Definition: Meta-stable state

A meta-stable state is an excited atomic state that has an unusually long lifetime, compared

to the lifetimes of other excited states of that atom. While most excited states have lifetimes

measured in microseconds and nanoseconds (10−6 s and 10−9 s), meta-stable states can

have lifetimes of milliseconds (10−3 s) or even seconds.

Definition: Stimulated emission

Stimulated emission occurs when a photon interacts with an excited atom, causing the atom

to decay and emit another identical photon.
