31.6 Summary

1. Light of the correct frequency can emit electrons from a metal. This is called the

photoelectric effect.

2. A metal has a work function which is the minimum energy needed to emit an electron

from the metal.

3. Emission spectra are formed by glowing gases. The pattern of the spectra is

characteristic of the specific gas.

4. Absorption spectra are formed when certain frequencies of light is absorbed by a material.

5. Lasers are devices that produce a special type of light that has many uses.

6. Lasers have many uses, including being used in CD and DVD players, to cut material, in

surgery, in printing, in telecommunications and as laser pointers.

Activity :: Case Study : Uses of lasers

Do research in a library or on the Internet on one application of laser

technology. Explain how the technology works by using a laser.

You will need to present your findings to the class in the form of a poster. You

can think of any useful application, but to give you some ideas of where to start,

some applications are listed below:

• laser printers

• laser communication and fibre optics

• optical storage

• using lasers as precision measurement tools

• your own ideas...

Exercise: Lasers

1. Explain what is meant by spontaneous emission of radiation.

2. Explain what is meant by stimulated emission of radiation.

3. List the similarities and differences between spontaneous emission of radiation

and stimulated emission of radiation.

4. How is the light emitted by a laser different from the light emitted by a light

bulb?

5. Describe using a simple diagram, how a laser works. Your description should

include the following concepts: metastable state and population inversion.

6. Give examples of some materials that have been used for lasers. What do all

these materials have in common?

7. Describe how the laser cavity affects:

• increasing amplification

• concentrating beam intensity

• narrowing the frequency of the beam

8. List some applications of lasers.
