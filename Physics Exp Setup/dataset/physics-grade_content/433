28.2.3 Real-life applications

Cars

A car contains an alternator that charges up its battery power the car's electric system when its

engine is running. Alternators have the great advantage over direct-current generators of not

using a commutator, which makes them simpler, lighter, less costly, and more rugged than a

DC generator.

Activity :: Research Topic : Alternators

Try to find out the different ampere values produced by alternators for different

types of machines. Compare these to understand what numbers make sense in the

real world. You will find different numbers for cars, trucks, buses, boats etc. Try to

find out what other machines might have alternators.

A car also contains a DC electric motor, the starter motor, to turn over the engine to start it.

A starter consists of the very powerful DC electric motor and starter solenoid that is attached

to the motor. A starter motor requires very high current to crank the engine, that's why it's

connected to the battery with large cables.

Electricity Generation

AC generators are mainly used in the real-world to generate electricity.
