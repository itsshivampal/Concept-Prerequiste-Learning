29.6.3 Storing binary numbers

Counting is important. However, it is equally important to be able to remember the numbers.

Computers can convert almost anything to a string of 0s and 1s, and therefore to a binary

number. Unless this number can be stored in the computer's memory, the computer would be

useless.

The memory in the computer contains many parts. Each part is able to store a single 0 or 1.

Since 0 and 1 are the two binary digits, we say that each part of the memory stores one bit.

Figure 29.20: A bistable circuit made from two NOR gates. This circuit is able to store one bit

of digital information. With the two inputs set to 0, you can see that the output could be (and

will remain) either 0 or 1. The circuit on the left shows an output of 0, the circuit on the right

shows an output of 1. Wires carrying high logic levels (1) are drawn thicker. The output of the

bistable is labelled Q.

Definition: Bit

One bit is a short way of saying one ‘binary digit'. It is a single 0 or 1.

Itneterreessttinigng If you have eight bits, you can store a binary number from 00000000 to

FFacctt 11111111 (0 to 255 in denary). This gives you enough permutations of 0s and

1s to have one for each letter of the alphabet (in upper and lower case), each

digit from 0 to 9, each punctuation mark and each control code used by a

computer in storing a document. When you type text into a word processor,

each character is stored as a set of eight bits. Each set of eight bits is called a

byte. Computer memories are graded according to how many bytes they store.

There are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte (kB), 1024× 1024 bytes in a megabyte

(MB), and 1024× 1024× 1024 bytes in a gigabyte (GB).

To store a bit we need a circuit which can ‘remember' a 0 or a 1. This is called a bistable

circuit because it has two stable states. It can stay indefinitely either as a 0 or a 1. An example

of a bistable circuit is shown in Figure 29.20. It is made from two NOR gates.

To store the 0 or the 1 in the bistable circuit, you set one of the inputs to 1, then put it back

to 0 again. If the input labelled ‘S' (set) is raised, the output will immediately become 1. This

is shown in Figure 29.21.

To store a 0, you raise the ‘R' (reset) input to 1. This is shown in Figure 29.22.

Once you have used the S or R inputs to set or reset the bistable circuit, you then bring both

inputs back to 0. The bistable ‘remembers' the state. Because of the ease with which the

circuit can be Reset and Set it is also called a RS flip flop circuit.

A computer memory will be able to store millions or billions of bits. If it used our circuit above,

it would need millions or billions of NOR gates, each of which is made from several transistors.

The computer memory is made of many millions of transistors.

Itneterreessttinigng The bistable circuits drawn here don't remember 0s or 1s for ever - they lose
FFacctt the information if the power is turned off. The same is true for the RAM
(Random Access Memory) used to store working and temporary data in a
computer. Some modern circuits contain special memory which can remember
its state even if the power is turned off. This is used in FLASH drives,
commonly found in USB data sticks and on the memory cards used with digital
cameras. These bistable circuits are much more complex.
You can also make T flip flops out of logic gates, however these are more complicated to design.

Electromagnetic Radiation

30.1 Introduction

This chapter will focus on the electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a

self-propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components

oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation, and are in phase

with each other. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of

the wave: these types include, in order of increasing frequency, radio waves, microwaves,

infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

30.2 Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation

If you watch a colony of ants walking up the wall, they look like a thin continuous black line.

But as you look closer, you see that the line is made up of thousands of separated black ants.

Light and all other types of electromagnetic radiation seems like a continuous wave at first, but

when one performs experiments on the light, one can notice that the light can have both wave

and particle like properties. Just like the individual ants, the light can also be made up of

individual bundles of energy, or quanta of light.

Light has both wave-like and particle-like properties (wave-particle duality), but only shows one

or the other, depending on the kind of experiment we perform. A wave-type experiment shows

the wave nature, and a particle-type experiment shows particle nature. One cannot test the

wave and the particle nature at the same time. A particle of light is called a photon.

Definition: Photon

A photon is a quantum (energy packet) of light.

The particle nature of light can be demonstrated by the interaction of photons with matter.

One way in which light interacts with matter is via the photoelectric effect, which will be

studied in detail in Chapter 31.

Exercise: Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation

1. Give examples of the behaviour of EM radiation which can best be explained

using a wave model.
