2.5.3 Scientific Notation

In Science one often needs to work with very large or very small numbers. These can be written

more easily in scientific notation, in the general form

d× 10e

where d is a decimal number between 0 and 10 that is rounded off to a few decimal places. e is

known as the exponent and is an integer. If e > 0 it represents how many times the decimal

place in d should be moved to the right. If e < 0, then it represents how many times the decimal

place in d should be moved to the left. For example 3,24 × 103 represents 3240 (the decimal

moved three places to the right) and 3,24× 10−3 represents 0,00324 (the decimal moved three

places to the left).

If a number must be converted into scientific notation, we need to work out how many times

the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it into a number between 1 and 10

(i.e. the value of e) and what this number between 1 and 10 is (the value of d). We do this by

counting the number of decimal places the decimal comma must move.

For example, write the speed of light in scientific notation, to two decimal places. The speed of

light is 299 792 458 m·s−1. First, find where the decimal comma must go for two decimal places

(to find d) and then count how many places there are after the decimal comma to determine e.

In this example, the decimal comma must go after the first 2, but since the number after the 9

is 7, d = 3,00. e = 8 because there are 8 digits left after the decimal comma. So the speed of

light in scientific notation, to two decimal places is 3,00 × 108 m·s−1.
