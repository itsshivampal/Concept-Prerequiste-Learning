28.3 Alternating Current

Most students of electricity begin their study with what is known as direct current (DC), which

is electricity flowing in a constant direction. DC is the kind of electricity made by a battery,

with definite positive and negative terminals).

However, we have seen that the electricity produced by a generator alternates and is therefore

known as alternating current(AC). The main advantage to AC is that the voltage can be

changed using transformers. That means that the voltage can be stepped up at power stations

to a very high voltage so that electrical energy can be transmitted along power lines at low

current and therefore experience low energy loss due to heating. The voltage can then be

stepped down for use in buildings and street lights.

Figure 28.9: Graph of current or voltage in an AC circuit.

In a DC circuit the current and voltage are constant. In an AC circuit the current and voltage

vary with time. The value of the current or voltage at any specific moment in time is called the

instantaneous current or voltage and is calculated as follows:

i = Imaxsin(2πft)

v = Vmaxsin(2πft)

i is the instantaneous current. Imax is the maximum current. v is the instantaneous voltage.

Vmax is the maximum voltage. f is the frequency of the AC and t is the time at which the

instantaneous current or voltage is being calculated.

This average value we use for AC is known as the root mean square (rms) average. This is

defined as:

Since AC varies sinusoidally, with as much positive as negative, doing a straight average would

get you zero for the average voltage. The rms value by-passes this problem.
