12.3.4 Newton's Third Law of Motion

Newton's Third Law of Motion deals with the interaction between pairs of objects. For example,

if you hold a book up against a wall you are exerting a force on the book (to keep it there) and

the book is exerting a force back at you (to keep you from falling through the book). This may

sound strange, but if the book was not pushing back at you, your hand will push through the

book! These two forces (the force of the hand on the book (F1) and the force of the book on

the hand (F2)) are called an action-reaction pair of forces. They have the same magnitude, but

act in opposite directions and act on different objects (the one force is onto the book and the

other is onto your hand).

There is another action-reaction pair of forces present in this situation. The book is pushing

against the wall (action force) and the wall is pushing back at the book (reaction). The force of

the book on the wall (F3) and the force of the wall on the book (F4) are shown in the diagram.

12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11

Definition: Newton's Third Law of Motion

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of equal magnitude on body

A, but in the opposite direction.

Newton's action-reaction pairs can be found everywhere in life where two objects interact with

one another. The following worked examples will illustrate this:

Worked Example 73: Newton III - seat belt

Question: Dineo is seated in the passenger seat of a car with the seat belt on. The

car suddenly stops and he moves forwards until the seat belt stops him. Draw a

labeled force diagram identifying two action-reaction pairs in this situation.

Answer

Step 1 : Draw a force diagram

Start by drawing the picture. You will be using arrows to indicate the forces so make

your picture large enough so that detailed labels can also be added. The picture

needs to be accurate, but not artistic! Use stickmen if you have to.

Step 2 : Label the diagram

Take one pair at a time and label them carefully. If there is not enough space on the

drawing, then use a key on the side.

F1: The force of Dineo on the seat belt

F2: The force of the seat belt on Dineo

F3: The force of Dineo on the seat (downwards)

F2 F1 F4: The force of the seat on Dineo (upwards)b

Worked Example 74: Newton III - forces in a lift

Question: Tammy travels from the ground floor to the fifth floor of a hotel in a

lift. Which ONE of the following statements is TRUE about the force exerted by

the floor of the lift on Tammy's feet?

A It is greater than the magnitude of Tammy's weight.

B It is equal in magnitude to the force Tammy's feet exert on the floor.

C It is equal to what it would be in a stationary lift.
D It is greater than what it would be in a stationary lift.
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the situation
This is a Newton's Third Law question and not Newton II. We need to focus on the
action-reaction pairs of forces and not the motion of the lift. The following diagram
will show the action-reaction pairs that are present when a person is standing on a
scale in a lift.
F4
F1: force of feet on lift (downwards)
F2: force of lift on feet (upwards)
F2 F3: force of Earth on person (downwards)
F4: force of person on Earth (upwards)
lift F3
F1
Figure 12.11: Newton's action-reaction pairs in a lift
In this question statements are made about the force of the floor (lift) on Tammy's
feet. This force corresponds to F2 in our diagram. The reaction force that pairs
up with this one is F1, which is the force that Tammy's feet exerts on the floor of
the lift. The magnitude of these two forces are the same, but they act in opposite
directions.
Step 2 : Choose the correct answer
It is important to analyse the question first, before looking at the answers as the
answers might confuse you. Make sure that you understand the situation and know
what is asked before you look at the options.
The correct answer is B.
Worked Example 75: Newton III - book and wall
Question: Tumi presses a book against a vertical wall as shown in the sketch.
1. Draw a labelled force diagram indicating all the forces acting on the book.
2. State, in words, Newton's Third Law of Motion.
3. Name the action-reaction pairs of forces acting in the horizontal plane.

12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11
A force diagram will look like this:
Upwards frictional force of wall on book
Applied force on girl on book Force of wall on book
Downwards gravitational force of Earth on book
Note that we had to draw all the force acting on the book and not the action-reaction
pairs. None of the forces drawn are action-reaction pairs, because they all act on the
same object (the book). When you label forces, be as specific as possible, including
the direction of the force and both objects involved, for example, do not say gravity
(which is an incomplete answer) but rather say 'Downward (direction) gravitational
force of the Earth (object) on the book (object)'.
Step 2 : State Newton's Third Law
If body A exerts a force onto body B, then body B will exert a force equal in mag-
nitude, but opposite in direction, onto body A.
Step 3 : Name the action-reaction pairs
The question only asks for action-reaction forces in the horizontal plane. Therefore:
Pair 1: Action: Applied force of the girl on the book; Reaction: The force of the
book on the girl.
Pair 2: Action: Force of the book on the wall; Reaction: Force of the wall on the
book.
Note that a Newton III pair will always involve the same combination of words, like
'book on wall' and wall on book'. The objects are 'swopped around' in naming the
pairs.

A force diagram will look like this:

Upwards frictional force of wall on book

Applied force on girl on book Force of wall on book

Downwards gravitational force of Earth on book

Note that we had to draw all the force acting on the book and not the action-reaction

pairs. None of the forces drawn are action-reaction pairs, because they all act on the

Step 2 : State Newton's Third Law

If body A exerts a force onto body B, then body B will exert a force equal in mag-

nitude, but opposite in direction, onto body A.

Step 3 : Name the action-reaction pairs

The question only asks for action-reaction forces in the horizontal plane. Therefore:

Pair 1: Action: Applied force of the girl on the book; Reaction: The force of the

book on the girl.

Pair 2: Action: Force of the book on the wall; Reaction: Force of the wall on the

book.

Note that a Newton III pair will always involve the same combination of words, like

'book on wall' and wall on book'. The objects are 'swopped around' in naming the

CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3

Method:

1. Divide into groups of at least five.

2. Attach one end of the fishing line to the blackboard with tape. Have one

teammate hold the other end of the fishing line so that it is taut and roughly

horizontal. The line must be held steady and must not be moved up or down

during the experiment.

3. Have one teammate blow up a balloon and hold it shut with his or her fingers.

Have another teammate tape the straw along the side of the balloon. Thread

the fishing line through the straw and hold the balloon at the far end of the

line.

4. Let go of the rocket and observe how the rocket moves forward.

5. Optionally, the rockets of each group can be timed to determine a winner of

the fastest rocket.

5.1 Assign one teammate to time the event. The balloon should be let go

when the time keeper yells "Go!" Observe how your rocket moves toward

the blackboard.

5.2 Have another teammate stand right next to the blackboard and yell "Stop!"

when the rocket hits its target. If the balloon does not make it all the way

to the blackboard, "Stop!" should be called when the balloon stops moving.

The timekeeper should record the flight time.

5.3 Measure the exact distance the rocket traveled. Calculate the average

speed at which the balloon traveled. To do this, divide the distance traveled

by the time the balloon was "in flight." Fill in your results for Trial 1 in

the Table below.

5.4 Each team should conduct two more races and complete the sections in

the Table for Trials 2 and 3. Then calculate the average speed for the

three trials to determine your team's race entry time.

Results:

Distance (m) Time (s) Speed (m·s−1)

Trial 1

Trial 2

Trial 3

Average:

Conclusions:

The winner of this race is the team with the fastest average balloon speed.

While doing the experiment, you should think about,

1. What made your rocket move?

2. How is Newton's Third Law of Motion demonstrated by this activity?

3. Draw pictures using labeled arrows to show the forces acting on the inside of

the balloon before it was released and after it was released.
