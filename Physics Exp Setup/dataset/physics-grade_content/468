30.6.1 Ultraviolet(UV) radiation and the skin

UVA and UVB are different ranges of frequencies for ultraviolet (UV) light. UVA and UVB can

damage collagen fibres which results in the speeding up skin aging. In general, UVA is the least

harmful, but it can contribute to the aging of skin, DNA damage and possibly skin cancer. It

penetrates deeply and does not cause sunburn. Because it does not cause reddening of the skin

(erythema) it cannot be measured in the SPF testing. There is no good clinical measurement

of the blocking of UVA radiation, but it is important that sunscreen block both UVA and UVB.

UVB light can cause skin cancer. The radiation excites DNA molecules in skin cells, resulting

in possible mutations, which can cause cancer. This cancer connection is one reason for

concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole.

As a defense against UV radiation, the body tans when exposed to moderate (depending on

skin type) levels of radiation by releasing the brown pigment melanin. This helps to block UV

penetration and prevent damage to the vulnerable skin tissues deeper down. Suntan lotion,

often referred to as sunblock or sunscreen, partly blocks UV and is widely available. Most of

these products contain an SPF rating that describes the amount of protection given. This

protection, however, applies only to UVB rays responsible for sunburn and not to UVA rays

that penetrate more deeply into the skin and may also be responsible for causing cancer and

wrinkles. Some sunscreen lotion now includes compounds such as titanium dioxide which helps

protect against UVA rays. Other UVA blocking compounds found in sunscreen include zinc

oxide and avobenzone.

Extension: What makes a good sunscreen?

• UVB protection: Padimate O, Homosalate, Octisalate (octyl salicylate),

Octinoxate (octyl methoxycinnamate)

• UVA protection: Avobenzone

• UVA/UVB protection: Octocrylene, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, Mexoryl

(ecamsule)

Another means to block UV is by wearing sun protective clothing. This is

clothing that has a UPF rating that describes the protection given against both

UVA and UVB.

30.6 Penetrating ability of electromagnetic radiation

Different kinds of electromagnetic radiation have different penetrabilities. For example, if we

take the human body as the object. Infrared light is emitted by the human body. Visible light

is reflected off the surface of the human body, ultra-violet light (from sunlight) damages the

skin, but X-rays are able to penetrate the skin and bone and allows for pictures of the inside of

the human body to be taken.

If we compare the energy of visible light to the energy of X-rays, we find that X-rays have a

much higher energy. Usually, kinds of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy have higher

penetrabilities than those with low energies.

Certain kinds of electromagnetic radiation such as ultra-violet radiation, X-rays and gamma

rays are very dangerous. Radiation such as these are called ionising radiation. Ionising radiation

loses energy as it passes through matter, breaking molecular bonds and creating ions.

Excessive exposure to radiation, including sunlight, X-rays and all nuclear radiations, can cause

destruction of biological tissue.
