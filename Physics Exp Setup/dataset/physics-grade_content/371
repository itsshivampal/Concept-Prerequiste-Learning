22.4.1 The properties of matter

The strength of a material is defined as the stress (the force per unit cross-sectional area) that

it can withstand. Strength is measured in newtons per square metre (N ·m−2).

Stiffness is a measure of how flexible a material is. In Science we measure the stiffness of a

material by calculating its Young's Modulus. The Young's modulus is a ratio of how much it

bends to the load applied to it. Stiffness is measure in newtons per metre (N ·m−1).

Hardness of a material can be measured by determining what force will cause a permanent

deformation in the material. Hardness can also be measured using a scale like Mohs hardness

scale. On this scale, diamond is the hardest at 10 and talc is the softest at 1.

Itneterreessttinigng Remembering that the Mohs scale is the hardness scale and that the softest

FFacctt substance is talc will often come in handy for general knowledge quizes.

The toughness of a material is a measure of how it can resist breaking when it is stressed. It is

scientifically defined as the amount of energy that a material can absorb before breaking.

A ductile material is a substance that can undergo large plastic deformation without fracturing.

Many metals are very ductile and they can be drawn into wires, e.g. copper, silver, aluminium

and gold.

A malleable material is a substance that can easily undergo plastic deformation by hammering

or rolling. Again, metals are malleable substances, e.g. copper can be hammered into sheets

and aluminium can be rolled into aluminium foil.

A brittle material fractures with very little or no plastic deformation. Glassware and ceramics

are brittle.
