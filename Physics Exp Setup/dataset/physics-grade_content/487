31.4.3 Colours and energies of electromagnetic radiation

We saw in the explanation of why the sky is blue that different wavelengths or frequencies of

light correspond to different colours of light. The table below gives the wavelengths and

colours for light in the visible spectrum:

Colour Wavelength range (nm)

violet 390 - 455

blue 455 - 492

green 492 - 577

yellow 577 - 597

orange 597 - 622

red 622 - 780

Table 31.2: Colours and wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum.

We also know that the energy of a photon of light can be found from:

hc

E = hf =

λ

Therefore if we know the frequency or wavelength of light, we can calculate the photon's

energy and vice versa.

Activity :: Investigation : Frequency,wavelength and energy relation

Refer to table 31.2: Copy the table into your workbook and add two additional

columns.

1. In the first new column write down the lower and upper frequencies for each

colour of light.

2. In the second column write down the energy range (in Joules) for each colour

of light.

Questions

1. Which colour of visible light has the highest energy photons?

2. Which colour of visible light has the lowest energy photons?

The wavelength given in the question is 500 nm. We can see in the table that green light has

wavelengths between 492 - 577 nm. Therefore 500 nm is in this range and the colour of the

light is green.

We also need to find which colour light photons have the highest energy and which

one has the lowest energy.

Step 2 : To find the colours of light, we can compare the wavelengths to

those given in table 31.2

1. 400 nm falls into the range for violet light (390 - 455 nm).

2. 580 nm falls into the range for yellow light (577 - 597 nm).

3. 650 nm falls into the range for red light (622 - 780 nm).

4. 300 nm is not shown in the table. However, this wavelength is just a little

shorter than the shortest wavelength in the violet range. Therefore 300 nm is

ultraviolet.

Step 3 : To find the colour of the light whose photons have the highest and

lowest energies respectively, we need to calculate the energies of all the

photons

We know E = hc

λ

For 400 nm:

hc

E =

λ

(6,63× 10−34)× (3× 108)

=

400× 10−9

= 4,97× 10−19 J

For 580 nm:

hc

E =

λ

(6,63× 10−34)× (3× 108)

=

580× 10−9

= 3,43× 10−19 J

For 650 nm:

hc

E =

λ

(6,63× 10−34)× (3× 108)

=

650× 10−9

= 3,06× 10−19 J

For 300 nm:

hc

E =

λ

(6,63× 10−34)× (3× 108)

=

300× 10−9

= 6,63× 10−19 J

Therefore, the photons with the highest energy are the ultraviolet photons.

The photons with the lowest energy are from light which is red.
