7.5.2 Plane Mirrors

Activity :: Investigation : Image formed by a mirror

1. Stand one step away from a large mirror

2. What do you observe in the mirror? This is called your image.

3. What size is your image? Bigger, smaller or the same size as you?

4. How far is your image from you? How far is your image from the mirror?

5. Is your image upright or upside down?

6. Take one step backwards. What does your image do? How far are you away

from your image?

7. Lift your left arm. Which arm does your image lift?

When you look into a mirror, you see an image of yourself.

The image created in the mirror has the following properties:

1. The image is virtual.

Figure 7.14: An image in a mirror is virtual, upright, the same size and laterally inverted.

2. The image is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.

3. The image is laterally inverted. This means that the image is inverted from side to side.

4. The image is the same size as the object.

5. The image is upright.

Virtual images are images formed in places where light does not really reach. Light does not

really pass through the mirror to create the image; it only appears to an observer as though the

light were coming from behind the mirror. Whenever a mirror creates an image which is virtual,

the image will always be located behind the mirror where light does not really pass.

Definition: Virtual Image

A virtual image is upright, on the opposite side of the mirror as the object, and light does

not actually reach it.

Figure 7.13: An object formed in a mirror is real and upright.

The object could be an actual source that emits light, such as a light bulb or a candle. More

commonly, the object reflects light from another source. When you look at your face in the

mirror, your face does not emit light. Instead, light from a light bulb or from the sun reflects off

your face and then hits the mirror. However, in working with light rays, it is easiest to pretend

the light is coming from the object.

An image formed by reflection may be real or virtual. A real image occurs when light rays

actually intersect at the image. A real image is inverted, or upside down. A virtual image occurs

when light rays do not actually meet at the image. Instead, you "see" the image because your

eye projects light rays backward. You are fooled into seeing an image! A virtual image is erect,

or right side up (upright).

You can tell the two types apart by putting a screen at the location of the image. A real image

can be formed on the screen because the light rays actually meet there. A virtual image cannot

be seen on a screen, since it is not really there.

To describe objects and images, we need to know their locations and their sizes. The distance

from the mirror to the object is the object distance, do.

The distance from the mirror to the image is the image distance, di.
