2.8 How to Change Units

It is very important that you are aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, you

must be able to convert between units. Being able to change between units (for example,

converting from millimetres to metres) is a useful skill in Science.

2.8 CHAPTER 2. UNITS

The following conversion diagrams will help you change from one unit to another.

×1000 ×1000

mm m km

÷1000 ÷1000

Figure 2.1: The distance conversion table

If you want to change millimetre to metre, you divide by 1000 (follow the arrow from mm to m);

or if you want to change kilometre to millimetre, you multiply by 1000×1000.

The same method can be used to change millilitre to litre or kilolitre. Use figure 2.2 to change

volumes:

×1000 ×1000

mℓ ℓ kℓ

cm3 dm3 m3

÷1000 ÷1000

Worked Example 3: Conversion 1

Question: Express 3 800 mm in metres.

Answer

Step 1 : Find the two units on the conversion diagram.

Use Figure 2.1 . Millimetre is on the left and metre in the middle.

Step 2 : Decide whether you are moving to the left or to the right.

You need to go from mm to m, so you are moving from left to right.

Step 3 : Read from the diagram what you must do and find the answer.

3 800 mm ÷ 1000 = 3,8 m

Worked Example 4: Conversion 2

Question: Convert 4,56 kg to g.

Answer

Step 1 : Find the two units on the conversion diagram.

Use Figure 2.1. Kilogram is the same as kilometre and gram the same as metre.

Step 2 : Decide whether you are moving to the left or to the right.

You need to go from kg to g, so it is from right to left.

Step 3 : Read from the diagram what you must do and find the answer.

4,56 kg × 1000 = 4560 g
