15.6.1 Echolocation

Animals like dolphins and bats make use of sounds waves to find their way. Just like ships on

the ocean, bats use sonar to navigate. Ultrasound waves that are sent out are reflected off the

objects around the animal. Bats, or dolphins, then use the reflected sounds to form a "picture"

of their surroundings. This is called echolocation.

Worked Example 104: SONAR

Question: A ship sends a signal to the bottom of the ocean to determine the

depth of the ocean. The speed of sound in sea water is 1450 m.s−1 If the signal is

received 1,5 seconds later, how deep is the ocean at that point?

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what is given and what is being asked:

s = 1450 m.s−1

t = 1,5 s there and back

∴ t = 0,75 s one way

d = ?

Step 2 : Calculate the distance:

368

CHAPTER 15. SOUND - GRADE 11 15.7

Distance = speed× time

d = s× t

= 1450× 0,75

= 1087,5 m

15.6 CHAPTER 15. SOUND - GRADE 11

Itneterreessttinigng In echo-sounding the reflections from ultrasound pulses that are bounced off

FFacctt objects (for example the bottom of the sea, fish etc.) are picked up. The

reflections are timed and since their speed is known, the distance to the object

can be found. This information can be built into a picture of the object that

reflects the ultrasound pulses.

seabed

Ships on the ocean make use of the reflecting properties of sound waves to determine the

depth of the ocean. A sound wave is transmitted and bounces off the seabed. Because the

speed of sound is known and the time lapse between sending and receiving the sound can be

measured, the distance from the ship to the bottom of the ocean can be determined, This is

called sonar, which stands from Sound Navigation And Ranging.
