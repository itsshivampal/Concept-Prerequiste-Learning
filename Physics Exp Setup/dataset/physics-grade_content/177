11.6.2 Subtracting Vectors

What does it mean to subtract a vector? Well this is really simple; if we have 5 apples and we

subtract 3 apples, we have only 2 apples left. Now lets work in steps; if we take 5 steps forward

and then subtract 3 steps forward we are left with only two steps forward:

5 steps 3 steps 2 steps

- =

What have we done? You originally took 5 steps forward but then you took 3 steps back. That

backward displacement would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with

length 3. The net result of adding these two vectors is 2 steps forward:

5 steps 3 steps 2 steps

+ =

Thus, subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite direction

(i.e. subtracting 3 steps forwards is the same as adding 3 steps backwards).

Important: Subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite

direction.

This suggests that in this problem to the right was chosen as the positive direction. Arrows to

the right are positive and arrows to the left are negative. More generally, vectors in opposite

directions differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as positive, then vectors acting down are negative).

Thus, changing the sign of a vector simply reverses its direction:

- = - =

- = - =

- = - =

In mathematical form, subtracting ~a from ~b gives a new vector ~c:

~c = ~b− ~a

= ~b+ (−~a)

This clearly shows that subtracting vector ~a from ~b is the same as adding (−~a) to ~b. Look at

the following examples of vector subtraction.

- = + = ~0

- = + =

+ = = ~0 + = = ~0

It is important to realise that the directions are not special- ‘forward and backwards' or ‘left and

right' are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel directions:

+ = = + = =

+ = = ~0 + = = ~0

In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one another. However the

same head-to-tail technique of vector addition can be applied to vectors in any direction.

+ = = + = = + = =

Now you have discovered one use for vectors; describing resultant displacement - how far and

in what direction you have travelled after a series of movements.

Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with displacements, all vectors behave in

exactly the same way. Thus, if given a number of forces acting on a body you can use the same

method to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to vector addition

in more detail later.
