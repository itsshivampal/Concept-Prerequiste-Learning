26.3 The Huygens Principle

Christiaan Huygens described how to determine the path of waves through a medium.

Definition: The Huygens Principle

Each point on a wavefront acts like a point source of circular waves. The waves emitted

from these point sources interfere to form another wavefront.

A simple example of the Huygens Principle is to consider the single wavefront in Figure 26.2.

Worked Example 169: Application of the Huygens Principle

Question: Given the wavefront,

use the Huygens Principle to determine the wavefront at a later time.

Answer

Step 1 : Draw circles at various points along the given wavefront

Figure 26.2: A single wavefront at time t acts as a series of point sources of circular waves that

interfere to give a new wavefront at a time t + ∆t. The process continues and applies to any

shape of waveform.

Step 2 : Join the crests of each circle to get the wavefront at a later time

Itneterreessttinigng Christiaan Huygens (14 April 1629 - 8 July 1695), was a Dutch mathematician,

FFacctt astronomer and physicist; born in The Hague as the son of Constantijn

Huygens. He studied law at the University of Leiden and the College of Orange

in Breda before turning to science. Historians commonly associate Huygens

with the scientific revolution.

Huygens generally receives minor credit for his role in the development of

modern calculus. He also achieved note for his arguments that light consisted of

waves; see: wave-particle duality. In 1655, he discovered Saturn's moon Titan.

He also examined Saturn's planetary rings, and in 1656 he discovered that those

rings consisted of rocks. In the same year he observed and sketched the Orion

Nebula. He also discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars.
