20.2.2 Insulator

The energy diagram for the insulator shows the insulator with a very wide energy gap. The

wider this gap, the greater the amount of energy required to move the electron from the

valence band to the conduction band. Therefore, an insulator requires a large amount of energy

to obtain a small amount of current. The insulator "insulates" because of the wide forbidden

band or energy gap.

Breakdown

A solid with filled bands is an insulator. If we raise the temperature the electrons gain thermal

energy. If there is enough energy added then electrons can be thermally excited from the

valence band to the conduction band. The fraction of electrons excited in this way depends on:

• the temperature and

• the band gap, the energy difference between the two bands.

Exciting these electrons into the conduction band leaves behind positively charged holes in the

valence band, which can also conduct electricity.

solid affect how the electrons of the atoms behave, by causing the individual energy levels of an

atom to break up and form energy bands. The resulting energy levels are more closely spaced

than those in the individual atoms. The energy bands still contain discrete energy levels, but

there are now many more energy levels than in the single atom.

In crystalline solids, atoms interact with their neighbors, and the energy levels of the electrons

in isolated atoms turn into bands. Whether a material conducts or not is determined by its

band structure.

Electrons follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that two electrons cannot occupy the

same state. Thus electrons in a solid fill up the energy bands up to a certain level (this is called

the Fermi energy). Bands which are completely full of electrons cannot conduct electricity,

because there is no state of nearby energy to which the electrons can jump. Materials in which

all bands are full are insulators.

20.2.1 Metals

Metals are good conductors because they have unfilled space in the valence energy band. In

the absence of an electric field, there are electrons traveling in all directions. When an electric

field is applied the mobile electrons flow. Electrons in this band can be accelerated by the

electric field because there are plenty of nearby unfilled states in the band.
