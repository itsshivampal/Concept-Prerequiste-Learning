10.3.2 Current

Now that we've thought about the moving charges and visualised what is happening we need

to get back to quantifying moving charge. I've already told you that we use current but we still

need to define it.

Definition: Current

Current is the rate at which charges moves past a fixed point in a circuit. We use the

symbol I to show current and it is measured in amperes (A). One ampere is one coulomb

of charge moving in one second.

∆t

When current flows in a circuit we show this on a diagram by adding arrows. The arrows show

the direction of flow in a circuit. By convention we say that charge flows from the positive

terminal on a battery to the negative terminal.

Vknown = 1V + 4V

Step 3 : Applicable principles

We know that the voltage across the battery must be equal to the total voltage

across all other circuit components.

Vbattery = Vtotal

The total voltage in the circuit is the sum of the voltages across the individual

resistors

Vtotal = Vparallel + Vknown

Using the relationship between the voltage across the battery and total voltage across

the resistors

Vbattery = Vtotal

Vbattery = Vparallel + Vknown

7V = V1 + 5V

Vparallel = 2V

10.3.1 Flow of Charge

We have been talking about moving charge. We need to be able to deal with numbers, how

much charge is moving, how fast is it moving? The concept that gives us this information is

called current. Current allows us to quantify the movement of charge.

When we talk about current we talk about how much charge moves past a fixed point in circuit

in one second. Think of charges being pushed around the circuit by the battery, there are charges

in the wires but unless there is a battery they won't move. When one charge moves the charges

next to it also move. They keep their spacing. If you had a tube of marbles like in this picture.

marble marble

If you push one marble into the tube one must come out the other side. If you look at any point

in the tube and push one marble into the tube, one marble will move past the point you are

looking at. This is similar to charges in the wires of a circuit.

If a charge moves they all move and the same number move at every point in the circuit.
