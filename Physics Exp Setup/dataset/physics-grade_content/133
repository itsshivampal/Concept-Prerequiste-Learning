The closer together the charges are, the stronger the electrostatic force between them.
F F
+ + stronger repulsive force
(shorter distance between charges)
F F weaker repulsive force
+ + (longer distance between charges)
Activity :: Experiment : Electrostatic Force
You can easily test that like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other
by doing a very simple experiment.
Take a glass rod and rub it with a piece of silk, then hang it from its middle
with a piece string so that it is free to move. If you then bring another glass rod
which you have also charged in the same way next to it, you will see the rod on the
string turn away from the rod in your hand i.e. it is repelled. If, however, you take
a plastic rod, rub it with a piece of fur and then bring it close to the rod on the
string, you will see the rod on the string turn towards the rod in your hand i.e. it is
attracted.

This happens because when you rub the glass with silk, tiny amounts of negative
charge are transferred from the glass onto the silk, which causes the glass to have
less negative charge than positive charge, making it positively charged. When you
rub the plastic rod with the fur, you transfer tiny amounts of negative charge onto
the rod and so it has more negative charge than positive charge on it, making it
negatively charged.

Worked Example 41: Application of electrostatic forces
Question: Two charged metal spheres hang from strings and are free to move as
shown in the picture below. The right hand sphere is positively charged. The charge
on the left hand sphere is unknown.
? +
The left sphere is now brought close to the right sphere.
1. If the left hand sphere swings towards the right hand sphere, what can you say
about the charge on the left sphere and why?
2. If the left hand sphere swings away from the right hand sphere, what can you
say about the charge on the left sphere and why?
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what is known and what question you need to answer:
In the first case, we have a sphere with positive charge which is attracting the left
charged sphere. We need to find the charge on the left sphere.
Step 2 : What concept is being used?
We are dealing with electrostatic forces between charged objects. Therefore, we
know that like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract each other.
Step 3 : Use the concept to find the solution
1. In the first case, the positively charged sphere is attracting the left sphere.
Since an electrostatic force between unlike charges is attractive, the left sphere
must be negatively charged.
2. In the second case, the positively charged sphere repels the left sphere. Like
charges repel each other. Therefore, the left sphere must now also be positively
charged.
Extension: Electrostatic Force
The electrostatic force determines the arrangement of charge on the surface of con-
ductors. When we place a charge on a spherical conductor the repulsive forces
between the individual like charges cause them to spread uniformly over the sur-
face of the sphere. However, for conductors with non-regular shapes, there is a
concentration of charge near the point or points of the object.

This collection of charge can actually allow charge to leak off the conductor if the
point is sharp enough. It is for this reason that buildings often have a lightning rod
on the roof to remove any charge the building has collected. This minimises the
possibility of the building being struck by lightning. This "spreading out" of charge
would not occur if we were to place the charge on an insulator since charge cannot
move in insulators.

Itneterreessttinigng The word â€˜electron' comes from the Greek word for amber. The ancient Greeks

FFacctt observed that if you rubbed a piece of amber, you could use it to pick up bits of

straw.
