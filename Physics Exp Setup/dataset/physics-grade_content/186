11.8.4 End of chapter exercises: Vectors - Long questions

1. A helicopter flies due east with an air speed of 150 km.h−1. It flies through an air current

which moves at 200 km.h−1 north. Given this information, answer the following questions:

1.1 In which direction does the helicopter fly?

1.2 What is the ground speed of the helicopter?

1.3 Calculate the ground distance covered in 40 minutes by the helicopter.

2. A plane must fly 70 km due north. A cross wind is blowing to the west at 30 km.h−1. In

which direction must the pilot steer if the plane goes at 200 km.h−1 in windless conditions?

3. A stream that is 280 m wide flows along its banks with a velocity of 1.80m.s−1. A raft

can travel at a speed of 2.50 m.s−1 across the stream. Answer the following questions:

3.1 What is the shortest time in which the raft can cross the stream?

3.2 How far does the raft drift downstream in that time?

3.3 In what direction must the raft be steered against the current so that it crosses the

stream perpendicular to its banks?

3.4 How long does it take to cross the stream in question 3?

4. A helicopter is flying from place X to place Y . Y is 1000 km away in a direction 50◦ east of

north and the pilot wishes to reach it in two hours. There is a wind of speed 150 km.h−1

blowing from the northwest. Find, by accurate construction and measurement (with a

scale of 1 cm = 50 km.h−1), the

4.1 the direction in which the helicopter must fly, and

4.2 the magnitude of the velocity required for it to reach its destination on time.

5. An aeroplane is flying towards a destination 300 km due south from its present position.

There is a wind blowing from the north east at 120 km.h−1. The aeroplane needs to reach

its destination in 30 minutes. Find, by accurate construction and measurement (with a

scale of 1 cm = 30 km.s−1), or otherwise, the

5.1 the direction in which the aeroplane must fly and

5.2 the speed which the aeroplane must maintain in order to reach the destination on

time.

5.3 Confirm your answers in the previous 2 subquestions with calculations.

6. An object of weight W is supported by two ca- 45

◦

bles attached to the ceiling and wall as shown.

The tensions in the two cables are T1 and T2 T1

respectively. Tension T1 = 1200 N. Determine the 70◦

tension T2 and weight W of the object by accu-

T2

rate construction and measurement or by calculation.

11.8 CHAPTER 11. VECTORS

7. In a map-work exercise, hikers are required to walk from a tree marked A on the map to

another tree marked B which lies 2,0 km due East of A. The hikers then walk in a straight

line to a waterfall in position C which has components measured from B of 1,0 km E and

4,0 km N.

7.1 Distinguish between quantities that are described as being vector and scalar.

7.2 Draw a labelled displacement-vector diagram (not necessarily to scale) of the hikers'

complete journey.

7.3 What is the total distance walked by the hikers from their starting point at A to the

waterfall C?

7.4 What are the magnitude and bearing, to the nearest degree, of the displacement of

the hikers from their starting point to the waterfall?

8. An object X is supported by two strings, A and B,

attached to the ceiling as shown in the sketch. Each of

these strings can withstand a maximum force of 700 N. 30

The weight of X is increased gradually. B

A

8.1 Draw a rough sketch of the triangle of forces, and

use it to explain which string will break first.

X

8.2 Determine the maximum weight of X which can

be supported.

9. A rope is tied at two points which are 70 cm apart from each other, on the same horizontal

line. The total length of rope is 1 m, and the maximum tension it can withstand in any

part is 1000 N. Find the largest mass (m), in kg, that can be carried at the midpoint of

the rope, without breaking the rope. Include a vector diagram in your answer.

Chapter 12

Force, Momentum and Impulse -

Grade 11

12.1 Introduction

In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion. In this chapter we will learn

that a net force is needed to cause motion. We recall what a force is and learn about how force

and motion are related. We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse, and

we learn more about turning forces and the force of gravity.
