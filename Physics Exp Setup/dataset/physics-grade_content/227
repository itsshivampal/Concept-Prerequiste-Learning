12.7 Summary

Newton's First Law Every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line

unless it is made to change its state by the action of an unbalanced force.

Newton's Second Law The resultant force acting on a body will cause the body to accelerate

in the direction of the resultant force The acceleration of the body is directly proportional

to the magnitude of the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

Newton's Third Law If body A exerts a force on body B then body B will exert an equal but

opposite force on body A.

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation Every body in the universe exerts a force on every

other body. The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the bodies

and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Equilibrium Objects at rest or moving with constant velocity are in equilibrium and have a zero

resultant force.

Equilibrant The equilibrant of any number of forces is the single force required to produce

equilibrium.

Triangle Law for Forces in Equilibrium Three forces in equilibrium can be represented in mag-

nitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.

Momentum The momentum of an object is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity.

Momentum of a System The total momentum of a system is the sum of the momenta of each

of the objects in the system.

Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum: ‘The total linear momentum of an isolated

system is constant' or ‘In an isolated system the total momentum before a collision (or

explosion) is equal to the total momentum after the collision (or explosion)'.

Law of Momentum: The applied resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of

change of the object's momentum and this force is in the direction of the change in

momentum.

3.1 Calculate the mechanical advantage of the lever that he is using.

3.2 What type of lever is he using? Give a reason for your answer.

3.3 If the force is applied 1 m from the pivot, calculate the distance between the pivot

and the load.

4. A crowbar is used to lift a box of weight 400 N. The box is placed 75 cm from the pivot.

A crow bar is a class 1 lever.

4.1 Why is a crowbar a class 1 lever. Draw a diagram to explain your answer.

4.2 What force F needs to be applied at a distance of 1,25 m from the pivot to balance

the crowbar?

4.3 If force F was applied at a distance of 2 m, what would the magnitude of F be?

5. A wheelbarrow is used to carry a load of 200 N. The load is 40 cm from the pivot and the

force F is applied at a distance of 1,2 m from the pivot.

5.1 What type of lever is a wheelbarrow?

5.2 Calculate the force F that needs to be applied to lift the load.

6. The bolts holding a car wheel in place is tightened to a torque of 90 N · m. The mechanic

has two spanners to undo the bolts, one with a length of 20 cm and one with a length of 30

cm. Which spanner should he use? Give a reason for your answer by showing calculations

and explaining them.
