14.6 Seismic Waves

Seismic waves are waves from vibrations in the Earth (core, mantle, oceans). Seismic waves

also occur on other planets, for example the moon and can be natural (due to earthquakes,

volcanic eruptions or meteor strikes) or man-made (due to explosions or anything that hits the

earth hard). Seismic P-waves (P for pressure) are longitudinal waves which can travel through

solid and liquid.
