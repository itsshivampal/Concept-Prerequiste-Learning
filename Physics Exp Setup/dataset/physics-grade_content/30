3.5 Acceleration

Definition: Acceleration

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

Acceleration (symbol a) is the rate of change of velocity. It is a measure of how fast the velocity

of an object changes in time. If we have a change in velocity (∆v) over a time interval (∆t),

then the acceleration (a) is defined as:

change in velocity (in m · s−1)

acceleration (in m · s−2) =

change in time (in s)

∆v

a =

∆t

Since velocity is a vector, acceleration is also a vector. Acceleration does not provide any infor-

mation about a motion, but only about how the motion changes. It is not possible to tell how

fast an object is moving or in which direction from the acceleration.

Like velocity, acceleration can be negative or positive. We see that when the sign of the acceler-

ation and the velocity are the same, the object is speeding up. If both velocity and acceleration

are positive, the object is speeding up in a positive direction. If both velocity and acceleration

are negative, the object is speeding up in a negative direction. If velocity is positive and accel-

eration is negative, then the object is slowing down. Similarly, if the velocity is negative and the

acceleration is positive the object is slowing down. This is illustrated in the following worked

example.

Worked Example 7: Acceleration

Question: A car accelerates uniformly from and initial velocity of 2 m·s−1 to a final

velocity of 10 m·s1 in 8 seconds. It then slows down uniformly to a final velocity of 4

m·s−1 in 6 seconds. Calculate the acceleration of the car during the first 8 seconds

and during the last 6 seconds.

Answer

Step 9 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for:

Consider the motion of the car in two parts: the first 8 seconds and the last 6 seconds.

For the first 8 seconds: For the last 6 seconds:

vi = 2 m · s−1 vi = 10 m · s−1

vf = 10 m · s−1 vf = 4 m · s−1

ti = 0 s ti = 8 s

tf = 8 s tf = 14 s

Step 10 : Calculate the acceleration.

For the first 8 seconds: For the next 6 seconds:

a = a =

∆t ∆t

10− 2 4− 10

= =

8− 0 14− 8

= 1 m · s−2 = −1 m · s−2

During the first 8 seconds the car had a positive acceleration. This means that its

velocity increased. The velocity is positive so the car is speeding up. During the

next 6 seconds the car had a negative acceleration. This means that its velocity

decreased. The velocity is positive so the car is slowing down.

Important: Acceleration does not tell us about the direction of the motion. Acceleration

only tells us how the velocity changes.

Important: Deceleration

Avoid the use of the word deceleration to refer to a negative acceleration. This word usually

means slowing down and it is possible for an object to slow down with both a positive and

negative acceleration, because the sign of the velocity of the object must also be taken into

account to determine whether the body is slowing down or not.

1. An athlete is accelerating uniformly from an initial velocity of 0 m·s−1to a final

velocity of 4 m·s−1in 2 seconds. Calculate his acceleration. Let the direction

that the athlete is running in be the positive direction.

2. A bus accelerates uniformly from an initial velocity of 15 m·s−1to a final velocity

of 7 m·s−1in 4 seconds. Calculate the acceleration of the bus. Let the direction

of motion of the bus be the positive direction.

3. An aeroplane accelerates uniformly from an initial velocity of 200 m·s−1to a

velocity of 100 m·s−1in 10 seconds. It then accelerates uniformly to a final

velocity of 240 m·s−1in 20 seconds. Let the direction of motion of the aeroplane

be the positive direction.

the motion.

(b) Calculate the acceleration of the aeroplane during the next 14 seconds of

its motion.

(c) Calculate the acceleration of the aeroplane during the whole 24 seconds of

its motion.

During the first 8 seconds the car had a positive acceleration. This means that its

next 6 seconds the car had a negative acceleration. This means that its velocity

decreased. The velocity is positive so the car is slowing down.
