29.6.2 Counting circuits

To make a counter you need several ‘T flip flops', sometimes called ‘divide by two' circuits. A

T flip flop is a digital circuit which swaps its output (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) whenever the

input changes from 1 to 0. When the input changes from 0 to 1 it doesn't change its output.

It is called a flip flop because it changes (flips or flops) each time it receives a pulse.

If you put a series of pulses 10101010 into a T flip flop, the result is 01100110. Figure 29.18

makes this clearer.

As you can see from Figure 29.18, there are half as many pulses in the output. This is why it is

called a ‘divide by two' circuit.

If we connect T flip flops in a chain, then we make a counter which can count pulses. As an

example, we connect three T flip flops in a chain. This is shown in Figure 29.19.

When this circuit is fed with a stream of pulses, the outputs of the different stages change.

The table below shows how this happens. Each row shows a different stage, with the first stage

at the top. We assume that all of the flip flops have 0 as their output to start with.

of each flip flop is labelled T, while each output is labelled Q. The pulses are connected to the

input on the left. The outputs Q0, Q1 and Q2 give the three digits of the binary number as the

pulses are counted. This is explained in the text and in the next table.

The binary numbers in the right hand column count the pulses arriving at the input. You will

notice that the output of the first flip flop gives the right most digit of the pulse count (in

binary). The output of the second flip flop gives the second digit from the right (the ‘twos'

digit) of the pulse count. The output of the third flip flop gives the third digit from the right

(the ‘fours' digit) of the pulse count. As there are only three flip flops, there is nothing to

provide the next digit (the ‘eights' digit), and so the eighth pulse is recorded as 000, not 1000.

This device is called a modulo 8 counter because it can count in eight stages from 000 to 111

before it goes back to 000. If you put four flip flops in the counter, it will count in sixteen

stages from 0000 to 1111, and it is called a modulo 16 counter because it counts in sixteen

stages before going back to 0000.

Definition: Modulo

The modulo of a counter tells you how many stages (or pulses) it receives before going back

to 0 as its output. Thus a modulo 8 counter counts in eight stages 000, 001, 010, 011,

100, 101, 110, 111, then returns to 000 again.

FFacctt from 0 to 2n − 1.
