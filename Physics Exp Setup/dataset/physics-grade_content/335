20.3.1 Surplus

A surplus of electrons is created by adding an element that has more valence electrons than Si

to the Si crystal. This is known as n-type doping and elements used for n-type doping usually

come from Group V in the periodic table. Elements from Group V have 5 valence electrons,

one more than the Group IV elements.

A common n-type dopant (substance used for doping) is arsenic (As). The combination of a

semiconductor and an n-type dopant is known as an n-type semiconductor. A Si crystal doped

with As is shown in Figure 20.2. When As is added to a Si crystal, the 4 of the 5 valence

electrons in As bond with the 4 Si valence electrons. The fifth As valence electron is free to

move around.

It takes only a few As atoms to create enough free electrons to allow an electric current to flow

through the silicon. Since n-type dopants â€˜donate' their free atoms to the semiconductor, they

are known as donor atoms.

Figure 20.2: Si crystal doped with As. For each As atom present in the Si crystal, there is one

extra electron. This combination of Si and As is known as an n-type semiconductor, because of

its overall surplus of electrons.
