Worked Example 123: Charged particle moving in a magnetic field

Question: An electron travels at 150m.s−1 at right angles to a magnetic field of

80 000 T. What force is exerted on the electron?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to determine the force on a moving charge in a magnetic field

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We can use the formula:

F = qvB

Step 3 : Determine what is given

We are given

• q = 1,6× 10−19C (The charge on an electron)

• v = 150m.s−1

• B = 80 000T

Step 4 : Determine the force

F = qvB

= (1,6× 10−19C)(150m.s−1)(80 000T)

= 1,92× 10−12N

Important: The direction of the force exerted on a charged particle moving through a

magnetic field is determined by using the Right Hand Rule.

Point your fingers in the direction of the velocity of the charge and turn them (as if turning

a screwdriver) towards the direction of the magnetic field. Your thumb will point in the

direction of the force. If the charge is negative, the direction of the force will be opposite

to the direction of your thumb.
