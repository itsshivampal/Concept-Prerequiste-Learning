12.5.6 Impulse

Impulse is the product of the net force and the time interval for which the force acts. Impulse is

defined as:

Impulse = F ·∆t (12.8)

However, from Newton's Second Law, we know that

∆p

F =

∆t

∴ F ·∆t = ∆p

= Impulse

Therefore,

Impulse = ∆p

Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. From this equation we see, that

for a given change in momentum, Fnet∆t is fixed. Thus, if Fnet is reduced, ∆t must be in-

creased (i.e. a smaller resultant force must be applied for longer to bring about the same change

in momentum). Alternatively if ∆t is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for a shorter

period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum.

Worked Example 90: Impulse and Change in momentum

Question: A 150 N resultant force acts on a 300 kg trailer. Calculate how long it

takes this force to change the trailer's velocity from 2 m·s−1to 6 m·s−1in the same

direction. Assume that the forces acts to the right.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for

The question explicitly gives

• the trailer's mass as 300 kg,

• the trailer's initial velocity as 2 m·s−1to the right,

• the trailer's final velocity as 6 m·s−1to the right, and

• the resultant force acting on the object

all in the correct units!

We are asked to calculate the time taken ∆t to accelerate the trailer from the 2 to

6 m·s−1. From the Law of Momentum,

Fnet∆t = ∆p

= mvf −mvi

= m(vf − vi).

Thus we have everything we need to find ∆t!

Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference

Choose right as the positive direction.

Step 3 : Do the calculation and quote the final answer

Fnet∆t = m(vf − vi)

(+150)∆t = (300)((+6)− (+2))

(+150)∆t = (300)(+4)

(300)(+4)

∆t =

+150

∆t = 8 s

It takes 8 s for the force to change the object's velocity from 2 m·s−1to the right to

6 m·s−1to the right.

Worked Example 91: Impulsive cricketers!

Question: A cricket ball weighing 156 g is moving at 54 km·hr−1towards a batsman.

It is hit by the batsman back towards the bowler at 36 km·hr−1. Calculate

1. the ball's impulse, and

2. the average force exerted by the bat if the ball is in contact with the bat for

0,13 s.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for

The question explicitly gives

• the ball's mass,

• the ball's initial velocity,

• the ball's final velocity, and

• the time of contact between bat and ball

We are asked to calculate the impulse

Impulse = ∆p = Fnet∆t

Since we do not have the force exerted by the bat on the ball (Fnet), we have to

calculate the impulse from the change in momentum of the ball. Now, since

∆p = pf − pi

= mvf −mvi,

we need the ball's mass, initial velocity and final velocity, which we are given.

Step 2 : Convert to S.I. units

Firstly let us change units for the mass

1000 g = 1 kg

1

So, 1 g = kg

1000

1

∴ 156× 1 g = 156× kg

1000

= 0,156 kg

Next we change units for the velocity

1 km · h−1 1000m=

3 600 s

∴ 54× 1 km · h−1 = 54× 1 000m

3 600 s

= 15m · s−1

Similarly, 36 km·hr−1= 10 m·s−1.

Step 3 : Choose a frame of reference

Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction.

Then the initial velocity of the ball is vi = -15 m·s−1, while the final velocity of the

ball is vf = 10 m·s−1.

Step 4 : Calculate the momentum

12.5 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11

Now we calculate the change in momentum,

p = pf − pi

= mvf −mvi

= m(vf − vi)

= (0,156)((+10)− (−15))

= +3,9

= 3,9 kg · m · s−1in the direction from batsman to bowler

Step 5 : Determine the impulse

Finally since impulse is just the change in momentum of the ball,

Impulse = ∆p

= 3,9 kg · m · s−1in the direction from batsman to bowler

Step 6 : Determine the average force exerted by the bat

Impulse = Fnet∆t = ∆p

We are given ∆t and we have calculated the impulse of the ball.

Fnet∆t = Impulse

Fnet(0,13) = +3,9

+3,9

Fnet =

0,13

= +30

= 30N in the direction from batsman to bowler
