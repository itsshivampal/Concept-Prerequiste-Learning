13.6 Microscopes

We have seen how lenses and mirrors are combined to magnify objects that are far away in a

telescope. Lenses can also be used to make very small objects bigger.

Figure 13.10 shows that when an object is placed at a distance less than f from the lens, the

image formed is virtual, upright and is larger than the object. This set-up is a simple magnifier.

If you want to look at something very small, two lenses may work better than one. Microscopes

and telescopes often use two lenses to make an image large enough to see.

A compound microscope uses two lenses to achieve high magnification (Figure 13.22). Both

lenses are convex, or converging. Light from the object first passes through the objective lens.

The lens that you look through is called the eyepiece. The focus of the system can be

adjusted by changing the length of the tube between the lenses.

Drawing a Ray Diagram for a Two-Lens System

You already have all the tools to analyze a two-lens system. Just consider one lens at a time.

1. Use ray tracing or the lens equation to find the image for the first lens.

2. Use the image of the first lens as the object of the second lens.

3. To find the magnification, multiply: mtotal = m1 ×m2 ×m3 × ...

Worked Example 101: The Compound Microscope

Question: A compound microscope consists of two convex lenses. The eyepiece

has a focal length of 10 cm. The objective lens has a focal length of 6 cm. The two

lenses are 30 cm apart. A 2 cm-tall object is placed 8 cm from the objective lens.

1. Where is the final image?

2. Is the final image real or virtual?

Answer

We can use ray tracing to follow light rays through the microscope, one lens at a

time.

Step 1 : Set up the system

To prepare to trace the light rays, make a diagram. In the diagram here, we place

the image on the left side of the microscope. Since the light will pass through the

objective lens first, we'll call this Lens 1. The eyepiece will be called Lens 2. Be

sure to include the focal points of both lenses in your diagram.
