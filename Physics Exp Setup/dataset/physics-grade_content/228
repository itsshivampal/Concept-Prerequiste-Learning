Geometrical Optics - Grade 11

13.1 Introduction

In Grade 10, we studied how light is reflected and refracted. This chapter builds on what you

have learnt in Grade 10. You will learn about lenses, how the human eye works as well as how

telescopes and microscopes work.

13.2 Lenses

In this section we will discuss properties of thin lenses. In Grade 10, you learnt about two kinds

of mirrors: concave mirrors which were also known as converging mirrors and convex mirrors

which were also known as diverging mirrors. Similarly, there are two types of lenses: converging

and diverging lenses.

We have learnt how light travels in different materials, and we are now ready to learn how we

can control the direction of light rays. We use lenses to control the direction of light. When

light enters a lens, the light rays bend or change direction as shown in Figure 13.1.

Definition: Lens

A lens is any transparent material (e.g. glass) of an appropriate shape that can take parallel

rays of incident light and either converge the rays to a point or diverge the rays from a

point.

Some lenses will focus light rays to a single point. These lenses are called converging or concave

lenses. Other lenses spread out the light rays so that it looks like they all come from the same

point. These lenses are called diverging or convex lenses. Lenses change the direction of light

rays by refraction. They are designed so that the image appears in a certain place or as a certain

size. Lenses are used in eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. You also have lenses

in your eyes!

Definition: Converging Lenses

Converging lenses converge parallel rays of light and are thicker in the middle than at the

edges.

Definition: Diverging Lenses

Diverging lenses diverge parallel rays of light and are thicker at the edges than in the middle.
