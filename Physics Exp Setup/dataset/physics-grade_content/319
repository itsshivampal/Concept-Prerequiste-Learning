19.2.3 Using Ohm's Law

We are now ready to see how Ohm's Law is used to analyse circuits.

Consider the circuit with an ohmic resistor, R. If the resistor has a resistance of 5 Ω and

voltage across the resistor is 5V, then we can use Ohm's law to calculate the current flowing

through the resistor.

R

Ohm's law is:

V = R · I

which can be rearranged to:

V

I =

R

The current flowing in the resistor is:

V

I =

5 Ω

= 1 A

CHAPTER 19. ELECTRIC CIRCUITS - GRADE 11 19.3

Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem

It is an Ohm's Law problem. So we use the equation:

V = R · I

Step 2 : Solve the problem

V = R · I

= (10)(4)

= 40 V

Step 3 : Write the final answer

The voltage across the resistor is 40 V.

Exercise: Ohm's Law

1. Calculate the resistance of a resistor that has a potential difference of 8 V

across it when a current of 2 A flows through it.

2. What current will flow through a resistor of 6 Ω when there is a potential

difference of 18 V across its ends?

3. What is the voltage acroos a 10 Ω resistor when a current of 1,5 A flows

though it?
