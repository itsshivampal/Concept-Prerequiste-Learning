Chapter 22

Mechanical Properties of Matter -

Grade 12

22.1 Introduction

In this chapter we will look at some mechanical (physical) properties of various materials that

we use. The mechanical properties of a material are those properties that are affected by forces

being applied to the material. These properties are important to consider when we are

constructing buildings, structures or modes of transport like an aeroplane.

22.2 Deformation of materials

22.2.1 Hooke's Law

Deformation (change of shape) of a solid is caused by a force that can either be compressive or

tensile when applied in one direction (plane). Compressive forces try to compress the object

(make it smaller or more compact) while tensile forces try to tear it apart. We can study these

effects by looking at what happens when you compress or expand a spring.

Hooke's Law describes the relationship between the force applied to a spring and its extension.

Historical Note: Hooke's Law

Hooke's law is named after the seventeenth century physicist Robert Hooke who discovered

it in 1660 (18 July 1635 - 3 March 1703).

Definition: Hooke's Law

In an elastic spring, the extension varies linearly with the force applied.

F = −kx where F is the force in newtons (N), k is the spring constant in N ·m−1 and x

is the extension in metres (m).
