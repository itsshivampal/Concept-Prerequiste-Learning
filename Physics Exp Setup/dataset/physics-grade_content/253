14.3.4 Speed of a Longitudinal Wave

The speed of a longitudinal wave is defined as:

v = f · λ

where

v = speed in m.s−1

f = frequency in Hz

λ = wavelength in m

Worked Example 102: Speed of longitudinal waves

Question: The musical note A is a sound wave. The note has a frequency of 440

Hz and a wavelength of 0,784 m. Calculate the speed of the musical note.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

f = 440 Hz

λ = 0,784 m

We need to calculate the speed of the musical note "A".

Step 2 : Determine how to approach based on what is given

We are given the frequency and wavelength of the note. We can therefore use:

v = f · λ

Step 3 : Calculate the wave speed

v = f · λ

= (440 Hz)(0,784m)

= 345m · s−1

Step 4 : Write the final answer

The musical note "A" travels at 345 m·s−1.

Worked Example 103: Speed of longitudinal waves

Question: A longitudinal wave travels into a medium in which its speed increases.

How does this affect its... (write only increases, decreases, stays the same).

1. period?

2. wavelength?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We need to determine how the period and wavelength of a longitudinal wave

change when its speed increases.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach based on what is given

We need to find the link between period, wavelength and wave speed.

Step 3 : Discuss how the period changes

We know that the frequency of a longitudinal wave is dependent on the frequency

of the vibrations that lead to the creation of the longitudinal wave. Therefore, the

frequency is always unchanged, irrespective of any changes in speed. Since the

period is the inverse of the frequency, the period remains the same.

Step 4 : Discuss how the wavelength changes

The frequency remains unchanged. According to the wave equation

v = fλ

if f remains the same and v increases, then λ, the wavelength, must also increase.
