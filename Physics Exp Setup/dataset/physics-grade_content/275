16.2 Standing Waves in String Instruments

Let us look at a basic "instrument": a string pulled tight and fixed at both ends. When you

pluck the string, you hear a certain pitch. This pitch is made by a certain frequency. What

causes the string to emit sounds at this pitch?

16.2 CHAPTER 16. THE PHYSICS OF MUSIC - GRADE 11

You have learned that the frequency of a standing wave depends on the length of the wave.

The wavelength depends on the nodes and anti-nodes. The longest wave that can "fit" on the

string is shown in Figure 16.1. This is called the fundamental or natural frequency of the

string. The string has nodes at both ends. The wavelength of the fundamental is twice the

length of the string.

Now put your finger on the center of the string. Hold it down gently and pluck it. The

standing wave now has a node in the middle of the string. There are three nodes. We can fit a

whole wave between the ends of the string. This means the wavelength is equal to the length

of the string. This wave is called the first harmonic. As we add more nodes, we find the second

harmonic, third harmonic, and so on. We must keep the nodes equally spaced or we will lose

our standing wave.

You should have found this formula:
2L
λ =
n− 1
Here, n is the number of nodes. L is the length of the string. The frequency f is:
v
f =
λ
Here, v is the velocity of the wave. This may seem confusing. The wave is a standing wave, so
how can it have a velocity? But one standing wave is made up of many waves that travel back
and forth on the string. Each of these waves has the same velocity. This speed depends on the
mass and tension of the string.
Worked Example 105: Harmonics on a String
Question: We have a standing wave on a string that is 65 cm long. The wave has
a velocity of 143 m.s−1 Find the frequencies of the fundamental, first, second, and
third harmonics.
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what is given and what is asked:
L = 65 cm = 0.65 m
v = 143 m.s−1
f = ?
To find the frequency we will use f = vλ
Step 2 : Find the wavelength for each harmonic:
To find f we need the wavelength of each harmonic (λ = 2Ln−1 ). The wavelength is
then substituted into f = v to find the harmonics. Table ?? below shows the
λ
calculations.

143 = 440 Hz
110 Hz is the natural frequency of the A string on a guitar. The third harmonic, at
440 Hz, is the note that orchestras use for tuning.
Extension: Guitar
Guitars use strings with high tension. The length, tension and mass of the
strings affect the pitches you hear. High tension and short strings make high
frequencies; Low tension and long strings make low frequencies. When a string is
first plucked, it vibrates at many frequencies. All of these except the harmonics are
quickly filtered out. The harmonics make up the tone we hear.
The body of a guitar acts as a large wooden soundboard. Here is how a
soundboard works: the body picks up the vibrations of the strings. It then passes
these vibrations to the air. A sound hole allows the soundboard of the guitar to
vibrate more freely. It also helps sound waves to get out of the body.

16.2 CHAPTER 16. THE PHYSICS OF MUSIC - GRADE 11
The neck of the guitar has thin metal bumps on it called frets. Pressing a
string against a fret shortens the length of that string. This raises the natural
frequency and the pitch of that string.
Most guitars use an "equal tempered" tuning of 12 notes per octave. A 6
string guitar has a range of 4 12 octaves with pitches from 82.407 Hz (low E) to
2093 kHz (high C). Harmonics may reach over 20 kHz, in the inaudible range.

Extension: Piano
Let us look at another stringed instrument: the piano. The piano has strings
that you can not see. When a key is pressed, a felt-tipped hammer hits a string
inside the piano. The pitch depends on the length, tension and mass of the string.
But there are many more strings than keys on a piano. This is because the short
and thin strings are not as loud as the long and heavy strings. To make up for this,
the higher keys have groups of two to four strings each.
The soundboard in a piano is a large cast iron plate. It picks up vibrations from
the strings. This heavy plate can withstand over 200 tons of pressure from string
tension! Its mass also allows the piano to sustain notes for long periods of time.
The piano has a wide frequency range, from 27,5 Hz (low A) to 4186,0 Hz
(upper C). But these are just the fundamental frequencies. A piano plays complex,
rich tones with over 20 harmonics per note. Some of these are out of the range of
human hearing. Very low piano notes can be heard mostly because of their higher
harmonics.
