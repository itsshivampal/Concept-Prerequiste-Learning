13.3 The Human Eye

Activity :: Investigation : Model of the Human Eye

This demonstration shows that:

1. The eyeball has a spherical shape.

2. The pupil is a small hole in the front and middle of the eye that lets light into

the eye.

3. The retina is at the back of the eyeball.

4. The images that we see are formed on the retina.

5. The images on the retina are upside down. The brain inverts the images so

that what we see is the right way up.

You will need:

1. a round, clear glass bowl

2. water

3. a sheet of cardboard covered with black paper

4. a sheet of cardboard covered with white paper

5. a small desk lamp with an incandescent light-bulb or a candle and a match

You will have to:

1. Fill the glass bowl with water.

2. Make a small hole in the middle of the black cardboard.

3. Place the black cardboard against one side of the bowl and the white cardboard

on the other side of the bowl so that it is opposite the black cardboard.

4. Turn on the lamp (or light the candle).

5. Place the lamp so it is shining through the hole in the black cardboard.

6. Make the room as dark as possible.

7. Move the white cardboard until an image of the light bulb or candle appears

on it.

You now have a working model of the human eye.

1. The hole in the black cardboard represents the pupil. The pupil is a small hole

in the front of the eyeball that lets light into the eye.

2. The round bowl of water represents the eyeball.

3. The white cardboard represents the retina. Images are projected onto the retina

and are then sent to the brain via the optic nerve.

Tasks

1. Is the image on the retina right-side up or upside down? Explain why.

2. Draw a simple labelled diagram of the model of the eye showing which part of

the eye each part of the model represents.

Table 13.1: Summary of image properties for converging and diverging lenses

Image Properties

Lens type Object Position Position Orientation Size Type

Converging > 2f < 2f inverted smaller real

Converging 2f 2f inverted same size real

Converging > f, < 2f > 2f inverted larger real

Converging f no image formed

Converging < f > f upright larger virtual

Diverging any position < f upright smaller virtual

Exercise: Diverging Lenses

1. An object 3 cm high is at right angles to the principal axis of a concave lens of

focal length 15 cm. If the distance from the object to the lens is 30 cm, find

the distance of the image from the lens, and its height. Is it real or virtual?

2. The image formed by a concave lens of focal length 10 cm is 7,5 cm from the

lens and is 1,5 cm high. Find the distance of the object from the lens, and its

height.

3. An object 6 cm high is 10 cm from a concave lens. The image formed is 3 cm

high. Find the focal length of the lens and the distance of the image from the

lens.
