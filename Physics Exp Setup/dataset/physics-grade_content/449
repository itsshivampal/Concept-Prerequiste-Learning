29.4 Active Circuit Elements

The components you have been learning about so far - resistors, capacitors and inductors -

are called passive components. They do not change their behaviour or physics in response to

changes in voltage or current. Active components are quite different. Their response to

changes in input allows them to make amplifiers, calculators and computers.
