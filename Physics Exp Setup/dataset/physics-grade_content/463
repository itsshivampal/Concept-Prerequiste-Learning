30.3 CHAPTER 30. EM RADIATION

2. Give examples of the behaviour of EM radiation which can best be explained

using a particle model.

30.3 The wave nature of electromagnetic radiation

Accelerating charges emit electromagnetic waves. We have seen that a changing electric field

generates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field generates an electric field. This is the

principle behind the propagation of electromagnetic waves, because electromagnetic waves,

unlike sound waves, do not need a medium to travel through. EM waves propagate when an

electric field oscillating in one plane produces a magnetic field oscillating in a plane at right

angles to it, which produces an oscillating electric field, and so on. The propagation of

electromagnetic waves can be described as mutual induction.

These mutually regenerating fields travel through space at a constant speed of 3× 108 m · s−1,
