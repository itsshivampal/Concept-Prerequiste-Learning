11.8 Components of Vectors

In the discussion of vector addition we saw that a number of vectors acting together can be

combined to give a single vector (the resultant). In much the same way a single vector can be

broken down into a number of vectors which when added give that original vector. These vectors

which sum to the original are called components of the original vector. The process of breaking

a vector into its components is called resolving into components.

While summing a given set of vectors gives just one answer (the resultant), a single vector can be

resolved into infinitely many sets of components. In the diagrams below the same black vector

is resolved into different pairs of components. These components are shown as dashed lines.

When added together the dashed vectors give the original black vector (i.e. the original vector

is the resultant of its components).

In practice it is most useful to resolve a vector into components which are at right angles to one

another, usually horizontal and vertical.

Any vector can be resolved into a horizontal and a vertical component. If A~ is a vector, then

the horizontal component of A~ is A~x and the vertical component is A~y.

A~ A~y

A~x

Worked Example 57: Resolving a vector into components

Question: A motorist undergoes a displacement of 250 km in a direction 30◦ north

of east. Resolve this displacement into components in the directions north (~xN ) and

east (~xE).

Step 2 : Determine the vector component

Next we resolve the displacement into its components north and east. Since these

directions are perpendicular to one another, the components form a right-angled

triangle with the original displacement as its hypotenuse.

Notice how the two components acting together give the original vector as their

resultant.

Step 3 : Determine the lengths of the component vectors

Now we can use trigonometry to calculate the magnitudes of the components of the

original displacement:

xN = (250)(sin 30

◦)

= 125 km

and

xE = (250)(cos 30

◦)

= 216,5 km

Remember xN and xE are the magnitudes of the components - they are in the

directions north and east respectively.

Extension: Block on an incline

As a further example of components let us consider a block of mass m placed on

a frictionless surface inclined at some angle θ to the horizontal. The block will

obviously slide down the incline, but what causes this motion?

The forces acting on the block are its weight mg and the normal force N exerted

by the surface on the object. These two forces are shown in the diagram below.

Now the object's weight can be resolved into components parallel and perpen-
dicular to the inclined surface. These components are shown as dashed arrows in
the diagram above and are at right angles to each other. The components have
been drawn acting from the same point. Applying the parallelogram method, the
two components of the block's weight sum to the weight vector.
To find the components in terms of the weight we can use trigonometry:
Fg‖ = mg sin θ
Fg⊥ = mg cos θ
The component of the weight perpendicular to the slope Fg⊥ exactly balances the
normal force N exerted by the surface. The parallel component, however, Fg‖ is
unbalanced and causes the block to slide down the slope.
