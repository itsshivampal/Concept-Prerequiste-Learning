6.4.6 Superposition and Interference

If two waves meet interesting things can happen. Waves are basically collective motion of

particles. So when two waves meet they both try to impose their collective motion on the

particles. This can have quite different results.

If two identical (same wavelength, amplitude and frequency) waves are both trying to form a

peak then they are able to achieve the sum of their efforts. The resulting motion will be a peak

which has a height which is the sum of the heights of the two waves. If two waves are both

trying to form a trough in the same place then a deeper trough is formed, the depth of which is

the sum of the depths of the two waves. Now in this case, the two waves have been trying to

do the same thing, and so add together constructively. This is called constructive interference.

A=0,5m

+

B=1,0m

=

A+B=1,5m

If one wave is trying to form a peak and the other is trying to form a trough, then they are

competing to do different things. In this case, they can cancel out. The amplitude of the

resulting wave will depend on the amplitudes of the two waves that are interfering. If the depth

of the trough is the same as the height of the peak nothing will happen. If the height of the

peak is bigger than the depth of the trough, a smaller peak will appear. And if the trough is

deeper then a less deep trough will appear. This is destructive interference.
