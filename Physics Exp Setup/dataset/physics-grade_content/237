13.3.2 Defects of Vision

In a normal eye the image is focused on the retina.

If the muscles in the eye are unable to accommodate adequately, the image will not be in focus.

This leads to problems with vision. There are three basic conditions that arise:

1. short-sightedness

2. long-sightedness

3. astigmatism

Short-sightedness

Short-sightedness or myopia is a defect of vision which means that the image is focused in front

of the retina. Close objects are seen clearly but distant objects appear blurry. This condition

can be corrected by placing a diverging lens in front of the eye. The diverging lens spreads out

light rays before they enter the eye. The situation for short-sightedness and how to correct it is

shown in Figure 13.17.

Long-sightedness

Long-sightedness or hyperopia is a defect of vision which means that the image is focused in

behind the retina. People with this condition can see distant objects clearly, but not close ones.

A converging lens in front of the eye corrects long-sightedness by converging the light rays slightly

before they enter the eye. Reading glasses are an example of a converging lens used to correct

long-sightedness.

Astigmatism

Astigmatism is characterised by a cornea or lens that is not spherical, but is more curved in one

plane compared to another. This means that horizontal lines may be focused at a different point

to vertical lines. Astigmatism is corrected by a special lens, which has different focal lengths in

the vertical and horizontal planes.
