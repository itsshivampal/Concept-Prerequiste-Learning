1. Which one of the following is NOT a unit of impulse?

A N · s

B kg · m · s−1

C J · m · s−1

D J ·m−1 · s

2. A toy car of mass 1 kg moves eastwards with a speed of 2 m·s−1. It collides head-on with

a toy train. The train has a mass of 2 kg and is moving at a speed of 1,5 m·s−1westwards.

The car rebounds (bounces back) at 3,4 m·s−1and the train rebounds at 1,2 m·s−1.

2.1 Calculate the change in momentum for each toy.

2.2 Determine the impulse for each toy.

2.3 Determine the duration of the collision if the magnitude of the force exerted by each

toy is 8 N.

3. A bullet of mass 20 g strikes a target at 300 m·s−1and exits at 200 m·s−1. The tip of the

bullet takes 0,0001s to pass through the target. Determine:

3.1 the change of momentum of the bullet.

3.2 the impulse of the bullet.

3.3 the magnitude of the force experienced by the bullet.

4. A bullet of mass 20 g strikes a target at 300 m·s−1. Determine under which circumstances

the bullet experiences the greatest change in momentum, and hence impulse:

4.1 When the bullet exits the target at 200 m·s−1.

4.2 When the bullet stops in the target.

4.3 When the bullet rebounds at 200 m·s−1.

5. A ball with a mass of 200 g strikes a wall at right angles at a velocity of 12 m·s−1and

rebounds at a velocity of 9 m·s−1.

5.1 Calculate the change in the momentum of the ball.

5.2 What is the impulse of the wall on the ball?

5.3 Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted by the wall on the ball if the collision

takes 0,02s.

6. If the ball in the previous problem is replaced with a piece of clay of 200 g which is thrown

against the wall with the same velocity, but then sticks to the wall, calculate:

6.1 The impulse of the clay on the wall.

6.2 The force exerted by the clay on the wall if it is in contact with the wall for 0,5 s

before it comes to rest.

Now we calculate the change in momentum,

p = pf − pi

= mvf −mvi

= m(vf − vi)

= (0,156)((+10)− (−15))

= +3,9

= 3,9 kg · m · s−1in the direction from batsman to bowler

Step 5 : Determine the impulse

Finally since impulse is just the change in momentum of the ball,

Impulse = ∆p

= 3,9 kg · m · s−1in the direction from batsman to bowler

Step 6 : Determine the average force exerted by the bat

Impulse = Fnet∆t = ∆p

We are given ∆t and we have calculated the impulse of the ball.

Fnet∆t = Impulse

Fnet(0,13) = +3,9

+3,9

Fnet =

0,13

= +30

= 30N in the direction from batsman to bowler
