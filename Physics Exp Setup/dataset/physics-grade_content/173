11.4.3 Bearing

The final method of expressing direction is to use a bearing. A bearing is a direction relative to

a fixed point.

Given just an angle, the convention is to define the angle with respect to the North. So, a vector

with a direction of 110◦ has been rotated clockwise 110◦ relative to the North. A bearing is

always written as a three digit number, for example 275◦ or 080◦ (for 80◦).

Exercise: Scalars and Vectors

1. Classify the following quantities as scalars or vectors:

1.1 12 km

1.2 1 m south

1.3 2 m·s−1, 45◦

1.4 075◦, 2 cm

1.5 100 km·hr−1, 0◦

2. Use two different notations to write down the direction of the vector in each of

the following diagrams:

11.4.2 Compass Directions N

Another common method of expressing direc-

tions is to use the points of a compass: North, W E

South, East, and West.

S

If a vector does not point exactly in one

of the compass directions, then we use an angle.

For example, we can have a vector pointing 40◦

North of West. Start with the vector pointing

along the West direction:

Then rotate the vector towards the north

until there is a 40◦ angle between the vector

and the West.

The direction of this vector can also be described

40◦

as: W 40◦ N (West 40◦ North); or N 50◦ W

(North 50◦ West)
