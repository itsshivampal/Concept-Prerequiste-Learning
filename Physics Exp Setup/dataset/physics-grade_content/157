10.4.2 Resistors in electric circuits

It is important to understand what effect adding resistors to a circuit has on the total resistance

of a circuit and on the current that can flow in the circuit.

Resistors in series

When we add resistors in series to a circuit, we increase the resistance to the flow of current.

There is only one path that the current can flow down and the current is the same at all places

in the series circuit. Take a look at the diagram below: On the left there is a circuit with a single

resistor and a battery. No matter where we measure the current, it is the same in a series circuit.

On the right, we have added a second resistor in series to the circuit. The total resistance of

the circuit has increased and you can see from the reading on the ammeter that the current in

the circuit has decreased.

R = 2 Ω R = 2 Ω

A I = 1 A A I = 0.67 A

(the current is

A I = 1 A smaller) A I = 0.67 A

(the current is

V = 2 V V = 2 V smaller)

R = 1 Ω

The current in a series circuit Adding a resistor to the circuit

is the same everywhere increases the total resistance

Resistors in parallel

In contrast to the series case, when we add resistors in parallel, we create more paths along

which current can flow. By doing this we decrease the total resistance of the circuit!

Take a look at the diagram below. On the left we have the same circuit as in the previous

diagram with a battery and a resistor. The ammeter shows a current of 1 ampere. On the right

we have added a second resistor in parallel to the first resistor. This has increased the number

of paths (branches) the charge can take through the circuit - the total resistance has decreased.

You can see that the current in the circuit has increased. Also notice that the current in the

different branches can be different.

R = 2 Ω R = 1 Ω

Adding a resistor to the circuit in

parallel decreases the total resistance
