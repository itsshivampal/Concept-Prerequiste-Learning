5.3.2 Pulse Speed

Definition: Pulse Speed

Pulse speed is the distance a pulse travels in a specific time.

In Chapter 3 we saw that speed was defined as the distance travelled in a specified time. We

can use the same definition of speed to calculate how fast a pulse travels. If the pulse travels a

distance d in a time t, then the pulse speed v is:

d

v =

t

Worked Example 22: Pulse Speed

Question: A pulse covers a distance of 2 m in 4 s on a heavy rope. Calculate the

pulse speed.

Answer

Step 5 : Determine what is given and what is required

We are given:

• the distance travelled by the pulse: d = 2 m

• the time taken to travel 2 m: t = 4 s

We are required to calculate the speed of the pulse.

Step 6 : Determine how to approach the problem

We can use:

d

v =

t

to calculate the speed of the pulse.

Step 7 : Calculate the pulse speed

=

4 s

= 0,5m · s−1

Step 8 : Write the final answer

The pulse speed is 0,5 m·s−1.

Important: The pulse speed depends on the properties of the medium and not on the

amplitude or pulse length of the pulse.

Exercise: Pulse Speed

1. A pulse covers a distance of 5 m in 15 seconds. Calculate the speed of the

pulse.

2. A pulse has a speed of 5 cm.s−1. How far does it travel in 2,5 seconds?

3. A pulse has a speed of 0,5 m·s−1. How long does it take to cover a distance

of 25 cm?

4. How long will it take a pulse moving at 0,25 m·s−1 to travel a distance of 20 m?

5. Examine the two pulses below and

state which has the higher speed. Ex-

plain your answer. B

A

6. Ocean waves do not bring more water onto the shore until the beach is com-

pletely submerged. Explain why this is so.

CHAPTER 5. TRANSVERSE PULSES - GRADE 10 5.3

What do you notice about the values of a and p?

In the activity, we found that the values for how high the pulse (a) is and how wide the pulse

(p) is the same at different times. Pulse length and amplitude are two important quantities of

a pulse.
