20.4.5 Reverse biased

N P

in this case the external field pushes e- back to the n-region while more holes into the p-region,

as a result you get no current flow. Only the small number of thermally released minority

carriers (holes in the n-type region and e- in the p-type region) will be able to cross the

junction and form a very small current, but for all practical purposes, this can be ignored

of course if the reverse biased potential is large enough you get avalanche break down and

current flow in the opposite direction. In many cases, except for Zener diodes, you most likely

will destroy the diode.
