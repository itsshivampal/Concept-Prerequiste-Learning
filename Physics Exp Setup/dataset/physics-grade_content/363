22.1 Introduction

In this chapter we will look at some mechanical (physical) properties of various materials that

we use. The mechanical properties of a material are those properties that are affected by forces

being applied to the material. These properties are important to consider when we are

constructing buildings, structures or modes of transport like an aeroplane.
