29.6.1 Binary numbers

In normal (denary) numbers, we write 9+1 as 10. The fact that the ‘1' in 10 is the second digit

from the right tells us that it actually means 10 and not 1. Similarly, the ‘3' in 365 represents

300 because it is the third digit from the right. You could write 365 as 3× 100 + 6× 10 + 5.

You will notice the pattern that the nth digit from the right represents 10n−1. In binary, we

use the nth digit from the right to represent 2n−1. Thus 2 is written as 10 in binary. Similarly

22 = 4 is written as 100 in binary, and 23 = 8 is written as 1000 in binary.

Worked Example 183: Conversion of Binary Numbers to Denary Numbers

Question: Convert the binary number 10101 to its denary equivalent.

Answer

We start on the right. The ‘1' on the right does indeed represent one. The next ‘1'

is in the third place from the right, and represents 22 = 4. The next ‘1' is in the

fifth place from the right and represents 24 = 16. Accordingly, the binary number

10101 represents 16+4+1 = 21 in denary notation.

Worked Example 184: Conversion of Denary Numbers to Binary Numbers

Question: Convert the decimal number 12 to its binary equivalent.

Answer

Firstly we write 12 as a sum of powers of 2, so 12 = 8+4. In binary, eight is 1000,

and four is 100. This means that twelve = eight + four must be 1000+100 = 1100

in binary. You could also write 12 as 1× 8+ 1× 4+ 0× 2+ 0× 1 = 1100 in binary.

CHAPTER 29. ELECTRONICS - GRADE 12 29.6

Itneterreessttinigng How do you write numbers as a sum of powers of two? The first power of two

FFacctt (the largest) is the largest power of two which is not larger than the number

you are working with. In our last example, where we wanted to know what

twelve was in binary, the largest power of two which is not larger than 12 is 8.

Thus 12 = 8 + something. By arithmetic, the ‘something' must be 4, and the

largest power of two not larger than this is 4 exactly. Thus 12 = 8 + 4, and we

have finished.

A more complicated example would be to write one hundred in binary. The

largest power of two not larger than 100 is 64 (1000000 in binary). Subtracting

64 from 100 leaves 36. The largest power of two not larger than 36 is 32

(100000 in binary). Removing this leaves a remainder of 4, which is a power of

two itself (100 in binary). Thus one hundred is 64 + 32 + 4, or in binary

1000000 + 100000 + 100 = 1100100.

Once a number is written in binary, it can be represented using the low and high voltage levels

of digital electronics. We demonstrate how this is done by showing you how an electronic

counter works.

29.6 Using and Storing Binary Numbers

In the previous section, we saw how the numbers 0 and 1 could represent ‘false' and ‘true' and

could be used in decision making. Often we want to program a computer to count with

numbers. To do this we need a way of writing any number using nothing other than 0 and 1.

When written in this way, numbers are called binary numbers.

Definition: Binary

A way of writing any number using only the digits 0 and 1.
