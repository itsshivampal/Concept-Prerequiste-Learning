29.4.3 Transistor

The diode is the simplest semiconductor device, made up of a p-type semiconductor and an

n-type semiconductor in contact. It can conduct in only one direction, but it cannot control the

size of an electric current. Transistors are more complicated electronic components which can

control the size of the electric current flowing through them.

This enables them to be used in amplifiers. A small signal from a microphone or a radio

antenna can be used to control the transistor. In response, the transistor will then increase and

decrease a much larger current which flows through the speakers.

Itneterreessttinigng One of the earliest popular uses of transistors was in cheap and portable radios.

FFacctt Before that, radios were much more expensive and contained glass valves which

were fragile and needed replacing. In some parts of the world you can still hear

people talking about their ‘transistor' - they mean their portable radio.

You can also use a small current to turn the transistor on and off. The transistor then controls

a more complicated or powerful current through other components. When a transistor is used

in this way it is said to be in switching mode as it is acting as a remotely controlled switch. As

we shall see in the final sections of this chapter, switching circuits can be used in a computer

to process and store digital information. A computer would not work without the millions (or

billions) of transistors in it.

There are two main types of transistor - bipolar transistors (NPN or PNP), and field effect

transistors (FETs). Both use doped semiconductors, but in different ways. You are mainly

required to know about field effect transistors (FETs), however we have to give a brief

description of bipolar transistors so that you see the difference.

Bipolar Transistors

Bipolar transistors are made of a doped semiconductor ‘sandwich'. In an NPN transistor, a

very thin layer of p-type semiconductor is in between two thicker layers of n-type

semiconductor. This is shown in Figure 29.11. Similarly an PNP transistor consists of a very

thin n-type layer in between two thicker layers of p-type semiconductor.

In an NPN transistor a small current of electrons flows from the emitter (E) to the base (B).

Simultaneously, a much larger current of electrons flows from the emitter (E) to the collector

(C). If you lower the number of electrons able to leave the transistor at the base (B), the

transistor automatically reduces the number of electrons flowing from emitter (E) to collector

(C). Similarly, if you increase the current of electrons flowing out of the base (B), the transistor

automatically also increases the current of electrons flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C).

The transistor is designed so that the current of electrons from emitter to collector (IEC) is

proportional to the current of electrons from emitter to base (IEB). The constant of

proportionality is known as the current gain β. So IEC = βIEB .

How does it do it? The answer comes from our work with diodes. Electrons arriving at the

emitter (n-type semiconductor) will naturally flow through into the central p-type since the

base-emitter junction is forward biased. However if none of these electrons are removed from

the base, the electrons flowing into the base from the emitter will fill all of the available ‘holes'.

Accordingly, a large depletion band will be set up. This will act as an insulator preventing

current flow into the collector as well. On the other hand, if the base is connected to a positive

voltage, a small number of electrons will be removed by the base connection. This will prevent

the ‘holes' in the base becoming filled up, and no depletion band will form. While some

electrons from the emitter leave via the base connection, the bulk of them flow straight on to

the collector. You may wonder how the electrons get from the base into the collector (it seems

to be reverse biased). The answer is complicated, but the important fact is that the p-type

layer is extremely thin. As long as there is no depletion layer, the bulk of the electrons will have

no difficulty passing straight from the n-type emitter into the n-type collector. A more

satisfactory answer can be given to a university student once band theory has been explained.

Summing up, in an NPN transistor, a small flow of electrons from emitter (E) to base (B)

allows a much larger flow of electrons from emitter (E) to collector (C). Given that

conventional current (flowing from + to −) is in the opposite direction to electron flow, we say

that a small conventional current from base to emitter allows a large current to flow from

collector to emitter.

A PNP transistor works the other way. A small conventional current from emitter to base

allows a much larger conventional current to flow from emitter to collector. The operation is

more complicated to explain since the principal charge carrier in a PNP transistor is not the

electron but the ‘hole'.

The operation of NPN and PNP transistors (in terms of conventional currents) is summarized

in Figure 29.12.

FFacctt inventions in modern history, ranking with banking and the printing press. Key

to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be

produced in huge numbers using simple techniques, resulting in vanishingly

small prices. Computer "chips" consist of millions of transistors and sell for

Rands, with per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents. The low cost has
meant that the transistor has become an almost universal tool for
non-mechanical tasks. Whereas a common device, say a refrigerator, would
have used a mechanical device for control, today it is often less expensive to
simply use a few million transistors and the appropriate computer program to
carry out the same task through "brute force". Today transistors have replaced
almost all electromechanical devices, most simple feedback systems, and appear
in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars.
Itneterreessttinigng The transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories in December 1947 (first
FFacctt demonstrated on December 23) by John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and
William Bradford Shockley, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in
1956.
The Field Effect Transistor (FET)
To control a bipolar transistors, you control the current flowing into or out of its base. The
other type of transistor is the field effect transistor (FET). FETs work using control voltages
instead. Accordingly they can be controlled with much smaller currents and are much more
economic to use.
Itneterreessttinigng No-one would build a computer with billions of bipolar transistors - the
FFacctt current in each transistor's base might be small, but when you add up all of the

base currents in the millions of transistors, the computer as a whole would be
consuming a great deal of electricity and making a great deal of heat. Not only
is this wasteful, it would prevent manufacturers making a computer of
convenient size. If the transistors were too close together, they would overheat.

structure. The diagram on the right shows its circuit symbol.
The three terminals of the FET are called the source (S), drain (D) and gate (G), as shown in
Figure 29.13. When the gate is not connected, a current of electrons can flow from source (S)
to drain (D) easily along the channel. The source is, accordingly, the negative terminal of the
transistor. The drain, where the electrons come out, is the positive terminal of the transistor.
A few electrons will flow from the n-type channel into the p-type semiconductor of the gate
when the device is manufactured. However, as these electrons are not removed (the gate is not
connected), a depletion band is set up which prevents further flow into the gate.
In operation, the gate is connected to negative voltages relative to the source. This makes the
p-n junction between gate and channel reverse-biased. Accordingly no current flows from the
source into the gate. When the voltage of the gate is lowered (made more negative), the
depletion band becomes wider. This enlarged depletion band takes up some of the space of the
channel. So the lower the voltage of the gate (the more negative it is relative to the source),
the larger the depletion band. The larger the depletion band, the narrower the channel. The
narrower the channel, the harder it is for electrons to flow from source to drain.
The voltage of the gate is not the only factor affecting the current of electrons between the
source and the drain. If the external circuit has a low resistance, electrons are able to leave the
drain easily. If the external circuit has a high resistance, electrons leave the drain slowly. This
creates a kind of ‘traffic jam' which slows the passage of further electrons. In this way, the
voltage of the drain regulates itself, and is more or less independent of the current demanded
from the drain.
Once these two factors have been taken into account, it is fair to say that the positive output
voltage (the voltage of the drain relative to the source) is proportional to the negative input
voltage (the voltage of the gate relative to the source).
For this reason, the field effect transistor is known as a voltage amplifier. This contrasts with
the bipolar transistor which is a current amplifier.

The three terminals of the FET are called the source (S), drain (D) and gate (G), as shown in

Figure 29.13. When the gate is not connected, a current of electrons can flow from source (S)

to drain (D) easily along the channel. The source is, accordingly, the negative terminal of the

transistor. The drain, where the electrons come out, is the positive terminal of the transistor.

A few electrons will flow from the n-type channel into the p-type semiconductor of the gate

when the device is manufactured. However, as these electrons are not removed (the gate is not

connected), a depletion band is set up which prevents further flow into the gate.

In operation, the gate is connected to negative voltages relative to the source. This makes the

p-n junction between gate and channel reverse-biased. Accordingly no current flows from the

source into the gate. When the voltage of the gate is lowered (made more negative), the

depletion band becomes wider. This enlarged depletion band takes up some of the space of the

channel. So the lower the voltage of the gate (the more negative it is relative to the source),

the larger the depletion band. The larger the depletion band, the narrower the channel. The

narrower the channel, the harder it is for electrons to flow from source to drain.

The voltage of the gate is not the only factor affecting the current of electrons between the

source and the drain. If the external circuit has a low resistance, electrons are able to leave the

drain easily. If the external circuit has a high resistance, electrons leave the drain slowly. This

creates a kind of ‘traffic jam' which slows the passage of further electrons. In this way, the

voltage of the drain regulates itself, and is more or less independent of the current demanded

from the drain.

For this reason, the field effect transistor is known as a voltage amplifier. This contrasts with

the bipolar transistor which is a current amplifier.
