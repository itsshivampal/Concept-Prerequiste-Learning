2.9 A sanity test

A sanity test is a method of checking whether an answer makes sense. All we have to do is to

take a careful look at our answer and ask the question Does the answer make sense?

Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was

1 000 000 people you would know it was wrong - it is not possible to have that many people

in a classroom. That is all a sanity test is - is your answer insane or not?

It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let us consider masses.

An average person has a mass around 70 kg, while the heaviest person in medical history had a

mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person's mass and you get 7 000 kg, this should

fail your sanity check - your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere.

In the same way an answer of 0.01 kg should fail your sanity test.

The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are.

For example, finding the number of learners in a classroom you need to know that there are

usually 20-50 people in a classroom. If you get and answer of 2500, you should realise that it is

wrong.

Activity :: The scale of the matter... : Try to get an idea of the typical

values for the following physical quantities and write your answers into the

table:

Category Quantity Minimum Maximum

speed of cars on freeways

speed of trains

distance between home and school
