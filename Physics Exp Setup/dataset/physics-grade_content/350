21.2.3 Graphs of Vertical Projectile Motion

Vertical projectile motion is similar to motion at constant acceleration. In Chapter 3 you

learned about the graphs for motion at constant acceleration. The graphs for vertical projectile

motion are therefore identical to the graphs for motion under constant acceleration.

When we draw the graphs for vertical projectile motion, we consider two main situations: an

object moving upwards and an object moving downwards.

If we take the upwards direction as positive then for an object moving upwards we get the

graphs shown in Figure 21.9.

upwards and then falls to the ground. Draw graphs of position vs. time, velocity

vs. time and acceleration vs. time. Choose upwards as the positive direction.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to draw graphs of

1. ∆x vs. t

2. v vs. t

3. a vs. t

Step 2 : Analysis of problem

There are two parts to the motion of the ball:

1. ball travelling upwards from the building

2. ball falling to the ground

We examine each of these parts separately. To

be able to draw the graphs, we need to determine

the time taken and displacement for each of the

motions.

vf = 0m·s−1

g = −9,8m·s−2

vi = 4,9m·s−1

Step 3 : Find the height and the time taken for the first motion.

For the first part of the motion we have:

• vi = +4,9m · s−1

• vf = 0m · s−1

• g = −9,8m · s−2

Therefore we can use v2f = v

solve for the time.

Step 2 : Analysis of problem
There are two parts to the motion of the ball:

For the second part of the motion we have:

Step 5 : Graph of position vs. time
The ball starts from a position of 20 m (at t = 0 s) from the ground and moves
upwards until it reaches (20 + 1,225) m (at t = 0,5 s). It then falls back to 20 m
(at t = 0,5 + 0,5 = 1,0 s) and then falls to the ground, ∆ x = 0 m at (t = 0,5 +
2,08 = 2,58 s).

Step 6 : Graph of velocity vs. time
The ball starts off with a velocity of +4,9 m·s−1at t = 0 s, it then reaches a
velocity of 0 m·s−1at t = 0,5 s. It stops and falls back to the Earth. At t = 1,0 it
has a velocity of -4,9 m·s−1. This is the same as the initial upwards velocity but it
is downwards. It carries on at constant acceleration until t = 2,58 s. In other
words, the velocity graph will be a straight line. The final velocity of the ball can
be calculated as follows:
vf = vi + gt

Step 7 : Graph of a vs t
We chose upwards to be positive. The acceleration of the ball is downward.
g = −9.8m · s−2. Because the acceleration is constant throughout the motion, the
graph looks like this:

Answer
Step 1 : Find the height of the window.
The initial position of the ball will tell us how high the window is. From the y-axis
on the graph we can see that the ball is 4 m from the ground.
The window is therefore 4 m above the ground.
Step 2 : Find the time taken to reach the maximum height.
The maximum height is where the position-time graph show the maximum position
- the top of the curve. This is when t = 0,2 s.

21.2 CHAPTER 21. MOTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS - GRADE 12
It takes the ball 0,2 seconds to reach the maximum height.
Step 3 : Find the initial velocity (vi) of the ball.
To find the initial velocity we only look at the first part of the motion of the ball.
That is from when the ball is released until it reaches its maximum height. We
have the following for this: Choose upwards as positive.
t = 0,2 s
g = −9,8 m · s−2
vf = 0 m · s−1(because the ball stops)
To calculate the initial velocity of the ball (vi), we use:
vf = vi + gt
0 = vi + (−9,8)(0,2)
vi = 1,96m · s−1
The initial velocity of the ball is 1,96 m·s−1upwards.
Step 4 : Find the maximum height (∆x) of the ball.
To find the maximum height we look at the initial motion of the ball. We have the
following:
t = 0,2 s
g = −9,8 m · s−2
vf = 0 m · s−1(because the ball stops)
vi = +1,96m · s−1(calculated above)
To calculate the maximum height (∆x) we use:
1
∆x = vit+ gt
2
2
1
∆x = (1,96)(0,2) + (−9,8)(0,2)2
2
∆x = 0,196m
The maximum height of the ball is (4 + 0,196) = 4,196 m above the ground.
Step 5 : Find the final velocity (vf) of the ball.
To find the final velocity of the ball we look at the second part of the motion. For
this we have:
∆x = −4,196 m (because upwards is positive)
g = −9,8 m · s−2
vi = 0 m · s−1
We can use (vf )
2 = (vi)
2 + 2g∆x to calculate the final velocity of the ball.
(vf )
2 = (vi)
2 + 2g∆x
(vf )
2 = (0)2 + 2(−9,8)(−4,196)
(vf )
2 = 82,2416
vf = 9,0687...m · s−1
The final velocity of the ball is 9,07 m·s−1downwards.

Answer
Step 1 : Describe the motion of the ball.
We need to study the velocity-time graph to answer this question. We will break
the motion of the ball up into two time zones: t = 0 s to t = 2 s and t = 2 s to t
= 4 s.
From t = 0 s to t = 2 s the following happens:
The ball starts to move at an initial velocity of 19,6 m·s−1and decreases its velocity
to 0 m·s−1at t = 2 s. At t = 2 s the velocity of the ball is 0 m·s−1and therefore it
stops.
From t = 2 s to t = 4 s the following happens:
The ball moves from a velocity of 0 m·s−1to 19,6 m·s−1in the opposite direction to
the original motion.
If we assume that the ball is hit straight up in the air (and we take upwards as
positive), it reaches its maximum height at t = 2 s, stops, turns around and falls
back to the Earth to reach the ground at t = 4 s.
Step 2 : Draw the displacement-time graph.
To draw this graph, we need to determine the displacements at t = 2 s and t = 4 s.
At t = 2 s:
The displacement is equal to the area under the graph:
Area under graph = Area of triangle
Area = 12bh
Area = 12 × 2 × 19,6
Displacement = 19,6 m
At t = 4 s:
The displacement is equal to the area under the whole graph (top and bottom).
Remember that an area under the time line must be substracted:
Area under graph = Area of triangle 1 + Area of triangle 2
Area = 12bh +
1
2bh
Area = (12 × 2 × 19,6) + (12 × 2 × (-19,6))
Area = 19,6 - 19,6
Displacement = 0 m
The displacement-time graph for motion at constant acceleration is a curve. The
graph will look like this:

Step 3 : Draw the acceleration-time graph.
To draw the acceleration vs. time graph, we need to know what the acceleration is.
The velocity-time graph is a straight line which means that the acceleration is
constant. The gradient of the line will give the acceleration.
The line has a negative slope (goes down towards the left) which means that the
acceleration has a negative value.
Calculate the gradient of the line:
