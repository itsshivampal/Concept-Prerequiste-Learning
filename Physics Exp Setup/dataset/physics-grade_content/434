28.2.4 Exercise - generators and motors

1. State the difference between a generator and a motor.

2. Use Faraday's Law to explain why a current is induced in a coil that is rotated in a

magnetic field.

3. Explain the basic principle of an AC generator in which a coil is mechanically rotated in a

magnetic field. Draw a diagram to support your answer.

4. Explain how a DC generator works. Draw a diagram to support your answer. Also,

describe how a DC generator differs from an AC generator.

5. Explain why a current-carrying coil placed in a magnetic field (but not parallel to the

field) will turn. Refer to the force exerted on moving charges by a magnetic field and the

torque on the coil.

6. Explain the basic principle of an electric motor. Draw a diagram to support your answer.

7. Give examples of the use of AC and DC generators.

8. Give examples of the use of motors

Activity :: Research Topic : Alternators

Try to find out the different ampere values produced by alternators for different

types of machines. Compare these to understand what numbers make sense in the

real world. You will find different numbers for cars, trucks, buses, boats etc. Try to

find out what other machines might have alternators.

A car also contains a DC electric motor, the starter motor, to turn over the engine to start it.

A starter consists of the very powerful DC electric motor and starter solenoid that is attached

to the motor. A starter motor requires very high current to crank the engine, that's why it's

connected to the battery with large cables.

Electricity Generation

AC generators are mainly used in the real-world to generate electricity.
