6.2.1 Peaks and Troughs

Waves consist of moving peaks (or crests) and troughs. A peak is the highest point the medium

rises to and a trough is the lowest point the medium sinks to.

Peaks and troughs on a transverse wave are shown in Figure 6.2.

Definition: Peaks and troughs

A peak is a point on the wave where the displacement of the medium is at a maximum.

A point on the wave is a trough if the displacement of the medium at that point is at a

minimum.

3. In which direction do the pulses travel?

4. Tie a ribbon to the middle of the rope. This indicates a particle in the rope.

Flick rope up and down

5. Flick the rope continuously. Watch the ribbon carefully as the pulses travel

through the rope. What happens to the ribbon?

6. Draw a picture to show the motion of the ribbon. Draw the ribbon as a dot

and use arrows.

In the Activity, you have created waves. The medium through which these waves propagated

was the rope, which is obviously made up of a very large number of particles (atoms). From the

activity, you would have noticed that the wave travelled from left to right, but the particles (the

ribbon) moved only up and down.

wave motion

Figure 6.1: A transverse wave, showing the direction of motion of the wave perpendicular to the

direction in which the particles move.

When the particles of a medium move at right angles to the direction of propagation of a wave,

the wave is called transverse. For waves, there is no net displacement of the particles (they

return to their equilibrium position), but there is a net displacement of the wave. There are thus

two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave.
