3.2 Reference Point, Frame of Reference and Position

The most important idea when studying motion, is you have to know where you are. The

word position describes your location (where you are). However, saying that you are here is

meaningless, and you have to specify your position relative to a known reference point. For

example, if you are 2 m from the doorway, inside your classroom then your reference point is

the doorway. This defines your position inside the classroom. Notice that you need a reference

point (the doorway) and a direction (inside) to define your location.
