7.6.1 Total Internal Reflection

Activity :: Investigation : Total Internal Reflection

Work in groups of four. Each group will need a raybox (or torch) with slit,

triangular glass prism and protractor. If you do not have a raybox, use a torch and

stick two pieces of tape over the lens so that only a thin beam of light is visible.

Aim:

To investigate total internal reflection.

When we increase the angle of incidence, we reach a point where the angle of refraction is 90◦
and the refracted ray runs along the surface of the medium. This angle of incidence is called the
critical angle.
Definition: Critical Angle
The critical angle is the angle of incidence where the angle of reflection is 90◦. The light
must shine from a dense to a less dense medium.
If the angle of incidence is bigger than this critical angle, the refracted ray will not emerge from
the medium, but will be reflected back into the medium. This is called total internal reflection.
Total internal reflection takes place when
• light shines from an optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium.
• the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.
Definition: Total Internal Reflection
Total internal reflection takes place when light is reflected back into the medium because
the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.

Figure 7.22: Diagrams to show the critical angle and total internal reflection.
Each medium has its own unique critical angle. For example, the critical angle for glass is 42◦,
and that of water is 48,8◦. We can calculate the critical angle for any medium.
Calculating the Critical Angle
Now we shall learn how to derive the value of the critical angle for two given media. The process
is fairly simple and involves just the use of Snell's Law that we have already studied. To recap,
Snell's Law states:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
158
CHAPTER 7. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS - GRADE 10 7.6
where n1 is the refractive index of material 1, n2 is the refractive index of material 2, θ1 is the
angle of incidence and θ2 is the angle of refraction. For total internal reflection we know that
the angle of incidence is the critical angle. So,
θ1 = θc.
However, we also know that the angle of refraction at the critical angle is 90◦. So we have:
θ2 = 90
◦.
We can then write Snell's Law as:
n1 sin θc = n2 sin 90
◦
Solving for θc gives:
n1 sin θc = n2 sin 90

sin θc = (1)

Important: Take care that for total internal reflection the incident ray is always in the
denser medium.
