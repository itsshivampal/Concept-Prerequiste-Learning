3.3 Displacement and Distance

Definition: Displacement

Displacement is the change in an object's position.

The displacement of an object is defined as its change in position (final position minus initial

position). Displacement has a magnitude and direction and is therefore a vector. For example,

if the initial position of a car is xi and it moves to a final position of xf , then the displacement

is:

xf − xi

However, subtracting an initial quantity from a final quantity happens often in Physics, so we

use the shortcut ∆ to mean final - initial. Therefore, displacement can be written:

∆x = xf − xi

Important: The symbol ∆ is read out as delta. ∆ is a letter of the Greek alphabet and is

used in Mathematics and Science to indicate a change in a certain quantity, or a final value

minus an initial value. For example, ∆x means change in x while ∆t means change in t.

Important: The words initial and final will be used very often in Physics. Initial will always

refer to something that happened earlier in time and final will always refer to something

that happened later in time. It will often happen that the final value is smaller than the

initial value, such that the difference is negative. This is ok!

Figure 3.4: Illustration of displacement

Displacement does not depend on the path travelled, but only on the initial and final positions

(Figure 3.4). We use the word distance to describe how far an object travels along a particular

path. Distance is the actual distance that was covered. Distance (symbol d) does not have a

direction, so it is a scalar. Displacement is the shortest distance from the starting point to the

endpoint - from the school to the shop in the figure. Displacement has direction and is therefore

a vector.

Figure 3.2.2 shows the five houses we discussed earlier. Jack walks to school, but instead of

walking straight to school, he decided to walk to his friend Joel's house first to fetch him so that

they can walk to school together. Jack covers a distance of 400 m to Joel's house and another

500 m to school. He covers a distance of 900 m. His displacement, however, is only 100 m

towards the school. This is because displacement only looks at the starting position (his house)

and the end position (the school). It does not depend on the path he travelled.

To calculate his distance and displacement, we need to choose a reference point and a direction.

Let's choose Jack's house as the reference point, and towards Joel's house as the positive direc-

tion (which means that towards the school is negative). We would do the calculations as follows:

Distance(d) = path travelled Displacement(∆x) = xf − xi

= 400 m+ 500 m = −100 m + 0 m

= 900 m = −100 m

Joel walks to school with Jack and after school walks back home. What is Joel's displacement

and what distance did he cover? For this calculation we use Joel's house as the reference point.

Let's take towards the school as the positive direction.

Distance(d) = path travelled Displacement(∆x) = xf − xi

= 500 m+ 500 m = 0 m+ 0 m

= 1000 m = 0 m

It is possible to have a displacement of 0 m and a distance that is not 0 m. This happens

when an object completes a round trip back to its original position, like an athlete running

around a track.
