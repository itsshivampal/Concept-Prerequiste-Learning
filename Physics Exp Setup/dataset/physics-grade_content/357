21.5.2 What is a frame of reference?

Definition: Frame of Reference

A frame of reference is the point of view from which a system is observed.

In practical terms, a frame of reference is a set of axes (specifying directions) with an origin.

An observer can then measure the position and motion of all points in a system, as well as the

orientation of objects in the system relative to the frame of reference.

There are two types of reference frames: inertial and non-inertial. An inertial frame of

reference travels at a constant velocity, which means that Newton's first law (inertia) holds

true. A non-inertial frame of reference, such as a moving car or a rotating carousel, accelerates.

Therefore, Newton's first law does not hold true in a non-inertial reference frame, as objects

appear to accelerate without the appropriate forces.
