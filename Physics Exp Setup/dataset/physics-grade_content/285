17.3.1 Electric field lines

The maps depend very much on the charge or charges that the map is being made for. We will

start off with the simplest possible case. Take a single positive charge with no other charges

around it. First, we will look at what effects it would have on a test charge at a number of

points.

Electric field lines, like the magnetic field lines that were studied in Grade 10, are a way of

representing the electric field at a point.

• Arrows on the field lines indicate the direction of the field, i.e. the direction a positive

test charge would move.

• Electric field lines therefore point away from positive charges and towards negative

charges.

• Field lines are drawn closer together where the field is stronger.
