29.5.1 Logic Gates

There are five main types of logic gate: NOT, AND, OR, NAND and NOR. Each one makes its

decision in a different way.

The NOT Gate

Problem: You want an automatic circuit in your office to turn on the heating in the winter.

You already have a digital electronic temperature sensor. When the temperature is high, it

sends out a 1. When the office is cold, it sends out a 0. If this signal were sent straight to the

heater, the heater would turn on (1) when it was already hot, and would stay off when it was

cold. This is wrong! To make the heater work, we need a circuit which will change a 0 (from

the sensor) into a 1 (to send to the heater). This will make the heater come on when it is cold.

You also want it to change a 1 (from the sensor) into a 0 (to send to the heater). This will

turn the heater off when the room is hot. This circuit is called an inverter or NOT gate. It

changes 0 into 1 (1 is NOT 0). It changes 1 into 0 (0 is NOT 1). It changes a signal into what

it is NOT.

The symbol for the NOT gate is:

The action of the NOT gate is written in a table called a truth table. The left column shows

the possible inputs on different rows. The right column shows what the output (decision) of

the circuit will be for that input. The truth table for the NOT gate is shown below.

Input Output

0 1

1 0

When you read the truth table, the top row says, "If the input is 0, the output will be 1." For

our heater, this means, "If the room is cold, the heater will turn on." The bottom row says, "If

the input is 1, the output will be 0." For our heater, this means, "If the room is hot, the heater

will switch off."

The AND Gate

Problem: An airliner has two toilets. Passengers get annoyed if they get up from their seat

only to find that both toilets are being used and they have to go back to their seat and wait.

You want to fit an automatic circuit to light up a display if both toilets are in use. Then

passengers know that if the light is off, there will be a free toilet for them to use. There is a

sensor in each toilet. It gives out a 0 of the toilet is free, and a 1 if it is in use. You want to

send a 1 to the display unit if both sensors are sending 1s. To do this, you use an AND gate.

The symbol for the AND gate is:

Figure 29.17: Symbol for the AND logic gate.

The truth table for the AND gate is shown below. An AND gate has two inputs (the NOT gate

only had one). This means we need four rows in the truth table, one for each possible set of

inputs. The first row, for example, tells us what the AND gate will do if both inputs are 0. In

our airliner, this means that both toilets are free. The right column has a 0 showing that the

output will be 0, so the display will not light up. The second row has inputs of 0 and 1 (the

first toilet is free, the other is in use). Again the output is 0. The third row tells us what will

happen if the inputs are 1 and 0 (the first toilet is in use, and the second is free). Finally, the

last line tells us what will happen if both inputs are 1 (both toilets are in use). It is only in this

case that the output is 1 and the display lights up.

changes 0 into 1 (1 is NOT 0). It changes 1 into 0 (0 is NOT 1). It changes a signal into what
it is NOT.

the input is 1, the output will be 0." For our heater, this means, "If the room is hot, the heater

The AND Gate

only to find that both toilets are being used and they have to go back to their seat and wait.
You want to fit an automatic circuit to light up a display if both toilets are in use. Then
passengers know that if the light is off, there will be a free toilet for them to use. There is a
sensor in each toilet. It gives out a 0 of the toilet is free, and a 1 if it is in use. You want to
send a 1 to the display unit if both sensors are sending 1s. To do this, you use an AND gate.

This device is called an AND gate, because the output is only 1 if one input AND the other
input are both 1.
Extension: Using 0 and 1 to mean True and False
When we use logic gates we use the low voltage state 0 to represent ‘false'.
The high voltage state 1 represents ‘true'. This is why the word AND is so
appropriate. A AND B is true (1) if, and only if, A is true (1) AND B is true (1).
Extension: AND and multiplication
Sometimes, the AND operation is written as multiplication. A AND B is
written AB. If either A or B are 0, then AB will also be 0. For AB to be 1, we need
A and B to both be 1. Multiplication of the numbers 0 and 1 does exactly the
same job as an AND gate.
The NAND Gate
Problem: You build the circuit for the airliner toilets using an AND gate. Your customer is
pleased, but she says that it would be better if the display lit up when there was a free toilet.
In other words, the display should light up unless both toilets are in use. To do this we want a
circuit which does the opposite of an AND gate. We want a circuit which would give the
output 0 if an AND gate would give 1. We want a circuit which would give the output 1 if an
AND gate would give 0. This circuit is called a NAND gate.
The symbol for the NAND gate is:
The truth table for the NAND gate is shown below.
Inputs Output
A B
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 0
You may have noticed that we could have done this job on the airliner by using our earlier
circuit, with a NOT gate added between the original AND gate and the display. This is where
the word NAND comes from - it is short for NotAND.
The OR Gate
Problem: A long, dark corridor has two light switches - one at each end of the corridor. The
switches each send an output of 0 to the control unit if no-one has pressed the switch. If
someone presses the switch, its output is 1. The lights in the corridor should come on if either
switch is pressed. To do this job, the control unit needs an OR gate. The symbol for the OR
gate is:
612
CHAPTER 29. ELECTRONICS - GRADE 12 29.5
The truth table for the OR gate is shown.
Inputs Output
A B
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
You can see that the output is 1 (and the lights come on in the corridor) if either one switch
OR the other is pressed. Pressing both switches also turns on the lights, as the last row in the
table shows.
Extension: OR and addition
Sometimes you will see A OR B written mathematically as A+B. This makes
sense, since if A=0 and B=0, then A OR B = A+B = 0. Similarly, if A=0 and
B=1, then A OR B = A+B = 1. If A=1 and B=0, then A OR B = A+B = 1
once again. The only case where the OR function differs from normal addition is
when A=1 and B=1. Here A OR B = 1 in logic, but A+B=2 in arithmetic.
However, there is no such thing as ‘2' in logic, so we define + to mean ‘OR', and
write 1+1=1 with impunity!
If you wish, you can prove that the normal rules of algebra still work using this
notation: A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C, A(BC) = (AB)C, and A(B+C) = AB + AC.
This special kind of algebra where variables can only be 0 (representing false) or 1
(representing true) is called Boolean algebra.
The NOR Gate
The last gate you need to know is the NOR gate. This is opposite to the OR gate. The output
is 1 if both inputs are 0. In other words, the output switches on if neither the first NOR the
second input is 1. The symbol for the NOR gate is:
The truth table for the NOR gate is shown below.
Inputs Output

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 0

29.5 CHAPTER 29. ELECTRONICS - GRADE 12
The examples given were easy. Each job only needed one logic gate. However any ‘decision
making' circuit can be built with logic gates, no matter how complicated the decision. Here is
an example.
Worked Example 181: An Economic Heating Control
Question: A sensor in a building detects whether a room is being used. If it is
empty, the output is 0, if it is in use, the output is 1. Another sensor measures the
temperature of the room. If it is cold, the output is 0. If it is hot, the output is 1.
The heating comes on if it receives a 1. Design a control circuit so that the heating
only comes on if the room is in use and it is cold.
Answer
The first sensor tells us whether the room is occupied. The second sensor tells us
whether the room is hot. The heating must come on if the room is occupied AND
cold. This means that the heating should come on if the room is occupied AND
(NOT hot). To build the circuit, we first attach a NOT gate to the output of the
temperature sensor. This output of the NOT gate will be 1 only if the room is
cold. We then attach this output to an AND gate, together with the output from
the other sensor. The output of the AND gate will only be 1 if the room is
occupied AND the output of the NOT gate is also 1. So the heating will only come
on if the room is in use and is cold. The circuit is shown below.
Hot
Output
Occupied
Worked Example 182: Solving a circuit with two logic gates
Question: Compile the truth table for the circuit below.
Answer
Firstly, we label the inputs A and B. We also label the point where the two gates
are connected C.
B
C Output
A
Next we prepare a truth table. There is a column for each of the inputs, for the
intermediate point C and also for the output. The truth table has four rows, since
there are four possible inputs - 00, 01, 10 and 11.
614
CHAPTER 29. ELECTRONICS - GRADE 12 29.5
A B C Output
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
Next we fill in the C column given that we know what a NOR gate does.
A B C Output
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 0
Next, we can fill in the output, since it will always be the opposite of C (because of
the NOT gate).
A B C Output
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
Finally we see that this combination of gates does the same job as an OR gate.
Each logic gate is manufactured from two or more transistors. Other circuits can be made
using logic gates, as we shall see in the next section. We shall show you how to count and
store numbers using logic gates. This means that if you have enough transistors, and you
connect them correctly to make the right logic gates, you can make circuits which count and
store numbers.
In practice, the cheapest gate to manufacture is usually the NAND gate. Additionally, Charles
Peirce showed that NAND gates alone (as well as NOR gates alone) can be used to reproduce
all the other logic gates.
