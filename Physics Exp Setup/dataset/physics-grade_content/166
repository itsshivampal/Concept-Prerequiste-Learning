11.2 Scalars and Vectors

In Mathematics, you learned that a number is something that represents a quantity. For example

if you have 5 books, 6 apples and 1 bicycle, the 5, 6, and 1 represent how many of each item

you have.

These kinds of numbers are known as scalars.

Definition: Scalar

A scalar is a quantity that has only magnitude (size).

An extension to a scalar is a vector, which is a scalar with a direction. For example, if you travel

1 km down Main Road to school, the quantity 1 km down Main Road is a vector. The 1 km

is the quantity (or scalar) and the down Main Road gives a direction.

In Physics we use the word magnitude to refer to the scalar part of the vector.

Definition: Vectors

A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

A vector should tell you how much and which way.

For example, a man is driving his car east along a freeway at 100 km·hr−1. What we have given

here is a vector - the velocity. The car is moving at 100 km·hr−1(this is the magnitude) and we

know where it is going - east (this is the direction). Thus, we know the speed and direction of

the car. These two quantities, a magnitude and a direction, form a vector we call velocity.
