8.2 Magnetic fields

A magnetic field is a region in space where a magnet or object made of ferromagnetic material

will experience a non-contact force.

Electrons moving inside any object have magnetic fields associated with them. In most materials

these fields point in all directions, so the net magnetic field is zero. For example, in the plastic ball

below, the directions of the magnetic fields of the electrons (shown by the arrows) are pointing

in different directions and cancel each other out. Therefore the plastic ball is not magnetic and

has no magnetic field.

The electron magnetic fields point in all directions

and so there is no net magnetic field

8.2 CHAPTER 8. MAGNETISM - GRADE 10

In some materials (e.g. iron), called ferromagnetic materials, there are regions called domains,

where these magnetic fields line up. All the atoms in each domain group together so that the

magnetic fields from their electrons point the same way. The picture shows a piece of an iron

needle zoomed in to show the domains with the electric fields lined up inside them.

in each domain the electron magnetic fields (black arrows)

are pointing in the same direction, causing a net

magnetic field (big white arrows) in each domain

In permanent magnets, many domains are lined up, resulting in a net magnetic field. Objects

made from ferromagnetic materials can be magnetised, for example by rubbing a magnet along

the object in one direction. This causes the magnetic fields of most, or all, of the domains to line

up and cause the object to have a magnetic field and be magnetic. Once a ferromagnetic object

has been magnetised, it can stay magnetic without another magnet being nearby (i.e. without

being in another magnetic field). In the picture below, the needle has been magnetised because

the magnetic fields in all the domains are pointing in the same direction.

when the needle is magnetised, the magnetic fields

of all the domains (white arrows) point in the

same direction, causing a net magnetic field

Activity :: Investigation : Ferromagnetic materials and magnetisation

1. Find 2 paper clips. Put the paper clips close together and observe what hap-

pens.

1.1 What happens to the paper clips?

1.2 Are the paper clips magnetic?

2. Now take a permanent bar magnet and rub it once along 1 of the paper clips.

Remove the magnet and put the paper clip which was touched by the magnet

close to the other paper clip and observe what happens.

2.1 Does the untouched paper clip feel a force on it? If so, is the force

attractive or repulsive?

3. Rub the same paper clip a few more times with the bar magnet, in the same

direction as before. Put the paper clip close to the other one and observe what

happens.

3.1 Is there any difference to what happened in step 2?

3.2 If there is a difference, what is the reason for it?

3.3 Is the paper clip which was rubbed by the magnet now magnetised?

3.4 What is the difference between the two paper clips at the level of

their atoms and electrons?

4. Now, find a metal knitting needle, or a plastic ruler, or other plastic object.

Rub the bar magnet along the knitting needle a few times in the same direction.

Now put the knitting needle close to the paper clips and observe what happens.

4.1 Does the knitting needle attract the paper clips?

4.2 What does this tell you about the material of the knitting needle?

Is it ferromagnetic?

5. Repeat this experiment with objects made from other materials.

5.1 Which materials appear to be ferromagnetic and which are not? Put

your answers in a table.
