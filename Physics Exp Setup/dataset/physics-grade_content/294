17.5.2 Dielectrics

The electric field between the plates of a capacitor is affected by the substance between them.

The substance between the plates is called a dielectric. Common substances used as dielectrics

are mica, perspex, air, paper and glass.

When a dielectric is inserted between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor the dielectric

becomes polarised so an electric field is induced in the dielectric that opposes the field between

the plates. When the two electric fields are superposed, the new field between the plates

becomes smaller. Thus the voltage between the plates decreases so the capacitance increases.

In every capacitor, the dielectric keeps the charge on one plate from travelling to the other

plate. However, each capacitor is different in how much charge it allows to build up on the

electrodes per voltage applied. When scientists started studying capacitors they discovered the

property that the voltage applied to the capacitor was proportional to the maximum charge

that would accumulate on the electrodes. The constant that made this relation into an

equation was called the capacitance, C. The capacitance was different for different capacitors.

But, it stayed constant no matter how much voltage was applied. So, it predicts how much

charge will be stored on a capacitor when different voltages are applied.
