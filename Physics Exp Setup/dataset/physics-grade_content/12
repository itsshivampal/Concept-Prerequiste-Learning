2.5.4 Significant Figures

In a number, each non-zero digit is a significant figure. Zeroes are only counted if they are

between two non-zero digits or are at the end of the decimal part. For example, the number

2000 has 1 significant figure (the 2), but 2000,0 has 5 significant figures. You estimate a number

like this by removing significant figures from the number (starting from the right) until you have

the desired number of significant figures, rounding as you go. For example 6,827 has 4 significant

figures, but if you wish to write it to 3 significant figures it would mean removing the 7 and

rounding up, so it would be 6,83.
