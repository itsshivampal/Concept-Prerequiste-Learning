13.3.1 Structure of the Eye

Eyesight begins with lenses. As light rays enter your eye, they pass first through the cornea and

then through the crystalline lens. These form a double lens system and focus light rays onto

the back wall of the eye, called the retina. Rods and cones are nerve cells on the retina that

transform light into electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerve.

A cross-section of the eye is shown in Figure 13.14.

For clear vision, the image must be formed right on the retina, not in front of or behind it. To

accomplish this, you may need a long or short focal length, depending on the object distance.

How do we get the exact right focal length we need? Remember that the lens system has two

parts. The cornea is fixed in place but the crystalline lens is flexible - it can change shape.

When the shape of the lens changes, its focal length also changes. You have muscles in your eye

called ciliary muscles that control the shape of the crystalline lens. When you focus your gaze

on something, you are squeezing (or relaxing) these muscles. This process of accommodation

changes the focal length of the lens and allows you to see an image clearly.

The lens in the eye creates a real image that is smaller than the object and is inverted

(Figure 13.15).

5. Place the lamp so it is shining through the hole in the black cardboard.

6. Make the room as dark as possible.

7. Move the white cardboard until an image of the light bulb or candle appears

on it.

You now have a working model of the human eye.

1. The hole in the black cardboard represents the pupil. The pupil is a small hole

in the front of the eyeball that lets light into the eye.

2. The round bowl of water represents the eyeball.

3. The white cardboard represents the retina. Images are projected onto the retina

and are then sent to the brain via the optic nerve.

Tasks

1. Is the image on the retina right-side up or upside down? Explain why.

2. Draw a simple labelled diagram of the model of the eye showing which part of

the eye each part of the model represents.
