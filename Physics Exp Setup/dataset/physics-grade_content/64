5.4.1 Motion of a Particle of the Medium

First we consider the motion of a particle of the medium when a pulse moves through the

medium. For the explanation we will zoom into the medium so that we are looking at the atoms

of the medium. These atoms are connected to each other as shown in Figure 5.2.

Figure 5.2: Particles in a medium.

When a pulse moves through the medium, the particles in the medium only move up and down.

We can see this in the figure below which shows the motion of a single particle as a pulse moves

through the medium.

Important: A particle in the medium only moves up and down when a transverse pulse

moves through the medium. The pulse moves from left to right (or right to left). The

motion of the particle is perpendicular to the motion of a transverse pulse.

If you consider the motion of the particle as a function of time, you can draw a graph of position

vs. time and velocity vs. time.

Activity :: Investigation : Drawing a position-time graph

1. Study Figure ?? and complete the following table:

2. Use your table to draw a graph of position vs. time for a particle in a medium.

The position vs. time graph for a particle in a medium when a pulse passes through the medium

is shown in Figure 5.3
