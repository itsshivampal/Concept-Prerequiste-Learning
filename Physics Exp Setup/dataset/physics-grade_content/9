2.5.1 Rounding Off

Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is

that impossible, but writing numbers out to a high accuracy (many decimal places) is very

inconvenient and rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number to a

certain number of decimal places. Rounding off or approximating a decimal number to a given

number of decimal places is the quickest way to approximate a number. For example, if you

wanted to round-off 2,6525272 to three decimal places then you would first count three places

after the decimal.

2,652|5272

All numbers to the right of | are ignored after you determine whether the number in the third

decimal place must be rounded up or rounded down. You round up the final digit (make the

digit one more) if the first digit after the | was greater or equal to 5 and round down (leave the

digit alone) otherwise. So, since the first digit after the | is a 5, we must round up the digit in

the third decimal place to a 3 and the final answer of 2,6525272 rounded to three decimal places

is 2,653.

Worked Example 1: Rounding-off

Question: Round-off π = 3,141592654 . . . to 4 decimal places.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine the last digit that is kept and mark the cut-off with |.

π = 3,1415|92654 . . .

Step 2 : Determine whether the last digit is rounded up or down.

The last digit of π = 3,1415|92654 . . .must be rounded up because there is a 9 after

the |.

Step 3 : Write the final answer.

π = 3,1416 rounded to 4 decimal places.

Worked Example 2: Rounding-off

Question: Round-off 9,191919 . . . to 2 decimal places

Answer

Step 1 : Determine the last digit that is kept and mark the cut-off with |.

9,19|1919 . . .

Step 2 : Determine whether the last digit is rounded up or down.

The last digit of 9,19|1919 . . . must be rounded down because there is a 1 after

the |.

Step 3 : Write the final answer.

Answer = 9,19 rounded to 2 decimal places.

2.4 Combinations of SI Base Units

To make working with units easier, some combinations of the base units are given special names,

but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 2.2 lists some examples

of combinations of SI base units that are assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the

formulae look unfamiliar at this stage - we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as

well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to recognise the units correctly. For instance, the new-

ton (N) is another name for the kilogram metre per second squared (kg·m·s−2), while the

kilogram metre squared per second squared (kg·m2 ·s−2) is called the joule (J).

Table 2.2: Some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned special names

Important: When writing combinations of base SI units, place a dot (·) between the units

to indicate that different base units are used. For example, the symbol for metres per second

is correctly written as m·s−1, and not as ms−1 or m/s.
