20.2.1 Metals

Metals are good conductors because they have unfilled space in the valence energy band. In

the absence of an electric field, there are electrons traveling in all directions. When an electric

field is applied the mobile electrons flow. Electrons in this band can be accelerated by the

electric field because there are plenty of nearby unfilled states in the band.
