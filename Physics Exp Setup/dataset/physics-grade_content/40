3.11 Summary

• A reference point is a point from where you take your measurements.

• A frame of reference is a reference point with a set of directions.

• Your position is where you are located with respect to your reference point.

• The displacement of an object is how far it is from the reference point. It is the shortest

distance between the object and the reference point. It has magnitude and direction

because it is a vector.

• The distance of an object is the length of the path travelled from the starting point to the

end point. It has magnitude only because it is a scalar.

• A vector is a physical quantity with magnitude and direction.

• A scalar is a physical quantity with magnitude only.

• Speed (s) is the distance covered (d) divided by the time taken (∆t):

d

s =

∆t

• Average velocity (v) is the displacement (∆x) divided by the time taken (∆t):

∆x

v =

∆t

• Instantaneous speed is the speed at a specific instant in time.

• Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific instant in time.

• Acceleration (a) is the change in velocity (∆x) over a time interval (∆t):

∆v

a =

∆t

• The gradient of a position - time graph (x vs. t) give the velocity.

• The gradient of a velocity - time graph (v vs. t) give the acceleration.

• The area under a velocity - time graph (v vs. t) give the displacement.

• The area under an acceleration - time graph (a vs. t) gives the velocity.

• The graphs of motion are summarised in figure 3.10.

• The equations of motion are used where constant acceleration takes place:

vf = vi + at

(vi + vf )

∆x = t
