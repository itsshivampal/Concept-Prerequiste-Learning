9.2 Two kinds of charge

All objects surrounding us (including people!) contain large amounts of electric charge. There

are two types of electric charge: positive charge and negative charge. If the same amounts

of negative and positive charge are brought together, they neutralise each other and there is

no net charge. Neutral objects are objects which contain positive and negative charges, but in

equal numbers. However, if there is a little bit more of one type of charge than the other on the

object then the object is said to be electrically charged. The picture below shows what the

distribution of charges might look like for a neutral, positively charged and negatively charged

object.

There are:

6 positive charges and 8 positive charges and 6 positive charges and

6 negative charges 6 negative charges 9 negative charges

6 + (-6) = 0 8 + (-6) = 2 6 + (-9) = -3

There is zero net charge: The net charge is +2 The net charge is -3

The object is neutral The object is positively charged The object is negatively charged
