13.4 Gravitational Lenses

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts that light that passes close to very heavy objects

like galaxies, black holes and massive stars will be bent. These massive objects therefore act as

a kind of lens that is known as a gravitational lens. Gravitational lenses distort and change the

apparent position of the image of stars.

If a heavy object is acting as a gravitational lens, then an observer from Earth will see many

images of a distant star (Figure 13.19).
