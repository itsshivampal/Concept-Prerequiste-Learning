22.5 Summary

1. Hooke's Law gives the relationship between the extension of a spring and the force

applied to it. The law says they are proportional.

2. Materials can be classified as plastic or elastic depending on how they respond to an

applied force.

3. Materials can fracture or undergo creep or fatigue when forces are applied to them.

4. Materials have the following mechanical properties to a greater or lesser degree: strength,

hardness, ductility, malleability, brittleness, stiffness.

5. Materials can be weakened by have the following problems in their crystal lattice:

vacancies, dislocations, impurities, difference in grain size.

6. Materials can have their mechanical properties improved by one or more of the following

processes: cold working, annealing, adding impurities, tempering, sintering.
