13.7 Summary

1. A lens is any transparent material that is shaped in such a way that it will converge

parallel incident rays to a point or diverge incident rays from a point.

2. Converging lenses are thicker in the middle than on the edge and will bend incoming light

rays towards the principal axis.

3. Diverging lenses are thinner in the middle than on the edge and will bend incoming light

rays away from the principal axis.

4. The principal axis of a lens is the horizontal line through the centre of the lens.

5. The centre of the lens is called the optical centre.

6. The focus or focal point is a point on the principal axis where parallel rays converge

through or diverge from.

7. The focal length is the distance between the focus and the optical centre.

8. Ray diagrams are used to determine the position and height of an image formed by a

lens. The properties of images formed by converging and diverging lenses are summarised

in Table 13.1.

9. The human eye consists of a lens system that focuses images on the retina where the

optic nerve transfers the messages to the brain.

10. Defects of vision are short-sightedness, long-sightedness and astigmatism.

11. Massive bodies act as gravitational lenses that change the apparent positions of the

images of stars.

12. Microscopes and telescopes use systems of lenses to create visible images of different

objects.
