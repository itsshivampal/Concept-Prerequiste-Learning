18.1 Introduction

Electromagnetism is the science of the properties and relationship between electric currents and

magnetism. An electric current creates a magnetic field and a moving magnetic field will create

a flow of charge. This relationship between electricity and magnetism has resulted in the

invention of many devices which are useful to humans.
