5.4 Graphs of Position and Velocity

When a pulse moves through a medium, there are two different motions: the motion of the

particles of the medium and the motion of the pulse. These two motions are at right angles to

each other when the pulse is transverse. Each motion will be discussed.

Consider the situation shown in Figure ??. The dot represents one particle of the medium. We

see that as the pulse moves to the right the particle only moves up and down.
