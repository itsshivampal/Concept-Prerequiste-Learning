26.6 Shock Waves and Sonic Booms

Now we know that the waves move away from the source at the speed of sound. What

happens if the source moves at the same time as emitting sounds? Once a sound wave has

been emitted it is no longer connected to the source so if the source moves it doesn't change

the way the sound wave is propagating through the medium. This means a source can actually

catch up with a sound waves it has emitted.

The speed of sound is very fast in air, about 340 m · s−1, so if we want to talk about a source

catching up to sound waves then the source has to be able to move very fast. A good source of

sound waves to discuss is a jet aircraft. Fighter jets can move very fast and they are very noisy

so they are a good source of sound for our discussion. Here are the speeds for a selection of

aircraft that can fly faster than the speed of sound.

sin θ = 0.211867782

θ = sin−1 0.211867782

θ = 12.2o

The first minimum is at 12.2 degrees from the centre peak.

From the formula you can see that a smaller wavelength for the same slit results in a smaller

angle to the interference minimum. This is something you just saw in the two worked

examples. Do a sanity check, go back and see if the answer makes sense. Ask yourself which

light had the longer wavelength, which light had the larger angle and what do you expect for

longer wavelengths from the formula.

Worked Example 172: Diffraction Minimum III

Question: A slit has a width which is unknown and has green light of wavelength

532 nm impinge on it. The diffracted light interferers on a surface, and the first

minimum is measure at an angle of 20.77 degrees?

Answer

Step 1 : Check what you are given

We know that we are dealing with interference patterns from the diffraction of light

passing through a slit. We know that the wavelength of the light is 532 nm which

is 532× 10−9 m. We know the angle to first minimum so we know that m = 1 and

θ = 20.77o.

Step 2 : Applicable principles

We know that there is a relationship between the slit width, wavelength and

interference minimum angles:

mλ

sin θ =

a

We can use this relationship to find the width by substituting what we know and

solving for the width.

Step 3 : Substitution

532× 10−9

sin θ =

a

532× 10−9

sin 20.77 =

a

532× 10−9

a =

0.354666667

a = 1500× 10−9

a = 1500 nm

The slit width is 1500 nm.
