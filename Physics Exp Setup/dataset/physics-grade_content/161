10.5.3 Ohmmeter

An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical resistance. The basic ohmmeter can

function much like an ammeter. The ohmmeter works by suppling a constant voltage to the

resistor and measuring the current flowing through it. The measured current is then converted

into a corresponding resistance reading through Ohm's Law. Ohmmeters only function correctly

when measuring resistance that is not being powered by a voltage or current source. In other

words, you cannot measure the resistance of a component that is already connected to a circuit.

This is because the ohmmeter's accurate indication depends only on its own source of voltage.

The presence of any other voltage across the measured circuit component interferes with the

ohmmeter's operation. Figure 10.5 shows an ohmmeter connected with a resistor.

10.5 Instruments to Measure voltage, current and resis-

tance

As we have seen in previous sections, an electric circuit is made up of a number of different

components such as batteries, resistors and light bulbs. There are devices to measure the

properties of these components. These devices are called meters.

For example, one may be interested in measuring the amount of current flowing through a circuit

using an ammeter or measuring the voltage provided by a battery using a voltmeter. In this

section we will discuss the practical usage of voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters.

10.5.1 Voltmeter

A voltmeter is an instrument for measuring the voltage between two points in an electric circuit.

In analogy with a water circuit, a voltmeter is like a meter designed to measure pressure difference.

Since one is interested in measuring the voltage between two points in a circuit, a voltmeter

must be connected in parallel with the portion of the circuit on which the measurement is made.

Figure 10.3 shows a voltmeter connected in parallel with a battery. One lead of the voltmeter is

connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end. The

voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of

a circuit that has a voltage drop.

10.5.2 Ammeter

An ammeter is an instrument used to measure the flow of electric current in a circuit. Since one

is interested in measuring the current flowing through a circuit component, the ammeter must

be connected in series with the measured circuit component (Figure 10.4).

10.5.3 Ohmmeter

An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical resistance. The basic ohmmeter can

function much like an ammeter. The ohmmeter works by suppling a constant voltage to the

resistor and measuring the current flowing through it. The measured current is then converted

into a corresponding resistance reading through Ohm's Law. Ohmmeters only function correctly
