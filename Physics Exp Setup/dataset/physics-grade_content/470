30.6.3 X-rays

While x-rays are used significantly in medicine, prolonged exposure to X-rays can lead to cell

damage and cancer.

For example, a mammogram is an x-ray of the human breast to detect breast cancer, but if a

woman starts having regular mammograms when she is too young, her chances of getting

breast cancer increases.
