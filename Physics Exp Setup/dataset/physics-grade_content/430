28.2 Electrical machines - generators and motors

We have seen that when a conductor is moved in a magnetic field or when a magnet is moved

near a conductor, such that the magnetic field is not parallel to the conductor, a current flows

in the conductor. The amount of current depends on the speed at which the conductor

experiences a changing magnetic field, the number of turns of the conductor and the

orientation of the plane of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field. The effect of the

orientation of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field is shown in Figure 28.1.

Figure 28.1: Series of figures showing that the magnetic flux through a conductor is dependent

on the angle that the plane of the conductor makes with the magnetic field. The greatest flux

passes through the conductor when the plane of the conductor is perpendicular to the magnetic

field lines as in (a). The number of field lines passing through the conductor decreases, as the

conductor rotates until it is parallel to the magnetic field.

If the current flowing in the conductor were plotted as a function of the angle between the

plane of the conductor and the magnetic field, then the current would vary as shown in

Figure 28.2. The current alternates about the zero value and is also known as an alternating

current (abbreviated AC).

28.1 Introduction

In Grade 11 you learnt how a magnetic field is generated around a current carrying conductor.

You also learnt how a current is generated in a conductor that moves in a magnetic field. This

chapter describes how conductors moved in a magnetic field are applied in the real-world.
