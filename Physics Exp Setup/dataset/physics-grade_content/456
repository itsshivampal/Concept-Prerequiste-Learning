29.6 Using and Storing Binary Numbers

In the previous section, we saw how the numbers 0 and 1 could represent ‘false' and ‘true' and

could be used in decision making. Often we want to program a computer to count with

numbers. To do this we need a way of writing any number using nothing other than 0 and 1.

When written in this way, numbers are called binary numbers.
