3.2.1 Frames of Reference

Definition: Frame of Reference

A frame of reference is a reference point combined with a set of directions.

A frame of reference is similar to the idea of a reference point. A frame of reference is defined

as a reference point combined with a set of directions. For example, a boy is standing still inside

a train as it pulls out of a station. You are standing on the platform watching the train move

from left to right. To you it looks as if the boy is moving from left to right, because relative

to where you are standing (the platform), he is moving. According to the boy, and his frame of

reference (the train), he is not moving.

From your frame of reference the boy is moving from left to right.

Figure 3.1: Frames of Reference

A frame of reference must have an origin (where you are standing on the platform) and at least

a positive direction. The train was moving from left to right, making to your right positive and

to your left negative. If someone else was looking at the same boy, his frame of reference will

be different. For example, if he was standing on the other side of the platform, the boy will be

moving from right to left.

For this chapter, we will only use frames of reference in the x-direction. Frames of reference will

be covered in more detail in Grade 12.
