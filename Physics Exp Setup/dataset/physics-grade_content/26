3.3.1 Interpreting Direction

Very often in calculations you will get a negative answer. For example, Jack's displacement in

the example above, is calculated as -100 m. The minus sign in front of the answer means that

his displacement is 100 m in the opposite direction (opposite to the direction chosen as positive

in the beginning of the question). When we start a calculation we choose a frame of reference

and a positive direction. In the first example above, the reference point is Jack's house and the

positive direction is towards Joel's house. Therefore Jack's displacement is 100 m towards the

school. Notice that distance has no direction, but displacement has.
