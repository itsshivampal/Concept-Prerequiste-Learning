26.4 Interference

Interference occurs when two identical waves pass through the same region of space at the

same time resulting in a superposition of waves. There are two types of interference which is of

interest: constructive interference and destructive interference.

Constructive interference occurs when both waves have a displacement in the same direction,

while destructive interference occurs when one wave has a displacement in the opposite

direction to the other, thereby resulting in a cancellation. There is no displacement of the

medium in destructive interference while for constructive interference the displacement of the

medium is greater than the individual displacements.

Constructive interference occurs when both waves have a displacement in the same direction,

this means they both have a peak or they both have a trough at the same place at the same

time. If they both have a peak then the peaks add together to form a bigger peak. If they both

have a trough then the trough gets deeper.

Destructive interference occurs when one wave has a displacement in the opposite direction to

the other, this means that the one wave has a peak and the other wave has a trough. If the

waves have identical magnitudes then the peak "fills" up the trough and the medium will look

like there are no waves at that point. There will be no displacement of the medium. A place

where destructive interference takes places is called a node.

Waves can interfere at places where there is never a trough and trough or peak and peak or

trough and peak at the same time. At these places the waves will add together and the

resultant displacement will be the sum of the two waves but they won't be points of maximum

interference.

Consider the two identical waves shown in the picture below. The wavefronts of the peaks are

shown as black lines while the wavefronts of the troughs are shown as grey lines. You can see

that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the

same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add

together to form a bigger peak.

Two points sources (A and B) radiate identical waves. The wavefronts of the peaks (black

lines) and troughs (grey lines) are shown. Constructive interference occurs where two black

lines intersect or where two gray lines intersect. Destructive interference occurs where a black

line intersects with a grey line.

You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks

are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two

peaks add together to form a bigger peak.

When the grey lines cross other grey lines there are two troughs are in the same place at the

same time so we will have constructive interference where the two troughs add together to

form a bigger trough.

In the case where a grey line crosses a black line we are seeing a trough and peak in the same

place. These will cancel each other out and the medium will have no displacement at that

point.

• black line + black line = peak + peak = constructive interference

• grey line + grey line = trough + trough = constructive interference

• black line + grey line = grey line + black line = peak + trough = trough + peak =

destructive interference

On half the picture below, we have marked the constructive interference with a solid black

diamond and the destructive interference with a hollow diamond.

To see if you understand it, cover up the half we have marked with diamonds and try to work

out which points are constructive and destructive on the other half of the picture. The two

halves are mirror images of each other so you can check yourself.
