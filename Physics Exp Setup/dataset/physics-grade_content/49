4.4 Kinetic Energy

Definition: Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion.

Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion. This means that any moving

object has kinetic energy. The faster it moves, the more kinetic energy it has. Kinetic energy

(KE) is therefore dependent on the velocity of the object. The mass of the object also plays a

role. A truck of 2000 kg, moving at 100 km·hr−1, will have more kinetic energy than a car of

500 kg, also moving at 100 km·hr−1. Kinetic energy is defined as:

1

KE = mv2 (4.6)

Consider the 1 kg suitcase on the cupboard that was discussed earlier. When the suitcase falls, it

will gain velocity (fall faster), until it reaches the ground with a maximum velocity. The suitcase

will not have any kinetic energy when it is on top of the cupboard because it is not moving.

Once it starts to fall it will gain kinetic energy, because it gains velocity. Its kinetic energy will

increase until it is a maximum when the suitcase reaches the ground.

The kinetic energy is a minimum.

KE = 12mv

2 = 0 J

The kinetic energy is a maximum.

KE = 12mv

2 = 19,6 J

Worked Example 18: Calculation of Kinetic Energy

Question: A 1 kg brick falls off a 4 m high roof. It reaches the ground with a

velocity of 8,85 m·s−1. What is the kinetic energy of the brick when it starts to fall

and when it reaches the ground?

Answer

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

• The mass of the rock m = 1 kg

• The velocity of the rock at the bottom vbottom = 8,85 m·s−1

These are both in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

We are asked to find the kinetic energy of the brick at the top and the bottom.

From the definition we know that to work out KE, we need to know the mass and

the velocity of the object and we are given both of these values.

Step 3 : Calculate the kinetic energy at the top

Since the brick is not moving at the top, its kinetic energy is zero.

Step 4 : Substitute and calculate the kinetic energy

1

KE = mv2

= (1 kg)(8,85 m · s−1)2

= 39,2 J
