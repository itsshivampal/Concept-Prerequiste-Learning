4.4.1 Checking units

According to the equation for kinetic energy, the unit should be kg·m2 ·s−2. We can prove that

this unit is equal to the joule, the unit for energy.

(kg)(m · s−1)2 = (kg ·m · s−2) ·m

= N · m (because Force (N) = mass (kg) × acceleration (m·s−2))

= J (Work (J) = Force (N) × distance (m))

We can do the same to prove that the unit for potential energy is equal to the joule:

(kg)(m · s−2)(m) = N · m

= J

Worked Example 19: Mixing Units & Energy Calculations

Question: A bullet, having a mass of 150 g, is shot with a muzzle velocity of

960 m·s−1. Calculate its kinetic energy?

Answer

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

• We are given the mass of the bullet m = 150 g. This is not the unit we want

mass to be in. We need to convert to kg.

Mass in grams÷ 1000 = Mass in kg

150 g ÷ 1000 = 0,150 kg

• We are given the initial velocity with which the bullet leaves the barrel, called

the muzzle velocity, and it is v = 960 m·s−1.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

• We are asked to find the kinetic energy.

Step 3 : Substitute and calculate

We just substitute the mass and velocity (which are known) into the equation for

kinetic energy:

1

KE = mv2

1

= (150)(960)2

2

= 69 120 J

Exercise: Kinetic Energy

1. Describe the relationship between an object's kinetic energy and its:

(a) mass and

(b) velocity

2. A stone with a mass of 100 g is thrown up into the air. It has an initial velocity

of 3 m·s−1. Calculate its kinetic energy

(a) as it leaves the thrower's hand.

(b) when it reaches its turning point.
