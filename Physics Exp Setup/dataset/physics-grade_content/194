12.2.5 Free Body Diagrams

In a free-body diagram, the object of interest is drawn as a dot and all the forces acting on it

are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot. A free body diagram for the two-trailer-system

will therefore look like this:

CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.2

• All arrows must have labels. Use letters with a key on the side if you do not have enough

space on your drawing.

• The labels must indicate what is applying the force (the force of the car?) on what the

force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which direction (to the right)

• If the values of the forces are known, these values can be added to the diagram or key.
