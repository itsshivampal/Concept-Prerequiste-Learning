17.7 Summary

1. Objects can be positively, negatively charged or neutral.

2. Charged objects feel a force with a magnitude:

Q1Q2

F = k

r2

3. The force is attractive for unlike charges and repulsive for like charges.

4. A test charge is +1C

5. Electric fields start on positive charges and end on negative charges

6. The electric field is constant between equally charged parallel plates

7. A charge in an electric field, just like a mass under gravity, has potential energy which is

related to the work to move it.

8. A capacitor is a device that stores charge in a circuit.
