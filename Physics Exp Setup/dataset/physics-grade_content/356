Figure 21.8: Top view of a road with two people standing on opposite sides. A car drives past.

Consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a road. A car drives past

them, heading West. For the person facing South, the car was moving toward the right.

However, for the person facing North, the car was moving toward the left. This discrepancy is

due to the fact that the two people used two different frames of reference from which to

investigate this system. If each person were asked in what direction the car were moving, they

would give a different answer. The answer would be relative to their frame of reference.

subatomic collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the forces at work

and also about the sub-structure of such systems.

The experiments are in the category of "high energy physics" (also known as

"subatomic" physics). The primary tool of scientific exploration in these

experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very, very small

subatomic objects such as nuclei. As a general rule, the higher the energy of the

collisions, the more detail of the original system you are able to resolve. These

experiments are operated at laboratories such as CERN, SLAC, BNL, and Fermilab,

just to name a few. The giant machines that perform the collisions are roughly the

size of towns. For example, the RHIC collider at BNL is a ring about 1 km in

diameter and can be seen from space. The newest machine currently being built,

the LHC at CERN, is a ring 9 km in diameter!

Questions:

1. What are isotopes? (2)

2. What are atoms made up of? (3)

3. Why do you think protons are used in the experiments and not atoms like

carbon? (2)

4. Why do you think it is necessary to find out what atoms are made up of and

how they behave during collisions? (2)

5. Two protons (mass 1,67× 10−27 kg) collide and somehow stick together after

the collision. If each proton travelled with an initial velocity of

5,00× 107 m · s−1 and they collided at an angle of 90◦, what is the velocity of

the combination after the collision. (9)
