13.5.2 Reflecting Telescopes

Some telescopes use mirrors as well as lenses and are called reflecting telescopes. Specifically,

a reflecting telescope uses a convex lens and two mirrors to make an object appear larger.

(Figure 13.21.)

Light is collected by the primary mirror, which is large and concave. Parallel rays traveling toward

this mirror are reflected and focused to a point. The secondary plane mirror is placed within the

focal length of the primary mirror. This changes the direction of the light. A final eyepiece lens

diverges the rays so that they are parallel when they reach your eye.
