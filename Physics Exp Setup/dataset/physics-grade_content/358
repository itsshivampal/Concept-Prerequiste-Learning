21.5.3 Why are frames of reference important?

Frames of reference are important because (as we have seen in the introductory example) the

velocity of a car can differ depending on which frame of reference is used.

Extension: Frames of Reference and Special Relativity

Frames of reference are especially important in special relativity, because when

a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light,

then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another reference

frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between

moving frames of reference.

The next worked example will explain this.
