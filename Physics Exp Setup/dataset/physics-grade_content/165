11.1 Introduction

This chapter focuses on vectors. We will learn what is a vector, how it differs from everyday

numbers, how to add, subtract and multiply them and where they appear in Physics.

Are vectors Physics? No, vectors themselves are not Physics. Physics is just a description of

the world around us. To describe something we need to use a language. The most common

language used to describe Physics is Mathematics. Vectors form a very important part of the

mathematical description of Physics, so much so that it is absolutely essential to master the use

of vectors.
