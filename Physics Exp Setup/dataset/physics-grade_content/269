Ships on the ocean make use of the reflecting properties of sound waves to determine the

depth of the ocean. A sound wave is transmitted and bounces off the seabed. Because the

speed of sound is known and the time lapse between sending and receiving the sound can be

measured, the distance from the ship to the bottom of the ocean can be determined, This is

called sonar, which stands from Sound Navigation And Ranging.
