18.2.1 Real-world applications

Electromagnets

An electromagnet is a piece of wire intended to generate a magnetic field with the passage of

electric current through it. Though all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields, an

electromagnet is usually constructed in such a way as to maximize the strength of the magnetic

field it produces for a special purpose. Electromagnets find frequent application in research,

industry, medical, and consumer products.

As an electrically-controllable magnet, electromagnets find application in a wide variety of

"electromechanical" devices: machines that effect mechanical force or motion through

electrical power. Perhaps the most obvious example of such a machine is the electric motor

which will be described in detail in Grade 12. Other examples of the use of electromagnets are

electric bells, relays, loudspeakers and scrapyard cranes.

Activity :: Experiment : Electromagnets

Aim:

A magnetic field is created when an electric current flows through a wire. A single

wire does not produce a strong magnetic field, but a coiled wire around an iron

core does. We will investigate this behaviour.

Apparatus:

1. a battery and holder

2. a length of wire

3. a compass

4. a few nails

5. a few paper clips

Method:

1. Bend the wire into a series of coils before attaching it to the battery. Observe

what happens to the deflection on the compass. Has the deflection of the

compass grown stronger?

2. Repeat the experiment by changing the number and size of the coils in the

wire. Observe what happens to the deflection on the compass.

3. Coil the wire around an iron nail and then attach the coil to the battery.

Observe what happens to the deflection on the compass.

Conclusions:

1. Does the number of coils affect the strength of the magnetic field?

2. Does the iron nail increase or decrease the strength of the magnetic field?

Exercise: Magnetic Fields

1. Give evidence for the existence of a magnetic field near a current carrying wire.
