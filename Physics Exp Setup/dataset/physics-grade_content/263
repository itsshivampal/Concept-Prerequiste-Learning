15.2.2 Loudness

The amplitude of a sound wave determines its loudness or volume. A larger amplitude means a

louder sound, and a smaller amplitude means a softer sound. In Figure 15.1 sound C is louder

than sound B. The vibration of a source sets the amplitude of a wave. It transmits energy into

the medium through its vibration. More energetic vibration corresponds to larger amplitude.

The molecules move back and forth more vigorously.

The loudness of a sound is also determined by the sensitivity of the ear. The human ear is more

sensitive to some frequencies than to others. Loudness thus depends on both the amplitude of

a sound wave and its frequency whether it lies in a region where the ear is more or less sensitive.
