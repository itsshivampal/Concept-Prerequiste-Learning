4.7 Summary

• Mass is the amount of matter an object is made up of.

• Weight is the force with which the Earth attracts a body towards its centre.

• A body is in free fall if it is moving in the Earth's gravitational field and no other forces

act on it.

• The equations of motion can be used for free fall problems. The acceleration (a) is equal

to the acceleration due to gravity (g).

• The potential energy of an object is the energy the object has due to his position above a

reference point.

• The kinetic energy of an object is the energy the object has due to its motion.

• Mechanical energy of an object is the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy of

the object.

• The unit for energy is the joule (J).

The potential energy is a maximum at the top.

The kinetic energy is zero at the top.

The mechanical energy will remain constant

throughout the motion and will always be a maximum.

The potential energy is zero at the bottom.

The kinetic energy is a maximum at the bottom

• Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy is zero at the start of the fall. When the suitcase

reaches the ground, the kinetic energy is a miximum. We also use distance on the x-axis.

KE (J)

0 distance (m) 2

• Mechanical energy: The mechanical energy is constant throughout the motion and is

always a maximum. At any point in time, when we add the potential energy and the

kinetic energy, we will get the same number.
