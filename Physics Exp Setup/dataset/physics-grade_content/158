10.5 Instruments to Measure voltage, current and resis-

tance

As we have seen in previous sections, an electric circuit is made up of a number of different

components such as batteries, resistors and light bulbs. There are devices to measure the

properties of these components. These devices are called meters.

For example, one may be interested in measuring the amount of current flowing through a circuit

using an ammeter or measuring the voltage provided by a battery using a voltmeter. In this

section we will discuss the practical usage of voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters.
