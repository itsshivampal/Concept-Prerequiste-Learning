6.2.4 Period and Frequency

Imagine you are sitting next to a pond and you watch the waves going past you. First one peak

arrives, then a trough, and then another peak. Suppose you measure the time taken between

one peak arriving and then the next. This time will be the same for any two successive peaks

passing you. We call this time the period, and it is a characteristic of the wave.

The symbol T is used to represent the period. The period is measured in seconds (s).

Definition: The period (T) is the time taken for two successive peaks (or troughs)

to pass a fixed point.

Imagine the pond again. Just as a peak passes you, you start your stopwatch and count each

peak going past. After 1 second you stop the clock and stop counting. The number of peaks

that you have counted in the 1 second is the frequency of the wave.

Definition: The frequency is the number of successive peaks (or troughs) passing a

given point in 1 second.

The frequency and the period are related to each other. As the period is the time taken for

1 peak to pass, then the number of peaks passing the point in 1 second is 1 . But this is the

T

frequency. So

f =

CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10 6.2

For example, if a wave takes 12 s to go by then the period of the wave is

1

2 s. Therefore, the

frequency of the wave is:

f =

T

= 1

2 s

= 2 s−1

The unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz) or s−1.

Worked Example 27: Period and Frequency

Question: What is the period of a wave of frequency 10Hz?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

We are required to calculate the period of a 10Hz wave.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

= 0,1m

Step 4 : Write the answer

The period of a 10Hz wave is 0,1m.

6.2 CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10

In the activity the distance between the indicated points was the same. These points are then

said to be in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an integer (0,1,2,3,...) number of

complete wave cycles. They do not have to be peaks or troughs, but they must be separated by

a complete number of wavelengths.

We then have an alternate definition of the wavelength as the distance between any two adjacent

points which are in phase.

Definition: Wavelength of wave

The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two adjacent points that are in phase.

Points that are not in phase, those that are not separated by a complete number of wavelengths,

are called out of phase. Examples of points like these would be A and C, or D and E, or B and

H in the Activity.
