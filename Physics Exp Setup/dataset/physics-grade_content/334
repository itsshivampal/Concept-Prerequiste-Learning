20.3 Intrinsic Properties and Doping

We have seen that the size of the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction

band determines whether a solid is a conductor or an insulator. However, we have seen that

there is a material known as a semi-conductor. A semi-conductor is a solid whose band gap is

smaller than that of an insulator and whose electrical properties can be modified by a process

known as doping.

Definition: Doping

Doping is the deliberate addition of impurities to a pure semiconductor material to change

its electrical properties.

Semiconductors are often the Group IV elements in the periodic table. The most common

semiconductor elements are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The most important property of

Group IV elements is that they 4 valence electrons.

Extension: Band Gaps of Si and Ge

Si has a band gap of 1.744× 10−19 J while Ge has a band gap of

1.152× 10−19 J.

Figure 20.1: Arrangement of atoms in a Si crystal.

So, if we look at the arrangement of for example Si atoms in a crystal, they would look like

that shown in Figure 20.1.

The main aim of doping is to make sure there are either too many (surplus) or too few

electrons (deficiency). Depending on what situation you want to create you use different

elements for the doping.

20.2.3 Semi-conductors

A semi-conductor is very similar to an insulator. The main difference between semiconductors

and insulators is the size of the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. The

band gap in insulators is larger than the band gap in semiconductors.

In semi-conductors at room temperature, just as in insulators, very few electrons gain enough

thermal energy to leap the band gap, which is necessary for conduction. For this reason, pure

semi-conductors and insulators, in the absence of applied fields, have roughly similar electrical

properties. The smaller band gaps of semi-conductors, however, allow for many other means

besides temperature to control their electrical properties. The most important one being that

for a certain amount of applied voltage, more current will flow in the semiconductor than in the

insulator.

Exercise: Conduction

1. Explain how energy levels of electrons in an atom combine with those of other

atoms in the formation of crystals.

2. Explain how the resulting energy levels are more closely spaced than those in

the individual atoms, forming energy bands.

3. Explain the existence of energy bands in metal crystals as the result of

superposition of energy levels.

4. Explain and contrast the conductivity of conductors, semi-conductors and

insulators using energy band theory.

5. What is the main difference in the energy arrangement between an isolated

atom and the atom in a solid?

6. What determines whether a solid is an insulator, a semiconductor, or a

conductor?
