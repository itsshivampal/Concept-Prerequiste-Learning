24.4 Summary

1. The Doppler Effect is the apparent change in frequency and wavelength of a wave when

the observer and source of the wave move relative to each other.

2. The following equation can be used to calculate the frequency of the wave according to

the observer or listener:

v ± vL

fL = f

v ∓ SvS

3. If the direction of the wave from the listener to the source is chosen as positive, the

velocities have the following signs.

Source moves towards listener vS : negative

Source moves away from listener vS : positive

Listener moves towards source vL : positive

Listener moves away from source vL : negative

4. The Doppler Effect can be observed in all types of waves, including ultrasound, light and

radiowaves.

5. Sonography makes use of ultrasound and the Doppler Effect to determine the direction of

blood flow.

6. Light is emitted by stars. Due to the Doppler Effect, the frequency of this light decreases

and the starts appear red. This is called a red shift and means that the stars are moving

away from the Earth. This means that the Universe is expanding.
