30.6.4 Gamma-rays

Due to the high energy of gamma-rays, they are able to cause serious damage when absorbed

by living cells.

Gamma-rays are not stopped by the skin and can induce DNA alteration by interfering with the

genetic material of the cell. DNA double-strand breaks are generally accepted to be the most

biologically significant lesion by which ionising radiation causes cancer and hereditary disease.

A study done on Russian nuclear workers exposed to external whole-body gamma-radiation at

high cumulative doses shows a link between radiation exposure and death from leukaemia,

lung, liver, skeletal and other solid cancers.

Extension: Cellphones and electromagnetic radiation

Cellphone radiation and health concerns have been raised, especially following

the enormous increase in the use of wireless mobile telephony throughout the

world. This is because mobile phones use electromagnetic waves in the microwave

range. These concerns have induced a large body of research. Concerns about

effects on health have also been raised regarding other digital wireless systems,

such as data communication networks.

The World Health Organization has officially ruled out adverse health effects

from cellular base stations and wireless data networks, and expects to make

recommendations about mobile phones in 2007-08.

Cellphone users are recommended to minimise radiation, by for example:

1. Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head.

2. Keep the mobile phone away from the body.

3. Do not telephone in a car without an external antenna.

30.6.2 Ultraviolet radiation and the eyes

High intensities of UVB light are hazardous to the eyes, and exposure can cause welder's flash

(photo keratitis or arc eye) and may lead to cataracts, pterygium and pinguecula formation.

Protective eyewear is beneficial to those who are working with or those who might be exposed

to ultraviolet radiation, particularly short wave UV. Given that light may reach the eye from the

sides, full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure,

as in high altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of

UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from

snow and ice.

Ordinary, untreated eyeglasses give some protection. Most plastic lenses give more protection

than glass lenses. Some plastic lens materials, such as polycarbonate, block most UV. There

are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it which will give better

protection. But even a treatment that completely blocks UV will not protect the eye from light

that arrives around the lens. To convince yourself of the potential dangers of stray UV light,

cover your lenses with something opaque, like aluminum foil, stand next to a bright light, and

consider how much light you see, despite the complete blockage of the lenses. Most contact

lenses help to protect the retina by absorbing UV radiation.

30.6.3 X-rays

While x-rays are used significantly in medicine, prolonged exposure to X-rays can lead to cell

damage and cancer.

For example, a mammogram is an x-ray of the human breast to detect breast cancer, but if a

woman starts having regular mammograms when she is too young, her chances of getting

breast cancer increases.

by living cells.
