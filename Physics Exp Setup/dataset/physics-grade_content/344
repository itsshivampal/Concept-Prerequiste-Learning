Chapter 21

Motion in Two Dimensions -

Grade 12

21.1 Introduction

In Chapter 3, we studied motion in one dimension and briefly looked at vertical motion. In this

chapter we will discuss vertical motion and also look at motion in two dimensions. In

Chapter 12, we studied the conservation of momentum and looked at applications in one

dimension. In this chapter we will look at momentum in two dimensions.

21.2 Vertical Projectile Motion

In Chapter 4, we studied the motion of objects in free fall and we saw that an object in free fall

falls with gravitational acceleration g. Now we can consider the motion of objects that are

thrown upwards and then fall back to the Earth. We call this projectile motion and we will only

consider the situation where the object is thrown straight upwards and then falls straight

downwards - this means that there is no horizontal displacement of the object, only a vertical

displacement.

21.2.1 Motion in a Gravitational Field

When an object is in a gravitational field, it always accelerates downwards with a constant

acceleration g whether the object is moving upward or downward. This is shown in Figure 21.1.

Important: Projectiles moving upwards or downwards always accelerate downwards with a

constant acceleration g.

Figure 21.1: Objects moving upwards or downwards, always accelerate downwards.

This means that if an object is moving upwards, it decreases until it stops (vf = 0 m·s−1).

This is the maximum height that the object reaches, because after this, the object starts to fall.

Important: Projectiles have zero velocity at their greatest height.
