12.3 Newton's Laws

In grade 10 you learned about motion, but did not look at how things start to move. You have

also learned about forces. In this section we will look at the effect of forces on objects and how

we can make things move.

Step 2 : Draw the free body diagram for the trailer.

The question only asks for horizontal forces. We will therefore not include the force

of the Earth on the trailer, or the force of the road on the trailer as these forces are

in a vertical direction.

F1: Force of car on trailer (to the right) (2000 N)

b

Ff : Frictional force on trailer (to the left) (200 N)

Step 3 : Determine the resultant force on the trailer.

To find the resultant force we need to add all the horizontal forces together. We do

not add vertical forces as the movement of the car and trailer will be in a horizontal

direction, and not up and down. FR = 2000 + (-200) = 1800 N to the right.

12.2.7 Exercise

1. A force acts on an object. Name three effects that the force can have on the object.

2. Identify each of the following forces as contact or non-contact forces.

2.1 The force between the north pole of a magnet and a paper clip.

2.2 The force required to open the door of a taxi.

2.3 The force required to stop a soccer ball.

2.4 The force causing a ball, dropped from a height of 2 m, to fall to the floor.

3. A book of mass 2 kg is lying on a table. Draw a labeled force diagram indicating all the

forces on the book.

4. A boy pushes a shopping trolley (mass 15 kg) with a constant force of 75 N. A constant

frictional force of 20 N is present.

4.1 Draw a labeled force diagram to identify all the forces acting on the shopping trolley.

4.2 Draw a free body diagram of all the horizontal forces acting on the trolley.

4.3 Determine the resultant force on the trolley.

5. A donkey (mass 250 kg) is trying to pull a cart (mass 80 kg) with a force of 400 N. The

rope between the donkey and the cart makes an angle of 30â—¦ with the cart. The cart does

not move.

5.1 Draw a free body diagram of all the forces acting on the donkey.

5.2 Draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the cart.

5.3 Find the magnitude and direction of the frictional force preventing the cart from

moving.
