25.4.3 Pigment primary colours

The primary pigments and paints are cyan, magenta and yellow. When pigments or paints of

these three colours are mixed together in equal amounts they produce black. Any other colour

of paint can be made by mixing the primary pigments together in different quantities. The

primary pigments are related to the primary colours of light in the following way:

PRIMARY PIGMENTS

cyan+magenta + yellow = black

PRIMARY PIGMENTS PRIMARY

COLOURS

OF LIGHT

cyan+magenta = blue

cyan+ yellow = green

magenta + yellow = red

Itneterreessttinigng Colour printers only use 4 colours of ink: cyan, magenta, yellow and black. All

FFacctt the other colours can be mixed from these!

Worked Example 166: Pigments

Question: What colours of light are absorbed by a green pigment?

Answer

If the pigment is green, then green light must be reflected. Therefore, red and blue

light are absorbed.

Worked Example 167: Primary pigments

Question: I have a ruler which reflects red light and absorbs all other colours of

light. What colour does the ruler appear in white light? What primary pigments

must have been mixed to make the pigment which gives the ruler its colour?

Answer

Step 1 : What is being asked and what are we given?

We need to determine the colour of the ruler and the pigments which were mixed

to make the colour.

Step 2 : An opaque object appears the colour of the light it reflects

The ruler reflects red light and absorbs all other colours. Therefore the ruler

appears to be red.

Step 3 : What pigments need to be mixed to get red?

Red pigment is produced when magenta and yellow pigments are mixed. Therefore

magenta and yellow pigments were mixed to make the red pigment which gives the

ruler its colour.

Worked Example 168: Paint Colours

Question: If cyan light shines on a dress that contains a pigment that is capable

of absorbing blue, what colour does the dress appear?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine the component colours of cyan light

Cyan light is made up of blue and green light.

Step 2 : Determine solution

If the dress absorbs the blue light then the green light must be reflected, so the

dress will appear green!

CHAPTER 25. COLOUR - GRADE 12 25.4

Worked Example 165: Colour of Transparent Objects

Question: If white light is shone through a glass plate that absorbs light of all

frequencies except red, what is the colour of the glass plate?

Answer

Since the colour of an object is determined by that frequency of light that is

transmitted, the glass plate will appear red, as this is the only frequency that is not

absorbed.
