19.3.3 Batteries and internal resistance

Real batteries are made from materials which have resistance. This means that real batteries

are not just sources of potential difference (voltage), but they also possess internal resistances.

If the pure voltage source is referred to as the emf, E , then a real battery can be represented as

an emf connected in series with a resistor r. The internal resistance of the battery is

represented by the symbol r.

Definition: Load

The external resistance in the circuit is referred to as the load.

Suppose that the battery (or cell) with emf E and internal resistance r supplies a current I

through an external load resistor R. Then the voltage drop across the load resistor is that

supplied by the battery:

V = I · R

Similarly, from Ohm's Law, the voltage drop across the internal resistance is:

Vr = I · r

The voltage V of the battery is related to its emf E and internal resistance r by:

E = V + Ir; or

V = E − Ir

The emf of a battery is essentially constant because it only depends on the chemical reaction

(that converts chemical energy into electrical energy) going on inside the battery. Therefore,

we can see that the voltage across the terminals of the battery is dependent on the current

drawn by the load. The higher the current, the lower the voltage across the terminals, because

the emf is constant. By the same reasoning, the voltage only equals the emf when the current

is very small.

The maximum current that can be drawn from a battery is limited by a critical value Ic. At a

current of Ic, V =0 V. Then, the equation becomes:

0 = E − Icr

Icr = E

Ic =

The maximum current that can be drawn from a battery is less than Er .

Question: What is the internal resistance of a battery if its emf is 12 V and the

voltage drop across its terminals is 10 V when a current of 4 A flows in the circuit

when it is connected across a load?
