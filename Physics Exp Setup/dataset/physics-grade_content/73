6.1 Introduction

Waves occur frequently in nature. The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in

the ocean, or in a bucket. We are most interested in the properties that waves have. All waves

have the same properties, so if we study waves in water, then we can transfer our knowledge to

predict how other examples of waves will behave.
