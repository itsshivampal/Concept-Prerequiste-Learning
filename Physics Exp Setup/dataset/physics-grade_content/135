9.6.1 The electroscope

The electroscope is a very sensitive instrument which can be used to detect electric charge. A

diagram of a gold leaf electroscope is shown the figure below. The electroscope consists of a

glass container with a metal rod inside which has 2 thin pieces of gold foil attached. The other

end of the metal rod has a metal plate attached to it outside the glass container.

The electroscope detects charge in the following way: A charged object, like the positively

charged rod in the picture, is brought close to (but not touching) the neutral metal plate of

the electroscope. This causes negative charge in the gold foil, metal rod, and metal plate, to

be attracted to the positive rod. Because the metal (gold is a metal too!) is a conductor, the

charge can move freely from the foil up the metal rod and onto the metal plate. There is now

more negative charge on the plate and more positive charge on the gold foil leaves. This is

called inducing a charge on the metal plate. It is important to remember that the electroscope

is still neutral (the total positive and negative charges are the same), the charges have just been

induced to move to different parts of the instrument! The induced positive charge on the gold

leaves forces them apart since like charges repel! This is how we can tell that the rod is charged.

If the rod is now moved away from the metal plate, the charge in the electroscope will spread

itself out evenly again and the leaves will fall down again because there will no longer be an

induced charge on them.

Grounding

If you were to bring the charged rod close to the uncharged electroscope, and then you touched

the metal plate with your finger at the same time, this would cause charge to flow up from the

ground (the earth), through your body onto the metal plate. This is called grounding. The

charge flowing onto the plate is opposite to the charge on the rod, since it is attracted to the

rod. Therefore, for our picture, the charge flowing onto the plate would be negative. Now

charge has been added to the electroscope. It is no longer neutral, but has an excess of negative

charge. Now if we move the rod away, the leaves will remain apart because they have an excess

of negative charge and they repel each other.

happens to the charge on each sphere and what the final charge on each sphere is

after they are moved apart.

Step 2 : What concept is being used?

We know that the charge carriers in conductors are free to move around and that

charge on a conductor spreads itself out on the surface of the conductor.

Step 3 : Use the concept to find the answer

1. When the two conducting spheres are brought together to touch, it is as though

they become one single big conductor and the total charge of the two spheres

spreads out across the whole surface of the touching spheres. When the spheres

are moved apart again, each one is left with half of the total original charge.

2. Before the spheres touch, the total charge is: -5 nC + (-3) nC = -8 nC. When

they touch they share out the -8 nC across their whole surface. When they are

removed from each other, each is left with half of the original charge:

−8 nC /2 = −4 nC

on each sphere.
