18.6 Summary

1. Electromagnetism is the study of the properties and relationship between electric current

and magnetism.

2. A current carrying conductor will produce a magnetic field around the conductor.

3. The direction of the magnetic field is found by using the Right Hand Rule.

4. Electromagnets are temporary magnets formed by current-carrying conductors.

5. Electromagnetic induction occurs when a moving magnetic field induces a voltage in a

current-carrying conductor.

6. Transformers use electromagnetic induction to alter the voltage.

7. A charged particle will experience a force in a magnetic field.
