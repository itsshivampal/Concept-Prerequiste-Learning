12.4.2 Comparative Problems

Comparative problems involve calculation of something in terms of something else that we know.

For example, if you weigh 490 N on Earth and the gravitational acceleration on Venus is 0,903

that of the gravitational acceleration on the Earth, then you would weigh 0,903 x 490 N = 442,5 N

on Venus.

Principles for answering comparative problems

• Write out equations and calculate all quantities for the given situation

• Write out all relationships between variable from first and second case

• Write out second case

• Substitute all first case variables into second case

• Write second case in terms of first case

Worked Example 83: Comparative Problem 1

Question: On Earth a man has a mass of 70 kg. The planet Zirgon is the same

size as the Earth but has twice the mass of the Earth. What would the man weigh

on Zirgon, if the gravitational acceleration on Earth is 9,8 m·s−2?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what information has been given

The following has been provided:

• the mass of the man on Earth, m

• the mass of the planet Zirgon (mZ) in terms of the mass of the Earth (mE),

mZ = 2mE

• the radius of the planet Zirgon (rZ) in terms of the radius of the Earth (rE),

rZ = rE

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We are required to determine the man's weight on Zirgon (wZ). We can do this by

using:

m1 ·m2

w = mg = G

r2

to calculate the weight of the man on Earth and then use this value to determine

the weight of the man on Zirgon.

Step 3 : Situation on Earth

mE ·m

wE = mgE = G

r2E

= (70 kg)(9,8m · s−2)

= 686N

Step 4 : Situation on Zirgon in terms of situation on Earth

Write the equation for the gravitational force on Zirgon and then substitute the

values for mZ and rZ , in terms of the values for the Earth.

r2E

mE ·m

Step 5 : Quote the final answer

The man weighs 1 372 N on Zirgon.

Question: On Earth a man weighs 70 kg. On the planet Beeble how much will he

weigh if Beeble has mass half of that of the Earth and a radius one quarter that of

the Earth. Gravitational acceleration on Earth is 9,8 m·s−2.

Answer
