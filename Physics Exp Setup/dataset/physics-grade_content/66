5.5 Transmission and Reflection of a Pulse at a Boundary

What happens when a pulse travelling in one medium finds that medium is joined to another?

Activity :: Investigation : Two ropes

Find two different ropes and tie both ropes together. Hold the joined ropes

horizontally and create a pulse by flicking the rope up and down. What happens to

the pulse when it encounters the join?

When a pulse meets a boundary between two media, part of the pulse is reflected and part of it

is transmitted. You will see that in the thin rope the pulse moves back (is reflected). The pulse

is also passed on (transmitted) to the thick rope and it moves away from the boundary.

Figure 5.6: Reflection and transmission of a pulse at the boundary between two media.

When a pulse is transmitted from one medium to another, like from a thin rope to a thicker one,

the pulse will change where it meets the boundary of the two mediums (for example where the

ropes are joined). When a pulse moves from a thin rope to a thicker one, the speed of the pulse

will decrease. The pulse will move slower and the pulse length will increase.

When a pulse moves from a thick rope to a thinner one, the opposite happens. The pulse speed

will increase and the pulse length will decrease.

When the speed of the pulse increases, the pulse length will decrease. If the speed decreases,

the pulse length will increase. The incident pulse is the one that arrives at the boundary. The

reflected pulse is the one that moves back, away from the boundary. The transmitted pulse

is the one that moves into the new medium, away from the boundary.

Exercise: Pulses at a Boundary I

1. Fill in the blanks or select the correct answer: A pulse in a heavy rope is

traveling towards the boundary with a thin piece of string.

(a) The reflected pulse in the heavy rope will/will not be inverted because

.

(b) The speed of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the speed of the incident pulse.

(c) The speed of the reflected pulse will be greater than/less than/the same

as the speed of the incident pulse.

(d) The pulse length of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the pulse length of the incident pulse.

(e) The frequency of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the frequency of the incident pulse.

2. A pulse in a light string is traveling towards the boundary with a heavy rope.

(a) The reflected pulse in the light rope will/will not be inverted because

.

(b) The speed of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the speed of the incident pulse.

(c) The speed of the reflected pulse will be greater than/less than/the same

as the speed of the incident pulse.

(d) The pulse length of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the pulse length of the incident pulse.
