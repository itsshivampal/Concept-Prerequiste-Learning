7.4.1 Refractive Index

Which is easier to travel through, air or water? People usually travel faster through air. So

does light! The speed of light and therefore the degree of bending of the light depends on the

refractive index of material through which the light passes. The refractive index (symbol n) is

the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in the material. You can think of the

refractive index as a measure of how difficult it is for light to get through a material.

Definition: Refractive Index

The refractive index of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed

in the medium.

c = 299 792 485m · s−1

For purposes of calculation, we use 3 × 108 m · s−1. A vacuum is a region with

no matter in it, not even air. However, the speed of light in air is very close to

that in a vacuum.

Definition: Refractive Index

The refractive index (symbol n) of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum

to its speed in the material and gives an indication of how difficult it is for light to get

through the material.

where

n = refractive index (no unit)

c = speed of light in a vacuum (3,00× 108 m · s−1)

v = speed of light in a given medium (m · s−1)

Extension: Refractive Index and Speed of Light

Using

c

n =

v

we can also examine how the speed of light changes in different media, because the

speed of light in a vacuum (c) is constant.

If the refractive index n increases, the speed of light in the material v must

decrease. Light therefore travels slowly through materials of high n.

Table 7.4.1 shows refractive indices for various materials. Light travels slower in any material

than it does in a vacuum, so all values for n are greater than 1.
