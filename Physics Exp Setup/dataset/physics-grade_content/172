11.4.2 Compass Directions N

Another common method of expressing direc-

tions is to use the points of a compass: North, W E

South, East, and West.

S

If a vector does not point exactly in one

of the compass directions, then we use an angle.

For example, we can have a vector pointing 40◦

North of West. Start with the vector pointing

along the West direction:

Then rotate the vector towards the north

until there is a 40◦ angle between the vector

and the West.

The direction of this vector can also be described

40◦

as: W 40◦ N (West 40◦ North); or N 50◦ W

(North 50◦ West)
