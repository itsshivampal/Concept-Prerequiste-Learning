2.5.2 Error Margins

In a calculation that has many steps, it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end. For

example, Jack and Jill walks to school. They walk 0,9 kilometers to get to school and it takes

them 17 minutes. We can calculate their speed in the following two ways.

Method 1 Method 2

Change 17 minutes to hours: Change 17 minutes to hours:

time = 1760 time =

= 0,283333333 km = 0,28 km

Table 2.3: Rounding numbers

You will see that we get two different answers. In Method 1 no rounding was done, but in Method

2, the time was rounded to 2 decimal places. This made a big difference to the answer. The

answer in Method 1 is more accurate because rounded numbers were not used in the calculation.

Always only round off your final answer.
