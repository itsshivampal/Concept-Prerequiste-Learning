15.2.1 Pitch

The frequency of a sound wave is what your ear understands as pitch. A higher frequency

sound has a higher pitch, and a lower frequency sound has a lower pitch. In Figure 15.1 sound

A has a higher pitch than sound B. For instance, the chirp of a bird would have a high pitch,

but the roar of a lion would have a low pitch.

The human ear can detect a wide range of frequencies. Frequencies from 20 to 20 000 Hz are

audible to the human ear. Any sound with a frequency below 20 Hz is known as an infrasound

and any sound with a frequency above 20 000 Hz is known as an ultrasound.

Table 15.1 lists the ranges of some common animals compared to humans.

Table 15.1: Range of frequencies

lower frequency (Hz) upper frequency (Hz)

Humans 20 20 000

Dogs 50 45 000

Cats 45 85 000

Bats 120 000

Dolphins 200 000

Elephants 5 10 000

Activity :: Investigation : Range of Wavelengths

Using the information given in Table 15.1, calculate the lower and upper

wavelengths that each species can hear. Assume the speed of sound in air is

344 m·s−1.
