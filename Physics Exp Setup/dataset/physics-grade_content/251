14.3.2 Wavelength and Amplitude

Definition: Wavelength

The wavelength in a longitudinal wave is the distance between two consecutive points that

are in phase.

The wavelength in a longitudinal wave refers to the distance between two consecutive

compressions or between two consecutive rarefactions.

Definition: Amplitude

The amplitude is the maximum displacement from a position of rest.

The amplitude is the distance from the equilibrium position of the medium to a compression or

a rarefaction.
