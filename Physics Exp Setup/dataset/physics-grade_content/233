13.2.2 Diverging Lenses

We will only discuss double concave diverging lenses as shown in Figure 13.11. Concave lenses

are thicker on the outside and thinner on the inside.

Figure 13.11: A double concave lens is a diverging lens.

Figure 13.12 shows a concave lens with light rays travelling through it. You can see that concave

lenses have the opposite curvature to convex lenses. This causes light rays passing through a

concave lens to diverge or be spread out away from the principal axis. For this reason, concave

lenses are called diverging lenses. Images formed by concave lenses are always virtual.

Unlike converging lenses, the type of images created by a concave lens is not dependent on the

position of the object. The image is always upright, smaller than the object, and located closer

to the lens than the object.

We examine the properties of the image by drawing ray diagrams. We can find the image by

tracing the path of three light rays through the lens. Any two of these rays will show us the

Drawing Ray Diagrams for Diverging Lenses
Draw the three rays starting at the top of the object.
1. Ray R1 travels parallel to the principal axis. The ray bends and lines up with a focal
point. However, the concave lens is a diverging lens, so the ray must line up with the focal
point on the same side of the lens where light rays enter it. This means that we must
project an imaginary line backwards through that focal point (F1) (shown by the dashed
line extending from R1).
2. Ray R2 points towards the focal point F2 on the opposite side of the lens. When it hits
the lens, it is bent parallel to the principal axis.
3. Ray R3 passes through the optical center of the lens. Like for the convex lens, this ray
passes through with its direction unchanged.
4. We find the image by locating the point where the rays meet. Since the rays diverge,
they will only meet if projected backward to a point on the same side of the lens as the
object. This is why concave lenses always have virtual images. (Since the light rays do
not actually meet at the image, the image cannot be real.)
Figure 13.13 shows an object placed at an arbitrary distance from the diverging lens.
We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays for a diverging lens.
Figure 13.13 shows that the image of an object is upright. The image is called a virtual image
because it is on the same side of the lens as the object.
The image is smaller than the object and is closer to the lens than the object.

Drawing Ray Diagrams for Diverging Lenses

Draw the three rays starting at the top of the object.

1. Ray R1 travels parallel to the principal axis. The ray bends and lines up with a focal

point. However, the concave lens is a diverging lens, so the ray must line up with the focal

point on the same side of the lens where light rays enter it. This means that we must

project an imaginary line backwards through that focal point (F1) (shown by the dashed

line extending from R1).

2. Ray R2 points towards the focal point F2 on the opposite side of the lens. When it hits

the lens, it is bent parallel to the principal axis.

3. Ray R3 passes through the optical center of the lens. Like for the convex lens, this ray

passes through with its direction unchanged.

4. We find the image by locating the point where the rays meet. Since the rays diverge,

they will only meet if projected backward to a point on the same side of the lens as the

object. This is why concave lenses always have virtual images. (Since the light rays do

not actually meet at the image, the image cannot be real.)

Figure 13.13 shows an object placed at an arbitrary distance from the diverging lens.

We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays for a diverging lens.

Figure 13.13 shows that the image of an object is upright. The image is called a virtual image

because it is on the same side of the lens as the object.

The image is smaller than the object and is closer to the lens than the object.

Step 2 : Draw the three light rays to locate the image

• R1 goes from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis. To determine

the angle it has when it leaves the lens on the other side, we draw the dashed

line from the focus F1 through the point where R1 hits the lens. (Remember:

for a diverging lens, the light ray on the opposite side of the lens to the object

has to bend away from the principal axis.)

• R2 goes from the top of the object in the direction of the other focal point F2.

After it passes through the lens, it travels parallel to the principal axis.

• R3 goes from the top of the lens, straight through the optical centre with its

direction unchanged.

• Just like for converging lenses, the image is found at the position where all the

light rays intersect.

Step 4 : Measure the distance to the object

The distance to the object is 2,4 cm.

Step 5 : Determine type of object

The image is on the same side of the lens as the object, and is upright. Therefore it

is virtual. (Remember: The image from a diverging lens is always virtual.)
