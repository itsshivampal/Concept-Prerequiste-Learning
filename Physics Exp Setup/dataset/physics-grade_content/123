8.3.3 Representing magnetic fields

Magnetic fields can be represented using magnetic field lines. Although the magnetic field of

a permanent magnet is everywhere surrounding the magnet (in all 3 dimensions), we draw only

some of the field lines to represent the field (usually only 2 dimensions are shown in drawings).

3-dimensional representation

2-dimensional representation

In areas where the magnetic field is strong, the field lines are closer together. Where the field is

weaker, the field lines are drawn further apart. The strength of a magnetic field is referred to as

the magnetic flux

Important:

1. Field lines never cross.

2. Arrows drawn on the field lines indicate the direction of the field.

3. A magnetic field points from the north to the south pole of a magnet.

Activity :: Investigation : Field around a Bar Magnet

Take a bar magnet and place it on a flat surface. Place a sheet of white paper

over the bar magnet and sprinkle some iron filings onto the paper. Give the paper a

shake to evenly distribute the iron filings. In your workbook, draw the bar magnet

and the pattern formed by the iron filings. Draw the pattern formed when you rotate

the bar magnet as shown.

8.3 CHAPTER 8. MAGNETISM - GRADE 10
As the activity shows, one can map the magnetic field of a magnet by placing it underneath a
piece of paper and sprinkling iron filings on top. The iron filings line themselves up parallel to
the magnetic field.
Another tool one can use to find the direction of a magnetic field is a compass. The compass
arrow points in the direction of the field.
The direction of the compass arrow is the
same as the direction of the magnetic field
Activity :: Investigation : Field around a Pair of Bar Magnets
Take two bar magnets and place them a short distance apart such that they are
repelling each other. Place a sheet of white paper over the bar magnets and sprinkle
some iron filings onto the paper. Give the paper a shake to evenly distribute the
iron filings. In your workbook, draw both the bar magnets and the pattern formed
by the iron filings. Repeat the procedure for two bar magnets attracting each other
and draw what the pattern looks like for this situation. Make a note of the shape of
the lines formed by the iron filings, as well as their size and their direction for both
arrangements of the bar magnet. What does the pattern look like when you place
both bar magnets side by side?

CHAPTER 8. MAGNETISM - GRADE 10 8.4

As already said, opposite poles of a magnet attract each other and bringing them together causes

their magnetic field lines to converge (come together). Like poles of a magnet repel each other

and bringing them together causes their magnetic field lines to diverge (bend out from each

other).

Extension: Ferromagnetism and Retentivity

Ferromagnetism is a phenomenon shown by materials like iron, nickel or cobalt.

These materials can form permanent magnets. They always magnetise so as to

be attracted to a magnet, no matter which magnetic pole is brought toward the

unmagnetised iron/nickel/cobalt.

The ability of a ferromagnetic material to retain its magnetisation after an external

field is removed is called its retentivity.

Paramagnetic materials are materials like aluminium or platinum, which become

magnetised in an external magnetic field in a similar way to ferromagnetic materials.

However, they lose their magnetism when the external magnetic field is removed.

Diamagnetism is shown by materials like copper or bismuth, which become mag-

netised in a magnetic field with a polarity opposite to the external magnetic field.

Unlike iron, they are slightly repelled by a magnet.
