4.5 Mechanical Energy

Important: Mechanical energy is the sum of the gravitational potential energy and the

kinetic energy.

Mechanical energy, U , is simply the sum of gravitational potential energy (PE) and the kinetic

energy (KE). Mechanical energy is defined as:

U = PE +KE (4.7)

U = PE +KE

U = mgh+ mv2 (4.8)
