4.5.2 Using the Law of Conservation of Energy

Mechanical energy is conserved (in the absence of friction). Therefore we can say that the sum

of the PE and the KE anywhere during the motion must be equal to the sum of the PE and

the KE anywhere else in the motion.

We can now apply this to the example of the suitcase on the cupboard. Consider the mechanical

energy of the suitcase at the top and at the bottom. We can say:

The mechanical energy (U) at the top.

The mechanical energy will remain constant

throughout the motion and will always be a maximum.

The mechanical energy (U) at the bottom.

Utop = Ubottom

PEtop +KEtop = PEbottom +KEbottom

4.5 CHAPTER 4. GRAVITY AND MECHANICAL ENERGY - GRADE 10

The suitcase will strike the ground with a velocity of 6,26 m·s−1.

From this we see that when an object is lifted, like the suitcase in our example, it gains potential

energy. As it falls back to the ground, it will lose this potential energy, but gain kinetic en-

ergy. We know that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form into

another. In our example, the potential energy that the suitcase loses is changed to kinetic energy.

The suitcase will have maximum potential energy at the top of the cupboard and maximum

kinetic energy at the bottom of the cupboard. Halfway down it will have half kinetic energy and

half potential energy. As it moves down, the potential energy will be converted (changed) into

kinetic energy until all the potential energy is gone and only kinetic energy is left. The 19,6 J of

potential energy at the top will become 19,6 J of kinetic energy at the bottom.

Worked Example 20: Using the Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Question: During a flood a tree truck of mass 100 kg falls down a waterfall. The

waterfall is 5 m high. If air resistance is ignored, calculate

1. the potential energy of the tree trunk at the top of the waterfall.

2. the kinetic energy of the tree trunk at the bottom of the waterfall.

3. the magnitude of the velocity of the tree trunk at the bottom of the waterfall.

m = 100 kg

waterfall

5 m

Answer

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

• The mass of the tree trunk m = 100 kg

• The height of the waterfall h = 5 m.

These are all in SI units so we do not have to convert.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

• Potential energy at the top

• Kinetic energy at the bottom

• Velocity at the bottom

Step 3 : Calculate the potential energy.

PE = mgh

PE = (100)(9,8)(5)

PE = 4900 J

Step 4 : Calculate the kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy of the tree trunk at the bottom of the waterfall is equal to the

potential energy it had at the top of the waterfall. Therefore KE = 4900 J.

Step 5 : Calculate the velocity.

The suitcase will strike the ground with a velocity of 6,26 m·s−1.
From this we see that when an object is lifted, like the suitcase in our example, it gains potential
energy. As it falls back to the ground, it will lose this potential energy, but gain kinetic en-
ergy. We know that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form into
another. In our example, the potential energy that the suitcase loses is changed to kinetic energy.
The suitcase will have maximum potential energy at the top of the cupboard and maximum
kinetic energy at the bottom of the cupboard. Halfway down it will have half kinetic energy and
half potential energy. As it moves down, the potential energy will be converted (changed) into
kinetic energy until all the potential energy is gone and only kinetic energy is left. The 19,6 J of
potential energy at the top will become 19,6 J of kinetic energy at the bottom.

This proves that the velocity of the ball is independent of its mass. It does not

matter what its mass is, it will always have the same velocity when it falls through

this height.
