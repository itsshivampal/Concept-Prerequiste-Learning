8.4 The compass and the earth's magnetic field

A compass is an instrument which is used to find the direction of a magnetic field. It can do

this because a compass consists of a small metal needle which is magnetised itself and which is

free to turn in any direction. Therefore, when in the presence of a magnetic field, the needle is

able to line up in the same direction as the field.

Itneterreessttinigng Lodestone, a magnetised form of iron-oxide, was found to orientate itself in a

FFacctt north-south direction if left free to rotate by suspension on a string or on a float

in water. Lodestone was therefore used as an early navigational compass.

Compasses are mainly used in navigation to find direction on the earth. This works because the

earth itself has a magnetic field which is similar to that of a bar magnet (see the picture below).

The compass needle aligns with the magnetic field direction and points north (or south). Once

you know where north is, you can figure out any other direction. A picture of a compass is shown

below:

Some animals can detect magnetic fields, which helps them orientate themselves and find di-

rection. Animals which can do this include pigeons, bees, Monarch butterflies, sea turtles and

fish.
