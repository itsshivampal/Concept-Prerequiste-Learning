28.4 Capacitance and inductance

Capacitors and inductors are found in many circuits. Capacitors store an electric field, and are

used as temporary power sources as well as minimize power fluctuations in major circuits.

Inductors work in conjunction with capacitors for electrical signal processing. Here we explain

the physics and applications of both.
