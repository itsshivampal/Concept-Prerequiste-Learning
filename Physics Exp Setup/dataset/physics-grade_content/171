11.4.1 Relative Directions

The simplest method of expressing direction is relative directions: to the left, to the right,

forward, backward, up and down.

11.3.1 Mathematical Representation

There are many ways of writing the symbol for a vector. Vectors are denoted by symbols with an

arrow pointing to the right above it. For example, ~a, ~v and F~ represent the vectors acceleration,

velocity and force, meaning they have both a magnitude and a direction.

Sometimes just the magnitude of a vector is needed. In this case, the arrow is omitted. In other

words, F denotes the magnitude of vector F~ . |F~ | is another way of representing the magnitude

of a vector.

11.3.2 Graphical Representation

Vectors are drawn as arrows. An arrow has both a magnitude (how long it is) and a direction

(the direction in which it points). The starting point of a vector is known as the tail and the

end point is known as the head.

11.4 Directions

There are many acceptable methods of writing vectors. As long as the vector has a magnitude

and a direction, it is most likely acceptable. These different methods come from the different

methods of expressing a direction for a vector.

forward, backward, up and down.
