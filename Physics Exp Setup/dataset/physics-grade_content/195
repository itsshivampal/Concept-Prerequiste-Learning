12.2.6 Finding the Resultant Force

The easiest way to determine a resultant force is to draw a free body diagram. Remember from

Chapter ?? that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vector's magnitude and the

direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in.

After we have done this, we have a diagram of vectors and we simply find the sum of the vectors

to get the resultant force.

Figure 12.1: (a) Force diagram of 2 forces acting on a box. (b) Free body diagram of the box.

For example, two people push on a box from opposite sides with forces of 4 N and 6 N respectively

as shown in Figure 12.1(a). The free body diagram in Figure 12.1(b) shows the object represented

by a dot and the two forces are represented by arrows with their tails on the dot.

As you can see, the arrows point in opposite directions and have different lengths. The resultant

force is 2 N to the left. This result can be obtained algebraically too, since the two forces act

along the same line. First, as in motion in one direction, choose a frame of reference. Secondly,

add the two vectors taking their directions into account.

For the example, assume that the positive direction is to the right, then:

FR = (+4N) + (−6N)

= −2N

= 2N to the left

Remember that a negative answer means that the force acts in the opposite direction to the one

that you chose to be positive. You can choose the positive direction to be any way you want,

but once you have chosen it you must keep it.

As you work with more force diagrams in which the forces exactly balance, you may notice that

you get a zero answer (e.g. 0 N). This simply means that the forces are balanced and that the

object will not move.

Once a force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in Chapter ??

can be used. Depending on the situation you might choose to use a graphical technique such as

the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method, or else an algebraic approach to determine

the resultant. Since force is a vector all of these methods apply.

Worked Example 62: Finding the resultant force

Question: A car (mass 1200 kg) applies a force of 2000 N on a trailer (mass 250

kg). A constant frictional force of 200 N is acting on the trailer, and 300 N is acting

on the car.

1. Draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the car.

2. Draw a free body diagram of all the horizontal forces acting on the trailer.

3. Use the force diagram to determine the resultant force on the trailer.

Answer

Step 1 : Draw the force diagram for the car.

The question asks us to draw all the forces on the car. This means that we must

include horizontal and vertical forces.

Step 2 : Draw the free body diagram for the trailer.

The question only asks for horizontal forces. We will therefore not include the force

of the Earth on the trailer, or the force of the road on the trailer as these forces are

in a vertical direction.

F1: Force of car on trailer (to the right) (2000 N)

b

Ff : Frictional force on trailer (to the left) (200 N)

Step 3 : Determine the resultant force on the trailer.

To find the resultant force we need to add all the horizontal forces together. We do

not add vertical forces as the movement of the car and trailer will be in a horizontal

direction, and not up and down. FR = 2000 + (-200) = 1800 N to the right.
