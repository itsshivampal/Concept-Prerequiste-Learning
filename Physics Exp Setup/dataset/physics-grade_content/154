How does the current through the battery in a circuit with several resistors in parallel compare

to the current in a circuit with a single resistor?

Activity :: Experiment : Current in Series Circuits

Aim:

To determine the effect of multiple resistors on current in a circuit

Apparatus:

• Battery

• Resistors

• Light bulb

• Wires

Method:

1. Construct the following circuits

2. Rank the three circuits in terms of the brightness of the bulb.

Conclusions:

The brightness of the bulb is an indicator of how much current is flowing. If the

bulb gets brighter because of a change then more current is flowing. If the bulb gets

dimmer less current is flowing. You will find that the more resistors you have the

brighter the bulb.

Why is this the case? Why do more resistors make it easier for charge to flow in the circuit?

It is because they are in parallel so there are more paths for charge to take to move. You can

think of it like a highway with more lanes, or the tube of marbles splitting into multiple parallel

tubes. The more branches there are, the easier it is for charge to flow. You will learn more about

the total resistance of parallel resistors later but always remember that more resistors in parallel

mean more pathways. In series the pathways come one after the other so it does not make it

easier for charge to flow.

the 2 resistors in parallel result in a

lower total resistance and therefore

a higher current in the circuit
