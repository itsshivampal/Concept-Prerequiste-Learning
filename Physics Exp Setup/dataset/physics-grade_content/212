12.5.1 Vector Nature of Momentum

As we have said, momentum is a vector quantity. Since momentum is a vector, the techniques

of vector addition discussed in Chapter ?? must be used to calculate the total momentum of a

system.

Worked Example 88: Calculating the Total Momentum of a System

Question: Two billiard balls roll towards each other. They each have a mass of

0,3 kg. Ball 1 is moving at v1 = 1m · s−1 to the right, while ball 2 is moving at

v2 = 0,8m · s−1 to the left. Calculate the total momentum of the system.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for

The question explicitly gives

• the mass of each ball,

• the velocity of ball 1, v1, and

• the velocity of ball 2, v2,

all in the correct units!

We are asked to calculate the total momentum of the system. In this example

our system consists of two balls. To find the total momentum we must determine

the momentum of each ball and add them.

ptotal = p1 + p2

Since ball 1 is moving to the right, its momentum is in this direction, while the

second ball's momentum is directed towards the left.

m1 m2

v1 v2

Thus, we are required to find the sum of two vectors acting along the same straight

line. The algebraic method of vector addition introduced in Chapter ?? can thus be

used.

Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference

Let us choose right as the positive direction, then obviously left is negative.

Step 3 : Calculate the momentum

The total momentum of the system is then the sum of the two momenta taking the

directions of the velocities into account. Ball 1 is travelling at 1 m·s−1to the right

or +1 m·s−1. Ball 2 is travelling at 0,8 m·s−1to the left or -0,8 m·s−1. Thus,

ptotal = m1v1 +m2v2

= (0,3)(+1) + (0,3)(−0,8)

= (+0,3) + (−0,24)

= +0,06 kg · m · s−1

= 0,06 kg · m · s−1to the right

In the last step the direction was added in words. Since the result in the second last

line is positive, the total momentum of the system is in the positive direction (i.e.

to the right).

Step 3 : Finally calculate the momentum and quote the answer

The magnitude of the Moon's momentum is:

p = m · v

= (7,35× 1022)(1,02× 103)

= 7,50× 1025 kg · m · s−1
