10.2.5 EMF

When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery you

are measuring the "electromotive force" (emf) of the battery. This is how much potential energy

the battery has to make charges move through the circuit. This driving potential energy is equal

to the total potential energy drops in the circuit. This means that the voltage across the battery

is equal to the sum of the voltages in the circuit.

We can use this information to solve problems in which the voltages across elements in a circuit

add up to the emf.

EMF = Vtotal

Worked Example 45: Voltages I

What is the voltage across

Question: the resistor in the circuit 2V V1

shown?

Answer

Step 1 : Check what you have and the units

We have a circuit with a battery and one resistor. We know the voltage across the

battery. We want to find that voltage across the resistor.

Vbattery = 2V

Step 2 : Applicable principles

We know that the voltage across the battery must be equal to the total voltage

across all other circuit components.

Vbattery = Vtotal

10.2 CHAPTER 10. ELECTRIC CIRCUITS - GRADE 10

There is only one other circuit component, the resistor.

Vtotal = V1

This means that the voltage across the battery is the same as the voltage across the

resistor.

Vbattery = Vtotal = V1

Vbattery = Vtotal = V1

V1 = 2V

Answer

Step 1 : Check what you have and the units

We have a circuit with a battery and two resistors. We know the voltage across the

battery and one of the resistors. We want to find that voltage across the resistor.

Vbattery = 2V

Vresistor = 1V

Step 2 : Applicable principles

We know that the voltage across the battery must be equal to the total voltage

across all other circuit components.

Vbattery = Vtotal

The total voltage in the circuit is the sum of the voltages across the individual

resistors

Vtotal = V1 + Vresistor

Using the relationship between the voltage across the battery and total voltage across

the resistors

Vbattery = Vtotal

Vbattery = V1 + Vresistor

2V = V1 + 1V

V1 = 1V
