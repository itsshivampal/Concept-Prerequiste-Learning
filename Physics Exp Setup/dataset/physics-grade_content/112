7.6 Total Internal Reflection and Fibre Optics

7.6.1 Total Internal Reflection

Activity :: Investigation : Total Internal Reflection

Work in groups of four. Each group will need a raybox (or torch) with slit,

triangular glass prism and protractor. If you do not have a raybox, use a torch and

stick two pieces of tape over the lens so that only a thin beam of light is visible.

Aim:

To investigate total internal reflection.

1. Place the raybox next to the glass block so that the light shines right through

without any refraction. See "Position 1" in diagram.

2. Move the raybox such that the light is refracted by the glass. See "Position 2".

3. Move the raybox further and observe what happens.

4. Move the raybox until the refracted ray seems to disappear. See "Position 4".

The angle of the incident light is called the critical angle.

θi = θc

Position 4

5. Move the raybox further and observe what happens. See "Position 5". The

light shines back into the glass block. This is called total internal reflection.
