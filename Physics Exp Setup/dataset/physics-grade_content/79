6.2.5 Speed of a Transverse Wave

In Chapter 3, we saw that speed was defined as

distance travelled

speed = .

time taken

The distance between two successive peaks is 1 wavelength, λ. Thus in a time of 1 period, the

wave will travel 1 wavelength in distance. Thus the speed of the wave, v, is:

distance travelled λ

v = = .

time taken T

However, f = 1 . Therefore, we can also write:

T

= λ · f

We call this equation the wave equation. To summarise, we have that v = λ · f where

• v= speed in m·s−1

• λ= wavelength in m

• f = frequency in Hz

Worked Example 28: Speed of a Transverse Wave 1

Question: When a particular string is vibrated at a frequency of 10Hz, a transverse

wave of wavelength 0,25m is produced. Determine the speed of the wave as it

travels along the string.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

• frequency of wave: f = 10Hz

• wavelength of wave: λ = 0,25m

We are required to calculate the speed of the wave as it travels along the string. All

quantities are in SI units.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We know that the speed of a wave is:

v = f · λ

and we are given all the necessary quantities.

Step 3 : Substituting in the values

v = f · λ

= (10 Hz)(0,25m)

= 2,5m · s−1

Step 4 : Write the final answer

The wave travels at 2,5m·s−1 in the string.

Worked Example 29: Speed of a Transverse Wave 2

Question: A cork on the surface of a swimming pool bobs up and down once per

second on some ripples. The ripples have a wavelength of 20 cm. If the cork is 2m

from the edge of the pool, how long does it take a ripple passing the cork to reach

the shore?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

We are given:

• frequency of wave: f = 1Hz

• wavelength of wave: λ = 20 cm

• distance of leaf from edge of pool: d = 2m

We are required to determine the time it takes for a ripple to travel between the cork

and the edge of the pool.

The wavelength is not in SI units and should be converted.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

The time taken for the ripple to reach the edge of the pool is obtained from:
