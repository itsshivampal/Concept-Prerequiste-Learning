Definition: Law of Reflection

The Law of Reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

θi = θr

The simplest example of the law of incidence is if the angle of incidence is 0◦. In this case, the

angle of reflection is also 0◦. You see this when you look straight into a mirror.

directly back.

If the angle of incidence is not 0◦, then the angle of reflection is also not 0◦. For example, if a

light strikes a surface at 60◦ to the surface normal, then the angle that the reflected ray makes

with the surface normal is also 60◦ as shown in Figure 7.7.

states that when a light ray reflects off a surface, the angle of reflection θr is the same as the

angle of incidence θi.

Worked Example 31: Law of Reflection

Question: An incident ray strikes a smooth reflective surface at an angle of 33◦ to

the surface normal. Calculate the angle of reflection.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required

We are given the angle between the incident ray and the surface normal. This is the

angle of incidence.

We are required to calculate the angle of reflection.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We can use the Law of Reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal

to the angle of reflection.

Step 3 : Calculate the angle of reflection

We are given the angle of incidence to be 33◦. Therefore, the angle of reflection is

also 33◦.
