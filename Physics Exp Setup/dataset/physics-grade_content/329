20.1 Introduction

We can study many different features of solids. Just a few of the things we could study are

how hard or soft they are, what are their magnetic properties or how well do they conduct heat.

The thing that we are interested in, in this chapter are their electronic properties. Simply how

well do they conduct electricity and how do they do it.

We are only going to discuss materials that form a 3-dimensional lattice. This means that the

atoms that make up the material have a regular pattern (carbon, silicon, etc.). We won't

discuss materials where the atoms are jumbled together in a irregular way (plastic, glass,

rubber etc.).
