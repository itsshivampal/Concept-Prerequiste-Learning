13.2.3 Summary of Image Properties

The properties of the images formed by converging and diverging lenses depend on the position

of the object. The properties are summarised in the Table 13.1.

Image Properties

Lens type Object Position Position Orientation Size Type

Converging > 2f < 2f inverted smaller real

Converging 2f 2f inverted same size real

Converging > f, < 2f > 2f inverted larger real

Converging f no image formed

Converging < f > f upright larger virtual

Diverging any position < f upright smaller virtual

Exercise: Diverging Lenses

1. An object 3 cm high is at right angles to the principal axis of a concave lens of

focal length 15 cm. If the distance from the object to the lens is 30 cm, find

the distance of the image from the lens, and its height. Is it real or virtual?

2. The image formed by a concave lens of focal length 10 cm is 7,5 cm from the

lens and is 1,5 cm high. Find the distance of the object from the lens, and its

height.

3. An object 6 cm high is 10 cm from a concave lens. The image formed is 3 cm

high. Find the focal length of the lens and the distance of the image from the

lens.

Step 2 : Draw the three light rays to locate the image

• R1 goes from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis. To determine

the angle it has when it leaves the lens on the other side, we draw the dashed

line from the focus F1 through the point where R1 hits the lens. (Remember:

for a diverging lens, the light ray on the opposite side of the lens to the object

has to bend away from the principal axis.)

• R2 goes from the top of the object in the direction of the other focal point F2.

After it passes through the lens, it travels parallel to the principal axis.

• R3 goes from the top of the lens, straight through the optical centre with its

direction unchanged.

• Just like for converging lenses, the image is found at the position where all the

light rays intersect.

Step 3 : Draw the image

Draw the image at the point where all three rays intersect.

Step 4 : Measure the distance to the object

The distance to the object is 2,4 cm.

Step 5 : Determine type of object

The image is on the same side of the lens as the object, and is upright. Therefore it

is virtual. (Remember: The image from a diverging lens is always virtual.)

The properties of the images formed by converging and diverging lenses depend on the position

of the object. The properties are summarised in the Table 13.1.

1. An object 3 cm high is at right angles to the principal axis of a concave lens of

focal length 15 cm. If the distance from the object to the lens is 30 cm, find

the distance of the image from the lens, and its height. Is it real or virtual?

2. The image formed by a concave lens of focal length 10 cm is 7,5 cm from the

lens and is 1,5 cm high. Find the distance of the object from the lens, and its

height.

3. An object 6 cm high is 10 cm from a concave lens. The image formed is 3 cm

high. Find the focal length of the lens and the distance of the image from the

lens.
