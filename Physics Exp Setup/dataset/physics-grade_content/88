6.5 Summary

1. A wave is formed when a continuous number of pulses are transmitted through a medium.

2. A peak is the highest point a particle in the medium rises to.

3. A trough is the lowest point a particle in the medium sinks to.

4. In a transverse wave, the particles move perpendicular to the motion of the wave.

5. The amplitude is the maximum distance from equilibrium position to a peak (or trough),

or the maximum displacement of a particle in a wave from its position of rest.

6. The wavelength (λ) is the distance between any two adjacent points on a wave that are

in phase. It is measured in metres.

7. The period (T ) of a wave is the time it takes a wavelength to pass a fixed point. It is

measured in seconds (s).

8. The frequency (f) of a wave is how many waves pass a point in a second. It is measured

in hertz (Hz) or s−1.

9. Frequency: f = 1

10. Period: T = 1

f

11. Speed: v = fλ or v = λT .

12. When a wave is reflected from a fixed end, the resulting wave will move back through the

medium, but will be inverted. When a wave is reflected from a free end, the waves are

reflected, but not inverted.

13. Standing waves.
