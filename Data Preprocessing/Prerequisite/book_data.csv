0,1,Introduction,"1 Introduction. The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has a long and. successful history. For instance, the extensive astronomical observations of Tycho. Brahe in the 16th century allowed Johannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of. planetary motion, which in turn provided a springboard for the development of clas-. sical mechanics. Similarly, the discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a. key role in the development and verification of quantum physics in the early twenti-. eth century. The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discov-. ery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of. these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.. Consider the example of recognizing handwritten digits, illustrated in Figure 1.1.. Each digit corresponds to a 28×28 pixel image and so can be represented by a vector. x comprising 784 real numbers. The goal is to build a machine that will take such a. vector x as input and that will produce the identity of the digit 0, . . . , 9 as the output.. This is a nontrivial problem due to the wide variability of handwriting. It could be. 1. 2. 1. INTRODUCTION. Figure 1.1 Examples of hand-written dig-. its taken from US zip codes.. tackled using handcrafted rules or heuristics for distinguishing the digits based on. the shapes of the strokes, but in practice such an approach leads to a proliferation of. rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on, and invariably gives poor results.. Far better results can be obtained by adopting a machine learning approach in. which a large set of N digits {x1, . . . , xN} called a training set is used to tune the. parameters of an adaptive model. The categories of the digits in the training set. are known in advance, typically by inspecting them individually and hand-labelling. them. We can express the category of a digit using target vector t, which represents. the identity of the corresponding digit. Suitable techniques for representing cate-. gories in terms of vectors will be discussed later. Note that there is one such target. vector t for each digit image x.. The result of running the machine learning algorithm can be expressed as a. function y(x) which takes a new digit image x as input and that generates an output. vector y, encoded in the same way as the target vectors. The precise form of the. function y(x) is determined during the training phase, also known as the learning. phase, on the basis of the training data. Once the model is trained it can then de-. termine the identity of new digit images, which are said to comprise a test set. The. ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for train-. ing is known as generalization. In practical applications, the variability of the input. vectors will be such that the training data can comprise only a tiny fraction of all. possible input vectors, and so generalization is a central goal in pattern recognition.. For most practical applications, the original input variables are typically prepro-. cessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the. pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve. For instance, in the digit recogni-. tion problem, the images of the digits are typically translated and scaled so that each. digit is contained within a box of a fixed size. This greatly reduces the variability. within each digit class, because the location and scale of all the digits are now the. same, which makes it much easier for a subsequent pattern recognition algorithm. to distinguish between the different classes. This pre-processing stage is sometimes. also called feature extraction. Note that new test data must be pre-processed using. the same steps as the training data.. Pre-processing might also be performed in order to speed up computation. For. example, if the goal is real-time face detection in a high-resolution video stream,. the computer must handle huge numbers of pixels per second, and presenting these. directly to a complex pattern recognition algorithm may be computationally infeasi-. ble. Instead, the aim is to find useful features that are fast to compute, and yet that. 1. INTRODUCTION. 3. also preserve useful discriminatory information enabling faces to be distinguished. from non-faces. These features are then used as the inputs to the pattern recognition. algorithm. For instance, the average value of the image intensity over a rectangular. subregion can be evaluated extremely efficiently (Viola and Jones, 2004), and a set of. such features can prove very effective in fast face detection. Because the number of. such features is smaller than the number of pixels, this kind of pre-processing repre-. sents a form of dimensionality reduction. Care must be taken during pre-processing. because often information is discarded, and if this information is important to the. solution of the problem then the overall accuracy of the system can suffer.. Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors. along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning prob-. lems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each. input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories, are called classification. problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then. the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the pre-. diction of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist. of the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure.. In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input. vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised. learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data,. where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input. space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional. space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization.. Finally, the technique of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is con-. cerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in. order to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of. optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them. by a process of trial and error. Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in. which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment. In many cases, the. current action not only affects the immediate reward but also has an impact on the re-. ward at all subsequent time steps. For example, by using appropriate reinforcement. learning techniques a neural network can learn to play the game of backgammon to a. high standard (Tesauro, 1994). Here the network must learn to take a board position. as input, along with the result of a dice throw, and produce a strong move as the. output. This is done by having the network play against a copy of itself for perhaps a. million games. A major challenge is that a game of backgammon can involve dozens. of moves, and yet it is only at the end of the game that the reward, in the form of. victory, is achieved. The reward must then be attributed appropriately to all of the. moves that led to it, even though some moves will have been good ones and others. less so. This is an example of a credit assignment problem. A general feature of re-. inforcement learning is the trade-off between exploration, in which the system tries. out new kinds of actions to see how effective they are, and exploitation, in which. the system makes use of actions that are known to yield a high reward. Too strong. a focus on either exploration or exploitation will yield poor results. Reinforcement. learning continues to be an active area of machine learning research. However, a. 4. 1. INTRODUCTION.

Although each of these tasks needs its own tools and techniques, many of the. key ideas that underpin them are common to all such problems. One of the main. goals of this chapter is to introduce, in a relatively informal way, several of the most. important of these concepts and to illustrate them using simple examples. Later in. the book we shall see these same ideas re-emerge in the context of more sophisti-. cated models that are applicable to real-world pattern recognition applications. This. chapter also provides a self-contained introduction to three important tools that will. be used throughout the book, namely probability theory, decision theory, and infor-. mation theory. Although these might sound like daunting topics, they are in fact. straightforward, and a clear understanding of them is essential if machine learning. techniques are to be used to best effect in practical applications.. "
1,1.1,Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting,"We begin by introducing a simple regression problem, which we shall use as a run-. ning example throughout this chapter to motivate a number of key concepts. Sup-. pose we observe a real-valued input variable x and we wish to use this observation to. predict the value of a real-valued target variable t. For the present purposes, it is in-. structive to consider an artificial example using synthetically generated data because. we then know the precise process that generated the data for comparison against any. learned model. The data for this example is generated from the function sin(2πx). with random noise included in the target values, as described in detail in Appendix A.. Now suppose that we are given a training set comprising N observations of x,. written x ≡ (x1, . . . , xN )T, together with corresponding observations of the values. of t, denoted t ≡ (t1, . . . , tN )T. Figure 1.2 shows a plot of a training set comprising. N = 10 data points. The input data set x in Figure 1.2 was generated by choos-. ing values of xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, spaced uniformly in range [0, 1], and the target. data set t was obtained by first computing the corresponding values of the function. 5. M. N. 1.1. Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting. sin(2πx) and then adding a small level of random noise having a Gaussian distri-. bution (the Gaussian distribution is discussed in Section 1.2.4) to each such point in. order to obtain the corresponding value tn. By generating data in this way, we are. capturing a property of many real data sets, namely that they possess an underlying. regularity, which we wish to learn, but that individual observations are corrupted by. random noise. This noise might arise from intrinsically stochastic (i.e. random) pro-. cesses such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to there being sources of. variability that are themselves unobserved.. Our goal is to exploit this training set in order to make predictions of the value. t of the target variable for some new value. x of the input variable. As we shall see. later, this involves implicitly trying to discover the underlying function sin(2πx).. This is intrinsically a difficult problem as we have to generalize from a finite data. set. Furthermore the observed data are corrupted with noise, and so for a given. x. t. Probability theory, discussed. there is uncertainty as to the appropriate value for. in Section 1.2, provides a framework for expressing such uncertainty in a precise. and quantitative manner, and decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, allows us to. exploit this probabilistic representation in order to make predictions that are optimal. according to appropriate criteria.. For the moment, however, we shall proceed rather informally and consider a. simple approach based on curve fitting. In particular, we shall fit the data using a. polynomial function of the form. y(x, w) = w0 + w1x + w2x2 + . . . + wM xM =. wjxj. (1.1). j=0. where M is the order of the polynomial, and xj denotes x raised to the power of j.. The polynomial coefficients w0, . . . , wM are collectively denoted by the vector w.. Note that, although the polynomial function y(x, w) is a nonlinear function of x, it. is a linear function of the coefficients w. Functions, such as the polynomial, which. are linear in the unknown parameters have important properties and are called linear. models and will be discussed extensively in Chapters 3 and 4.. The values of the coefficients will be determined by fitting the polynomial to the. training data. This can be done by minimizing an error function that measures the. misfit between the function y(x, w), for any given value of w, and the training set. data points. One simple choice of error function, which is widely used, is given by. the sum of the squares of the errors between the predictions y(xn, w) for each data. point xn and the corresponding target values tn, so that we minimize. E(w) =. 1. 2. {y(xn, w) − tn}2. n=1. (1.2). where the factor of 1/2 is included for later convenience. We shall discuss the mo-. tivation for this choice of error function later in this chapter. For the moment we. simply note that it is a nonnegative quantity that would be zero if, and only if, the. 6. 1. INTRODUCTION. Figure 1.3 The error. function (1.2) corre-. sponds to (one half of) the sum of. the squares of the displacements. (shown by the vertical green bars). of each data point from the function. y(x, w).. t. tn. y(xn, w). xn. x. function y(x, w) were to pass exactly through each training data point. The geomet-. rical interpretation of the sum-of-squares error function is illustrated in Figure 1.3.. We can solve the curve fitting problem by choosing the value of w for which. E(w) is as small as possible. Because the error function is a quadratic function of. the coefficients w, its derivatives with respect to the coefficients will be linear in the. elements of w, and so the minimization of the error function has a unique solution,. denoted by w, which can be found in closed form. The resulting polynomial is. given by the function y(x, w).. Exercise 1.1. There remains the problem of choosing the order M of the polynomial, and as. we shall see this will turn out to be an example of an important concept called model. comparison or model selection. In Figure 1.4, we show four examples of the results. of fitting polynomials having orders M = 0, 1, 3, and 9 to the data set shown in. Figure 1.2.. We notice that the constant (M = 0) and first order (M = 1) polynomials. give rather poor fits to the data and consequently rather poor representations of the. function sin(2πx). The third order (M = 3) polynomial seems to give the best fit. to the function sin(2πx) of the examples shown in Figure 1.4. When we go to a. much higher order polynomial (M = 9), we obtain an excellent fit to the training. data. In fact, the polynomial passes exactly through each data point and E(w) = 0.. However, the fitted curve oscillates wildly and gives a very poor representation of. the function sin(2πx). This latter behaviour is known as over-fitting.. As we have noted earlier, the goal is to achieve good generalization by making. accurate predictions for new data. We can obtain some quantitative insight into the. dependence of the generalization performance on M by considering a separate test. set comprising 100 data points generated using exactly the same procedure used. to generate the training set points but with new choices for the random noise values. included in the target values. For each choice of M, we can then evaluate the residual. value of E(w) given by (1.2) for the training data, and we can also evaluate E(w). for the test data set. It is sometimes more convenient to use the root-mean-square. Figure 1.4 Plots of polynomials having various orders M, shown as red curves, fitted to the data set shown in. Figure 1.2.. (RMS) error defined by. ERMS =. 2E(w)/N. (1.3). in which the division by N allows us to compare different sizes of data sets on. an equal footing, and the square root ensures that ERMS is measured on the same. scale (and in the same units) as the target variable t. Graphs of the training and. test set RMS errors are shown, for various values of M, in Figure 1.5. The test. set error is a measure of how well we are doing in predicting the values of t for. new data observations of x. We note from Figure 1.5 that small values of M give. relatively large values of the test set error, and this can be attributed to the fact that. the corresponding polynomials are rather inflexible and are incapable of capturing. the oscillations in the function sin(2πx). Values of M in the range 3 � M � 8. give small values for the test set error, and these also give reasonable representations. of the generating function sin(2πx), as can be seen, for the case of M = 3, from.

For M = 9, the training set error goes to zero, as we might expect because. this polynomial contains 10 degrees of freedom corresponding to the 10 coefficients. w0, . . . , w9, and so can be tuned exactly to the 10 data points in the training set.. However, the test set error has become very large and, as we saw in Figure 1.4, the. corresponding function y(x, w) exhibits wild oscillations.. This may seem paradoxical because a polynomial of given order contains all. lower order polynomials as special cases. The M = 9 polynomial is therefore capa-. ble of generating results at least as good as the M = 3 polynomial. Furthermore, we. might suppose that the best predictor of new data would be the function sin(2πx). from which the data was generated (and we shall see later that this is indeed the. case). We know that a power series expansion of the function sin(2πx) contains. terms of all orders, so we might expect that results should improve monotonically as. we increase M.. We can gain some insight into the problem by examining the values of the co-. efficients w obtained from polynomials of various order, as shown in Table 1.1.. We see that, as M increases, the magnitude of the coefficients typically gets larger.. In particular for the M = 9 polynomial, the coefficients have become finely tuned. to the data by developing large positive and negative values so that the correspond-.

Figure 1.6 Plots of the solutions obtained by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function using the M = 9. polynomial for N = 15 data points (left plot) and N = 100 data points (right plot). We see that increasing the. size of the data set reduces the over-fitting problem.. ing polynomial function matches each of the data points exactly, but between data. points (particularly near the ends of the range) the function exhibits the large oscilla-. tions observed in Figure 1.4. Intuitively, what is happening is that the more flexible. polynomials with larger values of M are becoming increasingly tuned to the random. noise on the target values.. It is also interesting to examine the behaviour of a given model as the size of the. data set is varied, as shown in Figure 1.6. We see that, for a given model complexity,. the over-fitting problem become less severe as the size of the data set increases.. Another way to say this is that the larger the data set, the more complex (in other. words more flexible) the model that we can afford to fit to the data. One rough. heuristic that is sometimes advocated is that the number of data points should be. no less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of adaptive parameters in. the model. However, as we shall see in Chapter 3, the number of parameters is not. necessarily the most appropriate measure of model complexity.. Also, there is something rather unsatisfying about having to limit the number of. parameters in a model according to the size of the available training set. It would. seem more reasonable to choose the complexity of the model according to the com-. plexity of the problem being solved. We shall see that the least squares approach. to finding the model parameters represents a specific case of maximum likelihood. (discussed in Section 1.2.5), and that the over-fitting problem can be understood as. a general property of maximum likelihood. By adopting a Bayesian approach, the. over-fitting problem can be avoided. We shall see that there is no difficulty from. a Bayesian perspective in employing models for which the number of parameters. greatly exceeds the number of data points. Indeed, in a Bayesian model the effective. number of parameters adapts automatically to the size of the data set.. For the moment, however, it is instructive to continue with the current approach. and to consider how in practice we can apply it to data sets of limited size where we. Section 3.4. t. N. 1. 0. −1. may wish to use relatively complex and flexible models. One technique that is often. used to control the over-fitting phenomenon in such cases is that of regularization,. which involves adding a penalty term to the error function (1.2) in order to discourage. the coefficients from reaching large values. The simplest such penalty term takes the. form of a sum of squares of all of the coefficients, leading to a modified error function. of the form. E(w) =. 1. 2. {y(xn, w) − tn}2 + λ. 2w2. (1.4). n=1. 1 + . . . + w2. 0 + w2. where w2 ≡ wTw = w2. M , and the coefficient λ governs the rel-. ative importance of the regularization term compared with the sum-of-squares error. term. Note that often the coefficient w0 is omitted from the regularizer because its. inclusion causes the results to depend on the choice of origin for the target variable. (Hastie et al., 2001), or it may be included but with its own regularization coefficient. (we shall discuss this topic in more detail in Section 5.5.1). Again, the error function. in (1.4) can be minimized exactly in closed form. Techniques such as this are known. in the statistics literature as shrinkage methods because they reduce the value of the. coefficients. The particular case of a quadratic regularizer is called ridge regres-. sion (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970). In the context of neural networks, this approach is. known as weight decay.. Figure 1.7 shows the results of fitting the polynomial of order M = 9 to the. same data set as before but now using the regularized error function given by (1.4).. We see that, for a value of ln λ = −18, the over-fitting has been suppressed and we. now obtain a much closer representation of the underlying function sin(2πx). If,. however, we use too large a value for λ then we again obtain a poor fit, as shown in. Figure 1.7 for ln λ = 0. The corresponding coefficients from the fitted polynomials. are given in Table 1.2, showing that regularization has the desired effect of reducing. Exercise 1.2. 10. 1.

The impact of the regularization term on the generalization error can be seen by. plotting the value of the RMS error (1.3) for both training and test sets against ln λ,. as shown in Figure 1.8. We see that in effect λ now controls the effective complexity. of the model and hence determines the degree of over-fitting.. The issue of model complexity is an important one and will be discussed at. length in Section 1.3. Here we simply note that, if we were trying to solve a practical. application using this approach of minimizing an error function, we would have to. find a way to determine a suitable value for the model complexity. The results above. suggest a simple way of achieving this, namely by taking the available data and. partitioning it into a training set, used to determine the coefficients w, and a separate. validation set, also called a hold-out set, used to optimize the model complexity. (either M or λ).. In many cases, however, this will prove to be too wasteful of. valuable training data, and we have to seek more sophisticated approaches.. So far our discussion of polynomial curve fitting has appealed largely to in-. tuition. We now seek a more principled approach to solving problems in pattern. recognition by turning to a discussion of probability theory. As well as providing the. foundation for nearly all of the subsequent developments in this book, it will also. Section 1.3.

INTRODUCTION. give us some important insights into the concepts we have introduced in the con-. text of polynomial curve fitting and will allow us to extend these to more complex. situations.. "
2,1.2,Probability Theory,"A key concept in the field of pattern recognition is that of uncertainty. It arises both. through noise on measurements, as well as through the finite size of data sets. Prob-. ability theory provides a consistent framework for the quantification and manipula-. tion of uncertainty and forms one of the central foundations for pattern recognition.. When combined with decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, it allows us to make. optimal predictions given all the information available to us, even though that infor-. mation may be incomplete or ambiguous.. We will introduce the basic concepts of probability theory by considering a sim-. ple example. Imagine we have two boxes, one red and one blue, and in the red box. we have 2 apples and 6 oranges, and in the blue box we have 3 apples and 1 orange.. This is illustrated in Figure 1.9. Now suppose we randomly pick one of the boxes. and from that box we randomly select an item of fruit, and having observed which. sort of fruit it is we replace it in the box from which it came. We could imagine. repeating this process many times. Let us suppose that in so doing we pick the red. box 40% of the time and we pick the blue box 60% of the time, and that when we. remove an item of fruit from a box we are equally likely to select any of the pieces. of fruit in the box.. In this example, the identity of the box that will be chosen is a random variable,. which we shall denote by B. This random variable can take one of two possible. values, namely r (corresponding to the red box) or b (corresponding to the blue. box). Similarly, the identity of the fruit is also a random variable and will be denoted. by F . It can take either of the values a (for apple) or o (for orange).. To begin with, we shall define the probability of an event to be the fraction. of times that event occurs out of the total number of trials, in the limit that the total. number of trials goes to infinity. Thus the probability of selecting the red box is 4/10. Figure 1.9 We use a simple example of two. coloured boxes each containing fruit. (apples shown in green and or-. anges shown in orange) to intro-. duce the basic ideas of probability.. Figure 1.10 We can derive the sum and product rules of probability by. considering two random variables, X, which takes the values {xi} where. i = 1, . . . , M, and Y , which takes the values {yj} where j = 1, . . . , L.. In this illustration we have M = 5 and L = 3.. If we consider a total. number N of instances of these variables, then we denote the number. of instances where X = xi and Y = yj by nij, which is the number of. points in the corresponding cell of the array. The number of points in. column i, corresponding to X = xi, is denoted by ci, and the number of. points in row j, corresponding to Y = yj, is denoted by rj.. yj. 1.2. Probability Theory. 13. rj. ci. nij. xi. and the probability of selecting the blue box is 6/10. We write these probabilities. as p(B = r) = 4/10 and p(B = b) = 6/10. Note that, by definition, probabilities. must lie in the interval [0, 1]. Also, if the events are mutually exclusive and if they. include all possible outcomes (for instance, in this example the box must be either. red or blue), then we see that the probabilities for those events must sum to one.. We can now ask questions such as: “what is the overall probability that the se-. lection procedure will pick an apple?”, or “given that we have chosen an orange,. what is the probability that the box we chose was the blue one?”. We can answer. questions such as these, and indeed much more complex questions associated with. problems in pattern recognition, once we have equipped ourselves with the two el-. ementary rules of probability, known as the sum rule and the product rule. Having. obtained these rules, we shall then return to our boxes of fruit example.. In order to derive the rules of probability, consider the slightly more general ex-. ample shown in Figure 1.10 involving two random variables X and Y (which could. for instance be the Box and Fruit variables considered above). We shall suppose that. X can take any of the values xi where i = 1, . . . , M, and Y can take the values yj. where j = 1, . . . , L. Consider a total of N trials in which we sample both of the. variables X and Y , and let the number of such trials in which X = xi and Y = yj. be nij. Also, let the number of trials in which X takes the value xi (irrespective. of the value that Y takes) be denoted by ci, and similarly let the number of trials in. which Y takes the value yj be denoted by rj.. The probability that X will take the value xi and Y will take the value yj is. written p(X = xi, Y = yj) and is called the joint probability of X = xi and. Y = yj. It is given by the number of points falling in the cell i,j as a fraction of the. total number of points, and hence. Here we are implicitly considering the limit N → ∞. Similarly, the probability that. X takes the value xi irrespective of the value of Y is written as p(X = xi) and is. given by the fraction of the total number of points that fall in column i, so that. p(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij. N. p(X = xi) = ci. N. (1.5). (1.6). Because the number of instances in column i in Figure 1.10 is just the sum of the. number of instances in each cell of that column, we have ci =. j nij and therefore,. L. j=1. 14. 1. INTRODUCTION. from (1.5) and (1.6), we have. p(X = xi) =. p(X = xi, Y = yj). (1.7). which is the sum rule of probability. Note that p(X = xi) is sometimes called the. marginal probability, because it is obtained by marginalizing, or summing out, the. other variables (in this case Y ).. If we consider only those instances for which X = xi, then the fraction of. such instances for which Y = yj is written p(Y = yj|X = xi) and is called the. conditional probability of Y = yj given X = xi.. It is obtained by finding the. fraction of those points in column i that fall in cell i,j and hence is given by. p(Y = yj|X = xi) = nij. (1.8). From (1.5), (1.6), and (1.8), we can then derive the following relationship. ci. p(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij. N. = nij. ci. ci. N. = p(Y = yj|X = xi)p(X = xi). (1.9). which is the product rule of probability.. So far we have been quite careful to make a distinction between a random vari-. able, such as the box B in the fruit example, and the values that the random variable. can take, for example r if the box were the red one. Thus the probability that B takes. the value r is denoted p(B = r). Although this helps to avoid ambiguity, it leads. to a rather cumbersome notation, and in many cases there will be no need for such. pedantry. Instead, we may simply write p(B) to denote a distribution over the ran-. dom variable B, or p(r) to denote the distribution evaluated for the particular value. r, provided that the interpretation is clear from the context.. With this more compact notation, we can write the two fundamental rules of. probability theory in the following form.. The Rules of Probability. sum rule. p(X) =. p(X, Y ). Y. product rule. p(X, Y ) = p(Y |X)p(X).. (1.10). (1.11). Here p(X, Y ) is a joint probability and is verbalized as “the probability of X and. Y ”. Similarly, the quantity p(Y |X) is a conditional probability and is verbalized as. “the probability of Y given X”, whereas the quantity p(X) is a marginal probability. and is simply “the probability of X”. These two simple rules form the basis for all. of the probabilistic machinery that we use throughout this book.. From the product rule, together with the symmetry property p(X, Y ) = p(Y, X),. we immediately obtain the following relationship between conditional probabilities. p(Y |X) = p(X|Y )p(Y ). p(X). (1.12). 1.2. Probability Theory. 15. which is called Bayes’ theorem and which plays a central role in pattern recognition. and machine learning. Using the sum rule, the denominator in Bayes’ theorem can. be expressed in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator. p(X) =. p(X|Y )p(Y ).. Y. (1.13). We can view the denominator in Bayes’ theorem as being the normalization constant. required to ensure that the sum of the conditional probability on the left-hand side of. (1.12) over all values of Y equals one.. In Figure 1.11, we show a simple example involving a joint distribution over two. variables to illustrate the concept of marginal and conditional distributions. Here. a finite sample of N = 60 data points has been drawn from the joint distribution. and is shown in the top left. In the top right is a histogram of the fractions of data. points having each of the two values of Y . From the definition of probability, these. fractions would equal the corresponding probabilities p(Y ) in the limit N → ∞. We. can view the histogram as a simple way to model a probability distribution given only. a finite number of points drawn from that distribution. Modelling distributions from. data lies at the heart of statistical pattern recognition and will be explored in great. detail in this book. The remaining two plots in Figure 1.11 show the corresponding. histogram estimates of p(X) and p(X|Y = 1).. Let us now return to our example involving boxes of fruit. For the moment, we. shall once again be explicit about distinguishing between the random variables and. their instantiations. We have seen that the probabilities of selecting either the red or. the blue boxes are given by. p(B = r) = 4/10. p(B = b) = 6/10. (1.14). (1.15). respectively. Note that these satisfy p(B = r) + p(B = b) = 1.. Now suppose that we pick a box at random, and it turns out to be the blue box.. Then the probability of selecting an apple is just the fraction of apples in the blue. box which is 3/4, and so p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4. In fact, we can write out all four. conditional probabilities for the type of fruit, given the selected box. p(F = a|B = r) = 1/4. p(F = o|B = r) = 3/4. p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4. p(F = o|B = b) = 1/4..

Figure 1.11 An illustration of a distribution over two variables, X, which takes 9 possible values, and Y , which. takes two possible values. The top left figure shows a sample of 60 points drawn from a joint probability distri-. bution over these variables. The remaining figures show histogram estimates of the marginal distributions p(X). and p(Y ), as well as the conditional distribution p(X|Y = 1) corresponding to the bottom row in the top left. figure.. Again, note that these probabilities are normalized so that. p(F = a|B = r) + p(F = o|B = r) = 1. and similarly. p(F = a|B = b) + p(F = o|B = b) = 1.. We can now use the sum and product rules of probability to evaluate the overall. probability of choosing an apple. (1.20). (1.21). (1.22). p(F = a) = p(F = a|B = r)p(B = r) + p(F = a|B = b)p(B = b). 1. 4 ×. 4. 10. 3. 4 ×. 6. 10. 11. 20. from which it follows, using the sum rule, that p(F = o) = 1 − 11/20 = 9/20.. 1.2. Probability Theory. 17. Suppose instead we are told that a piece of fruit has been selected and it is an. orange, and we would like to know which box it came from. This requires that. we evaluate the probability distribution over boxes conditioned on the identity of. the fruit, whereas the probabilities in (1.16)–(1.19) give the probability distribution. over the fruit conditioned on the identity of the box. We can solve the problem of. reversing the conditional probability by using Bayes’ theorem to give. 3. 4 ×. 4. 10 ×. 20. 9. (1.23). p(F = o). p(B = r|F = o) = p(F = o|B = r)p(B = r). 2. 3 .. From the sum rule, it then follows that p(B = b|F = o) = 1 − 2/3 = 1/3.. We can provide an important interpretation of Bayes’ theorem as follows. If. we had been asked which box had been chosen before being told the identity of. the selected item of fruit, then the most complete information we have available is. provided by the probability p(B). We call this the prior probability because it is the. probability available before we observe the identity of the fruit. Once we are told that. the fruit is an orange, we can then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability. p(B|F ), which we shall call the posterior probability because it is the probability. obtained after we have observed F . Note that in this example, the prior probability. of selecting the red box was 4/10, so that we were more likely to select the blue box. than the red one. However, once we have observed that the piece of selected fruit is. an orange, we find that the posterior probability of the red box is now 2/3, so that. it is now more likely that the box we selected was in fact the red one. This result. accords with our intuition, as the proportion of oranges is much higher in the red box. than it is in the blue box, and so the observation that the fruit was an orange provides. significant evidence favouring the red box. In fact, the evidence is sufficiently strong. that it outweighs the prior and makes it more likely that the red box was chosen. rather than the blue one.. Finally, we note that if the joint distribution of two variables factorizes into the. product of the marginals, so that p(X, Y ) = p(X)p(Y ), then X and Y are said to. be independent. From the product rule, we see that p(Y |X) = p(Y ), and so the. conditional distribution of Y given X is indeed independent of the value of X. For. instance, in our boxes of fruit example, if each box contained the same fraction of. apples and oranges, then p(F|B) = P (F ), so that the probability of selecting, say,. an apple is independent of which box is chosen.. "
3,1.2.1,Probability densities,"As well as considering probabilities defined over discrete sets of events, we. also wish to consider probabilities with respect to continuous variables. We shall. limit ourselves to a relatively informal discussion. If the probability of a real-valued. variable x falling in the interval (x, x + δx) is given by p(x)δx for δx → 0, then. p(x) is called the probability density over x. This is illustrated in Figure 1.12. The. probability that x will lie in an interval (a, b) is then given by. p(x ∈ (a, b)) =. b. a. p(x) dx.. (1.24).  dx. dy. 18. 1. INTRODUCTION. Figure 1.12 The concept of probability for. discrete variables can be ex-. tended to that of a probability. density p(x) over a continuous. variable x and is such that the. probability of x lying in the inter-. val (x, x + δx) is given by p(x)δx. for δx → 0. The probability. density can be expressed as the. derivative of a cumulative distri-. bution function P (x).. p(x). P (x). x. (1.25). (1.26). δx. p(x) � 0. p(x) dx = 1.. Because probabilities are nonnegative, and because the value of x must lie some-. where on the real axis, the probability density p(x) must satisfy the two conditions. Under a nonlinear change of variable, a probability density transforms differently. from a simple function, due to the Jacobian factor. For instance, if we consider. f(y) = f(g(y)).. a change of variables x = g(y), then a function f(x) becomes. Now consider a probability density px(x) that corresponds to a density py(y) with. respect to the new variable y, where the suffices denote the fact that px(x) and py(y). are different densities. Observations falling in the range (x, x + δx) will, for small. values of δx, be transformed into the range (y, y + δy) where px(x)δx  py(y)δy,. and hence. py(y) = px(x). = px(g(y))|g(y)| .. (1.27). One consequence of this property is that the concept of the maximum of a probability. density is dependent on the choice of variable.. The probability that x lies in the interval (−∞, z) is given by the cumulative. distribution function defined by. P (z) =. p(x) dx. z. (1.28). which satisfies P (x) = p(x), as shown in Figure 1.12.. If we have several continuous variables x1, . . . , xD, denoted collectively by the. vector x, then we can define a joint probability density p(x) = p(x1, . . . , xD) such. Exercise 1.4. x. (1.29). (1.30). (1.31). (1.32). 1.2. Probability Theory. 19. that the probability of x falling in an infinitesimal volume δx containing the point x. is given by p(x)δx. This multivariate probability density must satisfy. p(x) � 0. p(x) dx = 1. in which the integral is taken over the whole of x space. We can also consider joint. probability distributions over a combination of discrete and continuous variables.. Note that if x is a discrete variable, then p(x) is sometimes called a probability. mass function because it can be regarded as a set of ‘probability masses’ concentrated. at the allowed values of x.. The sum and product rules of probability, as well as Bayes’ theorem, apply. equally to the case of probability densities, or to combinations of discrete and con-. tinuous variables. For instance, if x and y are two real variables, then the sum and. product rules take the form. p(x) =. p(x, y) dy. p(x, y) = p(y|x)p(x).. A formal justification of the sum and product rules for continuous variables (Feller,. 1966) requires a branch of mathematics called measure theory and lies outside the. scope of this book. Its validity can be seen informally, however, by dividing each. real variable into intervals of width ∆ and considering the discrete probability dis-. tribution over these intervals. Taking the limit ∆ → 0 then turns sums into integrals. and gives the desired result.. "
4,1.2.2,Expectations and covariances,"One of the most important operations involving probabilities is that of finding. weighted averages of functions. The average value of some function f(x) under a. probability distribution p(x) is called the expectation of f(x) and will be denoted by. E[f]. For a discrete distribution, it is given by. E[f] =. p(x)f(x). (1.33). so that the average is weighted by the relative probabilities of the different values. of x. In the case of continuous variables, expectations are expressed in terms of an. integration with respect to the corresponding probability density. E[f] =. p(x)f(x) dx.. (1.34). In either case, if we are given a finite number N of points drawn from the probability. distribution or probability density, then the expectation can be approximated as a. n=1. N. 20. 1. INTRODUCTION. finite sum over these points. E[f] . 1. N. f(xn).. (1.35). We shall make extensive use of this result when we discuss sampling methods in. Chapter 11. The approximation in (1.35) becomes exact in the limit N → ∞.. Sometimes we will be considering expectations of functions of several variables,. in which case we can use a subscript to indicate which variable is being averaged. over, so that for instance. (1.36). denotes the average of the function f(x, y) with respect to the distribution of x. Note. that Ex[f(x, y)] will be a function of y.. Ex[f(x, y)]. We can also consider a conditional expectation with respect to a conditional. distribution, so that. p(x|y)f(x). with an analogous definition for continuous variables.. Ex[f|y] =. x. The variance of f(x) is defined by. var[f] = E. (f(x) − E[f(x)])2. and provides a measure of how much variability there is in f(x) around its mean. value E[f(x)]. Expanding out the square, we see that the variance can also be written. in terms of the expectations of f(x) and f(x)2. In particular, we can consider the variance of the variable x itself, which is given by. var[f] = E[f(x)2] − E[f(x)]2.. var[x] = E[x2] − E[x]2.. For two random variables x and y, the covariance is defined by. cov[x, y] = Ex,y [{x − E[x]}{y − E[y]}]. = Ex,y[xy] − E[x]E[y]. which expresses the extent to which x and y vary together. If x and y are indepen-. dent, then their covariance vanishes.. In the case of two vectors of random variables x and y, the covariance is a matrix. cov[x, y] = Ex,y. {x − E[x]}{yT − E[yT]}. = Ex,y[xyT] − E[x]E[yT].. (1.42). If we consider the covariance of the components of a vector x with each other, then. we use a slightly simpler notation cov[x] ≡ cov[x, x].. (1.37). (1.38). (1.39). (1.40). (1.41). Exercise 1.5.

5,1.2.3,Bayesian probabilities,"So far in this chapter, we have viewed probabilities in terms of the frequencies. of random, repeatable events. We shall refer to this as the classical or frequentist. interpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in. which probabilities provide a quantification of uncertainty.. Consider an uncertain event, for example whether the moon was once in its own. orbit around the sun, or whether the Arctic ice cap will have disappeared by the end. of the century. These are not events that can be repeated numerous times in order. to define a notion of probability as we did earlier in the context of boxes of fruit.. Nevertheless, we will generally have some idea, for example, of how quickly we. think the polar ice is melting. If we now obtain fresh evidence, for instance from a. new Earth observation satellite gathering novel forms of diagnostic information, we. may revise our opinion on the rate of ice loss. Our assessment of such matters will. affect the actions we take, for instance the extent to which we endeavour to reduce. the emission of greenhouse gasses. In such circumstances, we would like to be able. to quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of uncertainty in. the light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions. or decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very. general, Bayesian interpretation of probability.. The use of probability to represent uncertainty, however, is not an ad-hoc choice,. but is inevitable if we are to respect common sense while making rational coherent. inferences. For instance, Cox (1946) showed that if numerical values are used to. represent degrees of belief, then a simple set of axioms encoding common sense. properties of such beliefs leads uniquely to a set of rules for manipulating degrees of. belief that are equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability. This provided. the first rigorous proof that probability theory could be regarded as an extension of. Boolean logic to situations involving uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003). Numerous other. authors have proposed different sets of properties or axioms that such measures of. uncertainty should satisfy (Ramsey, 1931; Good, 1950; Savage, 1961; deFinetti,. 1970; Lindley, 1982). In each case, the resulting numerical quantities behave pre-. cisely according to the rules of probability. It is therefore natural to refer to these. quantities as (Bayesian) probabilities.. In the field of pattern recognition, too, it is helpful to have a more general no-. Thomas Bayes. 1701–1761. Thomas Bayes was born in Tun-. bridge Wells and was a clergyman. as well as an amateur scientist and. a mathematician. He studied logic. and theology at Edinburgh Univer-. sity and was elected Fellow of the. Royal Society in 1742. During the 18th century, is-. sues regarding probability arose in connection with. gambling and with the new concept of insurance. One. particularly important problem concerned so-called in-. verse probability. A solution was proposed by Thomas. Bayes in his paper ‘Essay towards solving a problem. in the doctrine of chances’, which was published in. 1764, some three years after his death, in the Philo-. sophical Transactions of the Royal Society.. In fact,. Bayes only formulated his theory for the case of a uni-. form prior, and it was Pierre-Simon Laplace who inde-. pendently rediscovered the theory in general form and. who demonstrated its broad applicability.. 22. 1. INTRODUCTION. tion of probability. Consider the example of polynomial curve fitting discussed in. Section 1.1. It seems reasonable to apply the frequentist notion of probability to the. random values of the observed variables tn. However, we would like to address and. quantify the uncertainty that surrounds the appropriate choice for the model param-. eters w. We shall see that, from a Bayesian perspective, we can use the machinery. of probability theory to describe the uncertainty in model parameters such as w, or. indeed in the choice of model itself.. Bayes’ theorem now acquires a new significance. Recall that in the boxes of fruit. example, the observation of the identity of the fruit provided relevant information. that altered the probability that the chosen box was the red one. In that example,. Bayes’ theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability. by incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data. As we shall see in. detail later, we can adopt a similar approach when making inferences about quantities. such as the parameters w in the polynomial curve fitting example. We capture our. assumptions about w, before observing the data, in the form of a prior probability. distribution p(w). The effect of the observed data D = {t1, . . . , tN} is expressed. through the conditional probability p(D|w), and we shall see later, in Section 1.2.5,. how this can be represented explicitly. Bayes’ theorem, which takes the form. p(w|D) = p(D|w)p(w). p(D). (1.43). then allows us to evaluate the uncertainty in w after we have observed D in the form. of the posterior probability p(w|D).. The quantity p(D|w) on the right-hand side of Bayes’ theorem is evaluated for. the observed data set D and can be viewed as a function of the parameter vector. w, in which case it is called the likelihood function. It expresses how probable the. observed data set is for different settings of the parameter vector w. Note that the. likelihood is not a probability distribution over w, and its integral with respect to w. does not (necessarily) equal one.. Given this definition of likelihood, we can state Bayes’ theorem in words. posterior ∝ likelihood × prior. (1.44). where all of these quantities are viewed as functions of w. The denominator in. (1.43) is the normalization constant, which ensures that the posterior distribution. on the left-hand side is a valid probability density and integrates to one. Indeed,. integrating both sides of (1.43) with respect to w, we can express the denominator. in Bayes’ theorem in terms of the prior distribution and the likelihood function. p(D) =. p(D|w)p(w) dw.. (1.45). In both the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms, the likelihood function p(D|w). plays a central role. However, the manner in which it is used is fundamentally dif-. ferent in the two approaches. In a frequentist setting, w is considered to be a fixed. parameter, whose value is determined by some form of ‘estimator’, and error bars. 1.2. Probability Theory. 23. on this estimate are obtained by considering the distribution of possible data sets D.. By contrast, from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely. the one that is actually observed), and the uncertainty in the parameters is expressed. through a probability distribution over w.. A widely used frequentist estimator is maximum likelihood, in which w is set. to the value that maximizes the likelihood function p(D|w). This corresponds to. choosing the value of w for which the probability of the observed data set is maxi-. mized. In the machine learning literature, the negative log of the likelihood function. is called an error function. Because the negative logarithm is a monotonically de-. creasing function, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the error.. One approach to determining frequentist error bars is the bootstrap (Efron, 1979;. Hastie et al., 2001), in which multiple data sets are created as follows. Suppose our. original data set consists of N data points X = {x1, . . . , xN}. We can create a new. data set XB by drawing N points at random from X, with replacement, so that some. points in X may be replicated in XB, whereas other points in X may be absent from. XB. This process can be repeated L times to generate L data sets each of size N and. each obtained by sampling from the original data set X. The statistical accuracy of. parameter estimates can then be evaluated by looking at the variability of predictions. between the different bootstrap data sets.. One advantage of the Bayesian viewpoint is that the inclusion of prior knowl-. edge arises naturally. Suppose, for instance, that a fair-looking coin is tossed three. times and lands heads each time. A classical maximum likelihood estimate of the. probability of landing heads would give 1, implying that all future tosses will land. heads! By contrast, a Bayesian approach with any reasonable prior will lead to a. much less extreme conclusion.. There has been much controversy and debate associated with the relative mer-. its of the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, which have not been helped by the. fact that there is no unique frequentist, or even Bayesian, viewpoint. For instance,. one common criticism of the Bayesian approach is that the prior distribution is of-. ten selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rather than as a reflection of. any prior beliefs. Even the subjective nature of the conclusions through their de-. pendence on the choice of prior is seen by some as a source of difficulty. Reducing. the dependence on the prior is one motivation for so-called noninformative priors.. However, these lead to difficulties when comparing different models, and indeed. Bayesian methods based on poor choices of prior can give poor results with high. confidence. Frequentist evaluation methods offer some protection from such prob-. lems, and techniques such as cross-validation remain useful in areas such as model. comparison.. This book places a strong emphasis on the Bayesian viewpoint, reflecting the. huge growth in the practical importance of Bayesian methods in the past few years,. while also discussing useful frequentist concepts as required.. Although the Bayesian framework has its origins in the 18th century, the prac-. tical application of Bayesian methods was for a long time severely limited by the. difficulties in carrying through the full Bayesian procedure, particularly the need to. marginalize (sum or integrate) over the whole of parameter space, which, as we shall. Section 2.1. Section 2.4.3. Section 1.3. 24. 1. INTRODUCTION. see, is required in order to make predictions or to compare different models. The. development of sampling methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (discussed in. Chapter 11) along with dramatic improvements in the speed and memory capacity. of computers, opened the door to the practical use of Bayesian techniques in an im-. pressive range of problem domains. Monte Carlo methods are very flexible and can. be applied to a wide range of models. However, they are computationally intensive. and have mainly been used for small-scale problems.. More recently, highly efficient deterministic approximation schemes such as. variational Bayes and expectation propagation (discussed in Chapter 10) have been. developed. These offer a complementary alternative to sampling methods and have. allowed Bayesian techniques to be used in large-scale applications (Blei et al., 2003).. "
6,1.2.4,The Gaussian distribution,"We shall devote the whole of Chapter 2 to a study of various probability dis-. tributions and their key properties. It is convenient, however, to introduce here one. of the most important probability distributions for continuous variables, called the. normal or Gaussian distribution. We shall make extensive use of this distribution in. the remainder of this chapter and indeed throughout much of the book.. For the case of a single real-valued variable x, the Gaussian distribution is de-. fined by. N. x|µ, σ2. 1. (2πσ2)1/2. exp. 1. 2σ2 (x − µ)2. (1.46). which is governed by two parameters: µ, called the mean, and σ2, called the vari-. ance. The square root of the variance, given by σ, is called the standard deviation,. and the reciprocal of the variance, written as β = 1/σ2, is called the precision. We. shall see the motivation for these terms shortly. Figure 1.13 shows a plot of the. Gaussian distribution.. From the form of (1.46) we see that the Gaussian distribution satisfies. N (x|µ, σ2) > 0.. (1.47). Exercise 1.7. Also it is straightforward to show that the Gaussian is normalized, so that. Pierre-Simon Laplace. 1749–1827. It. is said that Laplace was seri-. ously lacking in modesty and at one. point declared himself. to be the. best mathematician in France at the. time, a claim that was arguably true.. As well as being prolific in mathe-. matics, he also made numerous contributions to as-. tronomy, including the nebular hypothesis by which the. earth is thought to have formed from the condensa-. tion and cooling of a large rotating disk of gas and. dust. In 1812 he published the first edition of Th´eorie. Analytique des Probabilit´es, in which Laplace states. that “probability theory is nothing but common sense. reduced to calculation”. This work included a discus-. sion of the inverse probability calculation (later termed. Bayes’ theorem by Poincar´e), which he used to solve. problems in life expectancy, jurisprudence, planetary. masses, triangulation, and error estimation.. 2σ. 25. x. (1.48). (1.49). (1.50). (1.51).

Thus (1.46) satisfies the two requirements for a valid probability density.. We can readily find expectations of functions of x under the Gaussian distribu-. tion. In particular, the average value of x is given by. E[x] =. N. x|µ, σ2. x dx = µ.. Because the parameter µ represents the average value of x under the distribution, it. is referred to as the mean. Similarly, for the second order moment. E[x2] =. N. x|µ, σ2. x2 dx = µ2 + σ2.. From (1.49) and (1.50), it follows that the variance of x is given by. var[x] = E[x2] − E[x]2 = σ2. and hence σ2 is referred to as the variance parameter. The maximum of a distribution. is known as its mode. For a Gaussian, the mode coincides with the mean.. We are also interested in the Gaussian distribution defined over a D-dimensional. vector x of continuous variables, which is given by. N (x|µ, Σ) =. 1. 1. (2π)D/2. |Σ|1/2. exp. 1. 2. (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ). (1.52). where the D-dimensional vector µ is called the mean, the D × D matrix Σ is called. the covariance, and |Σ| denotes the determinant of Σ. We shall make use of the. multivariate Gaussian distribution briefly in this chapter, although its properties will. be studied in detail in Section 2.3.. 26. 1. INTRODUCTION. Figure 1.14 Illustration of the likelihood function for. a Gaussian distribution, shown by the. red curve. Here the black points de-. note a data set of values {xn}, and. the likelihood function given by (1.53). corresponds to the product of the blue. values.

Now suppose that we have a data set of observations x = (x1, . . . , xN )T, rep-. resenting N observations of the scalar variable x. Note that we are using the type-. face x to distinguish this from a single observation of the vector-valued variable. (x1, . . . , xD)T, which we denote by x. We shall suppose that the observations are. drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution whose mean µ and variance σ2. are unknown, and we would like to determine these parameters from the data set.. Data points that are drawn independently from the same distribution are said to be. independent and identically distributed, which is often abbreviated to i.i.d. We have. seen that the joint probability of two independent events is given by the product of. the marginal probabilities for each event separately. Because our data set x is i.i.d.,. we can therefore write the probability of the data set, given µ and σ2, in the form. Section 1.2.5. p(x|µ, σ2) =. N. xn|µ, σ2. n=1. (1.53). When viewed as a function of µ and σ2, this is the likelihood function for the Gaus-. sian and is interpreted diagrammatically in Figure 1.14.. One common criterion for determining the parameters in a probability distribu-. tion using an observed data set is to find the parameter values that maximize the. likelihood function. This might seem like a strange criterion because, from our fore-. going discussion of probability theory, it would seem more natural to maximize the. probability of the parameters given the data, not the probability of the data given the. parameters. In fact, these two criteria are related, as we shall discuss in the context. of curve fitting.. For the moment, however, we shall determine values for the unknown parame-. ters µ and σ2 in the Gaussian by maximizing the likelihood function (1.53). In prac-. tice, it is more convenient to maximize the log of the likelihood function. Because. the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function of its argument, maximization. of the log of a function is equivalent to maximization of the function itself. Taking. the log not only simplifies the subsequent mathematical analysis, but it also helps. numerically because the product of a large number of small probabilities can easily. underflow the numerical precision of the computer, and this is resolved by computing. instead the sum of the log probabilities. From (1.46) and (1.53), the log likelihood. N. n=1. 1. N. n=1. N. N − 1. N. N. 2. xn. n=1. N. N. Exercise 1.11. Section 1.1. Exercise 1.12. 1.2.

Maximizing (1.54) with respect to µ, we obtain the maximum likelihood solution. given by. µML =. (1.55). (1.56). which is the sample mean, i.e., the mean of the observed values {xn}. Similarly,. maximizing (1.54) with respect to σ2, we obtain the maximum likelihood solution. for the variance in the form. ML =. σ2. 1. N. (xn − µML)2. which is the sample variance measured with respect to the sample mean µML. Note. that we are performing a joint maximization of (1.54) with respect to µ and σ2, but. in the case of the Gaussian distribution the solution for µ decouples from that for σ2. so that we can first evaluate (1.55) and then subsequently use this result to evaluate. (1.56).. Later in this chapter, and also in subsequent chapters, we shall highlight the sig-. nificant limitations of the maximum likelihood approach. Here we give an indication. of the problem in the context of our solutions for the maximum likelihood param-. eter settings for the univariate Gaussian distribution. In particular, we shall show. that the maximum likelihood approach systematically underestimates the variance. of the distribution. This is an example of a phenomenon called bias and is related. to the problem of over-fitting encountered in the context of polynomial curve fitting.. We first note that the maximum likelihood solutions µML and σ2. ML are functions of. the data set values x1, . . . , xN . Consider the expectations of these quantities with. respect to the data set values, which themselves come from a Gaussian distribution. with parameters µ and σ2. It is straightforward to show that. E[µML] = µ. E[σ2. ML] =. σ2. (1.57). (1.58). so that on average the maximum likelihood estimate will obtain the correct mean but. will underestimate the true variance by a factor (N − 1)/N. The intuition behind. this result is given by Figure 1.15.. From (1.58) it follows that the following estimate for the variance parameter is. unbiased. σ2 = N. ML =. N − 1 σ2. 1. N − 1. n=1.

The green curve shows. the true Gaussian distribution from which. data is generated, and the three red curves. show the Gaussian distributions obtained. by fitting to three data sets, each consist-. ing of two data points shown in blue, us-. ing the maximum likelihood results (1.55). and (1.56). Averaged across the three data. sets, the mean is correct, but the variance. is systematically under-estimated because. it is measured relative to the sample mean. and not relative to the true mean.. (a). (b). (c). Section 1.1. In Section 10.1.3, we shall see how this result arises automatically when we adopt a. Bayesian approach.. Note that the bias of the maximum likelihood solution becomes less significant. as the number N of data points increases, and in the limit N → ∞ the maximum. likelihood solution for the variance equals the true variance of the distribution that. generated the data. In practice, for anything other than small N, this bias will not. prove to be a serious problem. However, throughout this book we shall be interested. in more complex models with many parameters, for which the bias problems asso-. ciated with maximum likelihood will be much more severe. In fact, as we shall see,. the issue of bias in maximum likelihood lies at the root of the over-fitting problem. that we encountered earlier in the context of polynomial curve fitting.. "
7,1.2.5,Curve fitting re-visited,"We have seen how the problem of polynomial curve fitting can be expressed in. terms of error minimization. Here we return to the curve fitting example and view it. from a probabilistic perspective, thereby gaining some insights into error functions. and regularization, as well as taking us towards a full Bayesian treatment.. The goal in the curve fitting problem is to be able to make predictions for the. target variable t given some new value of the input variable x on the basis of a set of. training data comprising N input values x = (x1, . . . , xN )T and their corresponding. target values t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. We can express our uncertainty over the value of. the target variable using a probability distribution. For this purpose, we shall assume. that, given the value of x, the corresponding value of t has a Gaussian distribution. with a mean equal to the value y(x, w) of the polynomial curve given by (1.1). Thus. we have. where, for consistency with the notation in later chapters, we have defined a preci-. sion parameter β corresponding to the inverse variance of the distribution. This is. illustrated schematically in Figure 1.16.. p(t|x, w, β) = N. t|y(x, w), β−1. (1.60). N. n=1. t. N. N. n=1. Figure 1.16 Schematic illustration of a Gaus-. sian conditional distribution for t given x given by.

Probability Theory. 29. y(x, w). p(t|x0, w, β). 2σ. x. x0. We now use the training data {x, t} to determine the values of the unknown. parameters w and β by maximum likelihood. If the data are assumed to be drawn. independently from the distribution (1.60), then the likelihood function is given by. p(t|x, w, β) =. N. tn|y(xn, w), β−1. (1.61). As we did in the case of the simple Gaussian distribution earlier, it is convenient to. maximize the logarithm of the likelihood function. Substituting for the form of the. Gaussian distribution, given by (1.46), we obtain the log likelihood function in the. form. ln p(t|x, w, β) = −. 2. {y(xn, w) − tn}2 + N. 2. ln β −. N. 2. ln(2π).. (1.62). Consider first the determination of the maximum likelihood solution for the polyno-. mial coefficients, which will be denoted by wML. These are determined by maxi-. mizing (1.62) with respect to w. For this purpose, we can omit the last two terms. on the right-hand side of (1.62) because they do not depend on w. Also, we note. that scaling the log likelihood by a positive constant coefficient does not alter the. location of the maximum with respect to w, and so we can replace the coefficient. β/2 with 1/2. Finally, instead of maximizing the log likelihood, we can equivalently. minimize the negative log likelihood. We therefore see that maximizing likelihood is. equivalent, so far as determining w is concerned, to minimizing the sum-of-squares. error function defined by (1.2). Thus the sum-of-squares error function has arisen as. a consequence of maximizing likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian noise. distribution.. We can also use maximum likelihood to determine the precision parameter β of. the Gaussian conditional distribution. Maximizing (1.62) with respect to β gives. 1. βML. 1. N. {y(xn, wML) − tn}2 .. n=1. (1.63). N. n=1. 30. 1. INTRODUCTION. Section 1.2.4. Again we can first determine the parameter vector wML governing the mean and sub-. sequently use this to find the precision βML as was the case for the simple Gaussian. distribution.. Having determined the parameters w and β, we can now make predictions for. new values of x. Because we now have a probabilistic model, these are expressed. in terms of the predictive distribution that gives the probability distribution over t,. rather than simply a point estimate, and is obtained by substituting the maximum. likelihood parameters into (1.60) to give. p(t|x, wML, βML) = N. t|y(x, wML), β−1. (1.64). ML. Now let us take a step towards a more Bayesian approach and introduce a prior. distribution over the polynomial coefficients w. For simplicity, let us consider a. Gaussian distribution of the form. p(w|α) = N (w|0, α−1I) =. 2π. (M +1)/2. exp. 2. wTw. (1.65). where α is the precision of the distribution, and M +1 is the total number of elements. in the vector w for an M th order polynomial. Variables such as α, which control. the distribution of model parameters, are called hyperparameters. Using Bayes’. theorem, the posterior distribution for w is proportional to the product of the prior. distribution and the likelihood function. p(w|x, t, α, β) ∝ p(t|x, w, β)p(w|α).. (1.66). We can now determine w by finding the most probable value of w given the data,. in other words by maximizing the posterior distribution. This technique is called. maximum posterior, or simply MAP. Taking the negative logarithm of (1.66) and. combining with (1.62) and (1.65), we find that the maximum of the posterior is. given by the minimum of. 2. {y(xn, w) − tn}2 + α. 2. wTw.. (1.67). Thus we see that maximizing the posterior distribution is equivalent to minimizing. the regularized sum-of-squares error function encountered earlier in the form (1.4),. with a regularization parameter given by λ = α/β.. "
8,1.2.6,Bayesian curve fitting,"Although we have included a prior distribution p(w|α), we are so far still mak-. ing a point estimate of w and so this does not yet amount to a Bayesian treatment. In. a fully Bayesian approach, we should consistently apply the sum and product rules. of probability, which requires, as we shall see shortly, that we integrate over all val-. ues of w. Such marginalizations lie at the heart of Bayesian methods for pattern. recognition.. N. N. 1.2. Probability Theory. 31. In the curve fitting problem, we are given the training data x and t, along with. a new test point x, and our goal is to predict the value of t. We therefore wish. to evaluate the predictive distribution p(t|x, x, t). Here we shall assume that the. parameters α and β are fixed and known in advance (in later chapters we shall discuss. how such parameters can be inferred from data in a Bayesian setting).. A Bayesian treatment simply corresponds to a consistent application of the sum. and product rules of probability, which allow the predictive distribution to be written. in the form. p(t|x, x, t) =. p(t|x, w)p(w|x, t) dw.. (1.68). Here p(t|x, w) is given by (1.60), and we have omitted the dependence on α and. β to simplify the notation. Here p(w|x, t) is the posterior distribution over param-. eters, and can be found by normalizing the right-hand side of (1.66). We shall see. in Section 3.3 that, for problems such as the curve-fitting example, this posterior. distribution is a Gaussian and can be evaluated analytically. Similarly, the integra-. tion in (1.68) can also be performed analytically with the result that the predictive. distribution is given by a Gaussian of the form. p(t|x, x, t) = N. where the mean and variance are given by. t|m(x), s2(x). Here the matrix S is given by. m(x) = βφ(x)TS. φ(xn)tn. n=1. s2(x) = β−1 + φ(x)TSφ(x).. S−1 = αI + β. φ(xn)φ(x)T. n=1. where I is the unit matrix, and we have defined the vector φ(x) with elements. φi(x) = xi for i = 0, . . . , M.. We see that the variance, as well as the mean, of the predictive distribution in. (1.69) is dependent on x. The first term in (1.71) represents the uncertainty in the. predicted value of t due to the noise on the target variables and was expressed already. in the maximum likelihood predictive distribution (1.64) through β−1. ML. However, the. second term arises from the uncertainty in the parameters w and is a consequence. of the Bayesian treatment. The predictive distribution for the synthetic sinusoidal. regression problem is illustrated in Figure 1.17.. (1.69). (1.70). (1.71). (1.72). 32. 1. INTRODUCTION.

9,1.3,Model Selection,"1. x. In our example of polynomial curve fitting using least squares, we saw that there was. an optimal order of polynomial that gave the best generalization. The order of the. polynomial controls the number of free parameters in the model and thereby governs. the model complexity. With regularized least squares, the regularization coefficient. λ also controls the effective complexity of the model, whereas for more complex. models, such as mixture distributions or neural networks there may be multiple pa-. rameters governing complexity.. In a practical application, we need to determine. the values of such parameters, and the principal objective in doing so is usually to. achieve the best predictive performance on new data. Furthermore, as well as find-. ing the appropriate values for complexity parameters within a given model, we may. wish to consider a range of different types of model in order to find the best one for. our particular application.. We have already seen that, in the maximum likelihood approach, the perfor-. mance on the training set is not a good indicator of predictive performance on un-. seen data due to the problem of over-fitting. If data is plentiful, then one approach is. simply to use some of the available data to train a range of models, or a given model. with a range of values for its complexity parameters, and then to compare them on. independent data, sometimes called a validation set, and select the one having the. best predictive performance. If the model design is iterated many times using a lim-. ited size data set, then some over-fitting to the validation data can occur and so it may. be necessary to keep aside a third test set on which the performance of the selected. model is finally evaluated.. In many applications, however, the supply of data for training and testing will be. limited, and in order to build good models, we wish to use as much of the available. data as possible for training. However, if the validation set is small, it will give a. relatively noisy estimate of predictive performance. One solution to this dilemma is. to use cross-validation, which is illustrated in Figure 1.18. This allows a proportion. (S − 1)/S of the available data to be used for training while making use of all of the. "
10,1.4,The Curse of Dimensionality,"33. Figure 1.18 The technique of S-fold cross-validation,. illus-. trated here for the case of S = 4, involves tak-. ing the available data and partitioning it into S. groups (in the simplest case these are of equal. size). Then S − 1 of the groups are used to train. a set of models that are then evaluated on the re-. maining group. This procedure is then repeated. for all S possible choices for the held-out group,. indicated here by the red blocks, and the perfor-. mance scores from the S runs are then averaged.. run 1. run 2. run 3. run 4. data to assess performance. When data is particularly scarce, it may be appropriate. to consider the case S = N, where N is the total number of data points, which gives. the leave-one-out technique.. One major drawback of cross-validation is that the number of training runs that. must be performed is increased by a factor of S, and this can prove problematic for. models in which the training is itself computationally expensive. A further problem. with techniques such as cross-validation that use separate data to assess performance. is that we might have multiple complexity parameters for a single model (for in-. stance, there might be several regularization parameters). Exploring combinations. of settings for such parameters could, in the worst case, require a number of training. runs that is exponential in the number of parameters. Clearly, we need a better ap-. proach. Ideally, this should rely only on the training data and should allow multiple. hyperparameters and model types to be compared in a single training run. We there-. fore need to find a measure of performance which depends only on the training data. and which does not suffer from bias due to over-fitting.. Historically various ‘information criteria’ have been proposed that attempt to. correct for the bias of maximum likelihood by the addition of a penalty term to. compensate for the over-fitting of more complex models. For example, the Akaike. information criterion, or AIC (Akaike, 1974), chooses the model for which the quan-. tity. ln p(D|wML) − M. (1.73). is largest. Here p(D|wML) is the best-fit log likelihood, and M is the number of. adjustable parameters in the model. A variant of this quantity, called the Bayesian. information criterion, or BIC, will be discussed in Section 4.4.1. Such criteria do. not take account of the uncertainty in the model parameters, however, and in practice. they tend to favour overly simple models. We therefore turn in Section 3.4 to a fully. Bayesian approach where we shall see how complexity penalties arise in a natural. and principled way.. 1.4. The Curse of Dimensionality. In the polynomial curve fitting example we had just one input variable x. For prac-. tical applications of pattern recognition, however, we will have to deal with spaces. 34. 1. INTRODUCTION. Figure 1.19 Scatter plot of the oil flow data. for input variables x6 and x7, in. which red denotes the ‘homoge-. nous’ class, green denotes the. ‘annular’ class, and blue denotes. the ‘laminar’ class.

As we now discuss, this. poses some serious challenges and is an important factor influencing the design of. pattern recognition techniques.. In order to illustrate the problem we consider a synthetically generated data set. representing measurements taken from a pipeline containing a mixture of oil, wa-. ter, and gas (Bishop and James, 1993). These three materials can be present in one. of three different geometrical configurations known as ‘homogenous’, ‘annular’, and. ‘laminar’, and the fractions of the three materials can also vary. Each data point com-. prises a 12-dimensional input vector consisting of measurements taken with gamma. ray densitometers that measure the attenuation of gamma rays passing along nar-. row beams through the pipe. This data set is described in detail in Appendix A.. Figure 1.19 shows 100 points from this data set on a plot showing two of the mea-. surements x6 and x7 (the remaining ten input values are ignored for the purposes of. this illustration). Each data point is labelled according to which of the three geomet-. rical classes it belongs to, and our goal is to use this data as a training set in order to. be able to classify a new observation (x6, x7), such as the one denoted by the cross. in Figure 1.19. We observe that the cross is surrounded by numerous red points, and. so we might suppose that it belongs to the red class. However, there are also plenty. of green points nearby, so we might think that it could instead belong to the green. class. It seems unlikely that it belongs to the blue class. The intuition here is that the. identity of the cross should be determined more strongly by nearby points from the. training set and less strongly by more distant points. In fact, this intuition turns out. to be reasonable and will be discussed more fully in later chapters.. How can we turn this intuition into a learning algorithm? One very simple ap-. proach would be to divide the input space into regular cells, as indicated in Fig-. ure 1.20. When we are given a test point and we wish to predict its class, we first. decide which cell it belongs to, and we then find all of the training data points that. 1.4. The Curse of Dimensionality. 35. Figure 1.20 Illustration of a simple approach. to the solution of a classification. problem in which the input space. is divided into cells and any new. test point is assigned to the class. that has a majority number of rep-. resentatives in the same cell as. the test point. As we shall see. shortly,. this simplistic approach. has some severe shortcomings.. 2. 1.5. x7. 1. 0.5. 0. 0. 0.25. 0.5. x6. 0.75. 1. fall in the same cell. The identity of the test point is predicted as being the same. as the class having the largest number of training points in the same cell as the test. point (with ties being broken at random).. There are numerous problems with this naive approach, but one of the most se-. vere becomes apparent when we consider its extension to problems having larger. numbers of input variables, corresponding to input spaces of higher dimensionality.. The origin of the problem is illustrated in Figure 1.21, which shows that, if we divide. a region of a space into regular cells, then the number of such cells grows exponen-. tially with the dimensionality of the space. The problem with an exponentially large. number of cells is that we would need an exponentially large quantity of training data. in order to ensure that the cells are not empty. Clearly, we have no hope of applying. such a technique in a space of more than a few variables, and so we need to find a. more sophisticated approach.. We can gain further insight into the problems of high-dimensional spaces by. returning to the example of polynomial curve fitting and considering how we would. Section 1.1. of.

INTRODUCTION. extend this approach to deal with input spaces having several variables. If we have. D input variables, then a general polynomial with coefficients up to order 3 would. take the form. Exercise 1.16. y(x, w) = w0 +. wixi +. wijxixj +. wijkxixjxk.. (1.74). i=1. i=1. j=1. i=1. j=1. k=1. As D increases, so the number of independent coefficients (not all of the coefficients. are independent due to interchange symmetries amongst the x variables) grows pro-. portionally to D3. In practice, to capture complex dependencies in the data, we may. need to use a higher-order polynomial. For a polynomial of order M, the growth in. the number of coefficients is like DM . Although this is now a power law growth,. rather than an exponential growth, it still points to the method becoming rapidly. unwieldy and of limited practical utility.. Our geometrical intuitions, formed through a life spent in a space of three di-. mensions, can fail badly when we consider spaces of higher dimensionality. As a. simple example, consider a sphere of radius r = 1 in a space of D dimensions, and. ask what is the fraction of the volume of the sphere that lies between radius r = 1−. and r = 1. We can evaluate this fraction by noting that the volume of a sphere of. radius r in D dimensions must scale as rD, and so we write. VD(r) = KDrD. (1.75). Exercise 1.18. where the constant KD depends only on D. Thus the required fraction is given by. Exercise 1.20. VD(1) − VD(1 − 	). VD(1). = 1 − (1 − 	)D. (1.76). which is plotted as a function of 	 for various values of D in Figure 1.22. We see. that, for large D, this fraction tends to 1 even for small values of 	. Thus, in spaces. of high dimensionality, most of the volume of a sphere is concentrated in a thin shell. near the surface!. As a further example, of direct relevance to pattern recognition, consider the. behaviour of a Gaussian distribution in a high-dimensional space. If we transform. from Cartesian to polar coordinates, and then integrate out the directional variables,. we obtain an expression for the density p(r) as a function of radius r from the origin.. Thus p(r)δr is the probability mass inside a thin shell of thickness δr located at. radius r. This distribution is plotted, for various values of D, in Figure 1.23, and we. see that for large D the probability mass of the Gaussian is concentrated in a thin. shell.. The severe difficulty that can arise in spaces of many dimensions is sometimes. called the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961). In this book, we shall make ex-. tensive use of illustrative examples involving input spaces of one or two dimensions,. because this makes it particularly easy to illustrate the techniques graphically. The. reader should be warned, however, that not all intuitions developed in spaces of low. dimensionality will generalize to spaces of many dimensions.. 1.4. The Curse of Dimensionality. 37.

Although the curse of dimensionality certainly raises important issues for pat-. tern recognition applications, it does not prevent us from finding effective techniques. applicable to high-dimensional spaces. The reasons for this are twofold. First, real. data will often be confined to a region of the space having lower effective dimension-. ality, and in particular the directions over which important variations in the target. variables occur may be so confined. Second, real data will typically exhibit some. smoothness properties (at least locally) so that for the most part small changes in the. input variables will produce small changes in the target variables, and so we can ex-. ploit local interpolation-like techniques to allow us to make predictions of the target. variables for new values of the input variables. Successful pattern recognition tech-. niques exploit one or both of these properties. Consider, for example, an application. in manufacturing in which images are captured of identical planar objects on a con-. veyor belt, in which the goal is to determine their orientation. Each image is a point. Figure 1.23 Plot of the probability density with. respect. to radius r of a Gaus-. sian distribution for various values. of.

Because the objects can occur at different positions within the image and. in different orientations, there are three degrees of freedom of variability between. images, and a set of images will live on a three dimensional manifold embedded. within the high-dimensional space. Due to the complex relationships between the. object position or orientation and the pixel intensities, this manifold will be highly. nonlinear. If the goal is to learn a model that can take an input image and output the. orientation of the object irrespective of its position, then there is only one degree of. freedom of variability within the manifold that is significant.. "
11,1.5,Decision Theory,"We have seen in Section 1.2 how probability theory provides us with a consistent. mathematical framework for quantifying and manipulating uncertainty. Here we. turn to a discussion of decision theory that, when combined with probability theory,. allows us to make optimal decisions in situations involving uncertainty such as those. encountered in pattern recognition.. Suppose we have an input vector x together with a corresponding vector t of. target variables, and our goal is to predict t given a new value for x. For regression. problems, t will comprise continuous variables, whereas for classification problems. t will represent class labels. The joint probability distribution p(x, t) provides a. complete summary of the uncertainty associated with these variables. Determination. of p(x, t) from a set of training data is an example of inference and is typically a. very difficult problem whose solution forms the subject of much of this book. In. a practical application, however, we must often make a specific prediction for the. value of t, or more generally take a specific action based on our understanding of the. values t is likely to take, and this aspect is the subject of decision theory.. Consider, for example, a medical diagnosis problem in which we have taken an. X-ray image of a patient, and we wish to determine whether the patient has cancer. or not. In this case, the input vector x is the set of pixel intensities in the image,. and output variable t will represent the presence of cancer, which we denote by the. class C1, or the absence of cancer, which we denote by the class C2. We might, for. instance, choose t to be a binary variable such that t = 0 corresponds to class C1 and. t = 1 corresponds to class C2. We shall see later that this choice of label values is. particularly convenient for probabilistic models. The general inference problem then. involves determining the joint distribution p(x,Ck), or equivalently p(x, t), which. gives us the most complete probabilistic description of the situation. Although this. can be a very useful and informative quantity, in the end we must decide either to. give treatment to the patient or not, and we would like this choice to be optimal. in some appropriate sense (Duda and Hart, 1973). This is the decision step, and. it is the subject of decision theory to tell us how to make optimal decisions given. the appropriate probabilities. We shall see that the decision stage is generally very. simple, even trivial, once we have solved the inference problem.. Here we give an introduction to the key ideas of decision theory as required for. 1.5. Decision Theory. 39. the rest of the book. Further background, as well as more detailed accounts, can be. found in Berger (1985) and Bather (2000).. Before giving a more detailed analysis, let us first consider informally how we. might expect probabilities to play a role in making decisions. When we obtain the. X-ray image x for a new patient, our goal is to decide which of the two classes to. assign to the image. We are interested in the probabilities of the two classes given. the image, which are given by p(Ck|x). Using Bayes’ theorem, these probabilities. can be expressed in the form. p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck). p(x). (1.77). Note that any of the quantities appearing in Bayes’ theorem can be obtained from. the joint distribution p(x,Ck) by either marginalizing or conditioning with respect to. the appropriate variables. We can now interpret p(Ck) as the prior probability for the. class Ck, and p(Ck|x) as the corresponding posterior probability. Thus p(C1) repre-. sents the probability that a person has cancer, before we take the X-ray measurement.. Similarly, p(C1|x) is the corresponding probability, revised using Bayes’ theorem in. light of the information contained in the X-ray. If our aim is to minimize the chance. of assigning x to the wrong class, then intuitively we would choose the class having. the higher posterior probability. We now show that this intuition is correct, and we. also discuss more general criteria for making decisions.. "
12,1.5.1,Minimizing the misclassification rate,"Suppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassifications as possible.. We need a rule that assigns each value of x to one of the available classes. Such a. rule will divide the input space into regions Rk called decision regions, one for each. class, such that all points in Rk are assigned to class Ck. The boundaries between. decision regions are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. Note that each. decision region need not be contiguous but could comprise some number of disjoint. regions. We shall encounter examples of decision boundaries and decision regions in. later chapters. In order to find the optimal decision rule, consider first of all the case. of two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance. A mistake occurs when an input. vector belonging to class C1 is assigned to class C2 or vice versa. The probability of. this occurring is given by. p(mistake) = p(x ∈ R1,C2) + p(x ∈ R2,C1). p(x,C2) dx +. R1. p(x,C1) dx.. R2. (1.78). We are free to choose the decision rule that assigns each point x to one of the two. classes. Clearly to minimize p(mistake) we should arrange that each x is assigned to. whichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in (1.78). Thus, if p(x,C1) >. p(x,C2) for a given value of x, then we should assign that x to class C1. From the. product rule of probability we have p(x,Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x). Because the factor. p(x) is common to both terms, we can restate this result as saying that the minimum. x. b. x0. k=1. K. K. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. 40. 1. INTRODUCTION. p(x,C1). R1. p(x,C2). R2. x. x. Values of x �. Figure 1.24 Schematic illustration of the joint probabilities p(x,Ck) for each of two classes plotted. against x, together with the decision boundary x =. x are classified as. class C2 and hence belong to decision region R2, whereas points x <. x are classified. as C1 and belong to R1. Errors arise from the blue, green, and red regions, so that for. x the errors are due to points from class C2 being misclassified as C1 (represented by. x <. the sum of the red and green regions), and conversely for points in the region x �. x the. errors are due to points from class C1 being misclassified as C2 (represented by the blue. region). As we vary the location. x of the decision boundary, the combined areas of the. blue and green regions remains constant, whereas the size of the red region varies. The. optimal choice for. x is where the curves for p(x,C1) and p(x, C2) cross, corresponding to. x = x0, because in this case the red region disappears. This is equivalent to the minimum. misclassification rate decision rule, which assigns each value of x to the class having the. higher posterior probability p(Ck|x).. probability of making a mistake is obtained if each value of x is assigned to the class. for which the posterior probability p(Ck|x) is largest. This result is illustrated for. two classes, and a single input variable x, in Figure 1.24.. For the more general case of K classes, it is slightly easier to maximize the. probability of being correct, which is given by. p(correct) =. p(x ∈ Rk,Ck). k=1. Rk. p(x,Ck) dx. (1.79). which is maximized when the regions Rk are chosen such that each x is assigned. to the class for which p(x,Ck) is largest. Again, using the product rule p(x,Ck) =. p(Ck|x)p(x), and noting that the factor of p(x) is common to all terms, we see. that each x should be assigned to the class having the largest posterior probability. p(Ck|x)..  cancer.

13,1.5.2,Minimizing the expected loss,"For many applications, our objective will be more complex than simply mini-. mizing the number of misclassifications. Let us consider again the medical diagnosis. problem. We note that, if a patient who does not have cancer is incorrectly diagnosed. as having cancer, the consequences may be some patient distress plus the need for. further investigations. Conversely, if a patient with cancer is diagnosed as healthy,. the result may be premature death due to lack of treatment. Thus the consequences. of these two types of mistake can be dramatically different. It would clearly be better. to make fewer mistakes of the second kind, even if this was at the expense of making. more mistakes of the first kind.. We can formalize such issues through the introduction of a loss function, also. called a cost function, which is a single, overall measure of loss incurred in taking. any of the available decisions or actions. Our goal is then to minimize the total loss. incurred. Note that some authors consider instead a utility function, whose value. they aim to maximize. These are equivalent concepts if we take the utility to be. simply the negative of the loss, and throughout this text we shall use the loss function. convention. Suppose that, for a new value of x, the true class is Ck and that we assign. x to class Cj (where j may or may not be equal to k). In so doing, we incur some. level of loss that we denote by Lkj, which we can view as the k, j element of a loss. matrix. For instance, in our cancer example, we might have a loss matrix of the form. shown in Figure 1.25. This particular loss matrix says that there is no loss incurred. if the correct decision is made, there is a loss of 1 if a healthy patient is diagnosed as. having cancer, whereas there is a loss of 1000 if a patient having cancer is diagnosed. as healthy.. The optimal solution is the one which minimizes the loss function. However,. the loss function depends on the true class, which is unknown. For a given input. vector x, our uncertainty in the true class is expressed through the joint probability. distribution p(x,Ck) and so we seek instead to minimize the average loss, where the. average is computed with respect to this distribution, which is given by. E[L] =. k. j. Rj. Lkjp(x,Ck) dx.. (1.80). Each x can be assigned independently to one of the decision regions Rj. Our goal. is to choose the regions Rj in order to minimize the expected loss (1.80), which. k Lkjp(x,Ck). As before, we can use. implies that for each x we should minimize. the product rule p(x,Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x) to eliminate the common factor of p(x).. Thus the decision rule that minimizes the expected loss is the one that assigns each. new x to the class j for which the quantity. Inputs. x such that the larger of the two poste-. rior probabilities is less than or equal to. some threshold θ will be rejected.. 1.0. 42. 1. INTRODUCTION.

This is clearly trivial to do, once we know the posterior class proba-. bilities p(Ck|x).. "
14,1.5.3,The reject option,"We have seen that classification errors arise from the regions of input space. where the largest of the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is significantly less than unity,. or equivalently where the joint distributions p(x,Ck) have comparable values. These. are the regions where we are relatively uncertain about class membership. In some. applications, it will be appropriate to avoid making decisions on the difficult cases. in anticipation of a lower error rate on those examples for which a classification de-. cision is made. This is known as the reject option. For example, in our hypothetical. medical illustration, it may be appropriate to use an automatic system to classify. those X-ray images for which there is little doubt as to the correct class, while leav-. ing a human expert to classify the more ambiguous cases. We can achieve this by. introducing a threshold θ and rejecting those inputs x for which the largest of the. posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is less than or equal to θ. This is illustrated for the. case of two classes, and a single continuous input variable x, in Figure 1.26. Note. that setting θ = 1 will ensure that all examples are rejected, whereas if there are K. classes then setting θ < 1/K will ensure that no examples are rejected. Thus the. fraction of examples that get rejected is controlled by the value of θ.. We can easily extend the reject criterion to minimize the expected loss, when. a loss matrix is given, taking account of the loss incurred when a reject decision is. made.. "
15,1.5.4,Inference and decision,"We have broken the classification problem down into two separate stages, the. inference stage in which we use training data to learn a model for p(Ck|x), and the. Exercise 1.24. p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck). p(x). (1.82). to find the posterior class probabilities p(Ck|x). As usual, the denominator. in Bayes’ theorem can be found in terms of the quantities appearing in the. numerator, because. p(x) =. p(x|Ck)p(Ck).. k. (1.83). Equivalently, we can model the joint distribution p(x,Ck) directly and then. normalize to obtain the posterior probabilities. Having found the posterior. probabilities, we use decision theory to determine class membership for each. new input x. Approaches that explicitly or implicitly model the distribution of. inputs as well as outputs are known as generative models, because by sampling. from them it is possible to generate synthetic data points in the input space.. (b) First solve the inference problem of determining the posterior class probabilities. p(Ck|x), and then subsequently use decision theory to assign each new x to. one of the classes. Approaches that model the posterior probabilities directly. are called discriminative models.. (c) Find a function f(x), called a discriminant function, which maps each input x. directly onto a class label. For instance, in the case of two-class problems,. f(·) might be binary valued and such that f = 0 represents class C1 and f = 1. represents class C2. In this case, probabilities play no role.. Let us consider the relative merits of these three alternatives. Approach (a) is the. most demanding because it involves finding the joint distribution over both x and. Ck. For many applications, x will have high dimensionality, and consequently we. may need a large training set in order to be able to determine the class-conditional. densities to reasonable accuracy. Note that the class priors p(Ck) can often be esti-. mated simply from the fractions of the training set data points in each of the classes.. One advantage of approach (a), however, is that it also allows the marginal density. of data p(x) to be determined from (1.83). This can be useful for detecting new data. points that have low probability under the model and for which the predictions may. 1.5. Decision Theory. 43. subsequent decision stage in which we use these posterior probabilities to make op-. timal class assignments. An alternative possibility would be to solve both problems. together and simply learn a function that maps inputs x directly into decisions. Such. a function is called a discriminant function.. In fact, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving decision problems,. all of which have been used in practical applications. These are given, in decreasing. order of complexity, by:. (a) First solve the inference problem of determining the class-conditional densities. p(x|Ck) for each class Ck individually. Also separately infer the prior class. probabilities p(Ck). Then use Bayes’ theorem in the form. 44. 1.

Note that the left-hand mode of the. class-conditional density p(x|C1), shown in blue on the left plot, has no effect on the posterior probabilities. The. vertical green line in the right plot shows the decision boundary in x that gives the minimum misclassification. rate.. be of low accuracy, which is known as outlier detection or novelty detection (Bishop,. 1994; Tarassenko, 1995).. However, if we only wish to make classification decisions, then it can be waste-. ful of computational resources, and excessively demanding of data, to find the joint. distribution p(x,Ck) when in fact we only really need the posterior probabilities. p(Ck|x), which can be obtained directly through approach (b). Indeed, the class-. conditional densities may contain a lot of structure that has little effect on the pos-. terior probabilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.27. There has been much interest in. exploring the relative merits of generative and discriminative approaches to machine. learning, and in finding ways to combine them (Jebara, 2004; Lasserre et al., 2006).. An even simpler approach is (c) in which we use the training data to find a. discriminant function f(x) that maps each x directly onto a class label, thereby. combining the inference and decision stages into a single learning problem. In the. example of Figure 1.27, this would correspond to finding the value of x shown by. the vertical green line, because this is the decision boundary giving the minimum. probability of misclassification.. With option (c), however, we no longer have access to the posterior probabilities. p(Ck|x). There are many powerful reasons for wanting to compute the posterior. probabilities, even if we subsequently use them to make decisions. These include:. Minimizing risk. Consider a problem in which the elements of the loss matrix are. subjected to revision from time to time (such as might occur in a financial. 1.5. Decision Theory. 45. application). If we know the posterior probabilities, we can trivially revise the. minimum risk decision criterion by modifying (1.81) appropriately. If we have. only a discriminant function, then any change to the loss matrix would require. that we return to the training data and solve the classification problem afresh.. Reject option. Posterior probabilities allow us to determine a rejection criterion that. will minimize the misclassification rate, or more generally the expected loss,. for a given fraction of rejected data points.. Compensating for class priors. Consider our medical X-ray problem again, and. suppose that we have collected a large number of X-ray images from the gen-. eral population for use as training data in order to build an automated screening. system. Because cancer is rare amongst the general population, we might find. that, say, only 1 in every 1,000 examples corresponds to the presence of can-. cer. If we used such a data set to train an adaptive model, we could run into. severe difficulties due to the small proportion of the cancer class. For instance,. a classifier that assigned every point to the normal class would already achieve. 99.9% accuracy and it would be difficult to avoid this trivial solution. Also,. even a large data set will contain very few examples of X-ray images corre-. sponding to cancer, and so the learning algorithm will not be exposed to a. broad range of examples of such images and hence is not likely to generalize. well. A balanced data set in which we have selected equal numbers of exam-. ples from each of the classes would allow us to find a more accurate model.. However, we then have to compensate for the effects of our modifications to. the training data. Suppose we have used such a modified data set and found. models for the posterior probabilities. From Bayes’ theorem (1.82), we see that. the posterior probabilities are proportional to the prior probabilities, which we. can interpret as the fractions of points in each class. We can therefore simply. take the posterior probabilities obtained from our artificially balanced data set. and first divide by the class fractions in that data set and then multiply by the. class fractions in the population to which we wish to apply the model. Finally,. we need to normalize to ensure that the new posterior probabilities sum to one.. Note that this procedure cannot be applied if we have learned a discriminant. function directly instead of determining posterior probabilities.. Combining models. For complex applications, we may wish to break the problem. into a number of smaller subproblems each of which can be tackled by a sep-. arate module. For example, in our hypothetical medical diagnosis problem,. we may have information available from, say, blood tests as well as X-ray im-. ages. Rather than combine all of this heterogeneous information into one huge. input space, it may be more effective to build one system to interpret the X-. ray images and a different one to interpret the blood data. As long as each of. the two models gives posterior probabilities for the classes, we can combine. the outputs systematically using the rules of probability. One simple way to. do this is to assume that, for each class separately, the distributions of inputs. for the X-ray images, denoted by xI, and the blood data, denoted by xB, are. independent, so that. p(xI, xB|Ck) = p(xI|Ck)p(xB|Ck).. (1.84). This is an example of conditional independence property, because the indepen-. dence holds when the distribution is conditioned on the class Ck. The posterior. probability, given both the X-ray and blood data, is then given by. p(Ck|xI, xB) ∝ p(xI, xB|Ck)p(Ck). p(Ck|xI)p(Ck|xB). ∝ p(xI|Ck)p(xB|Ck)p(Ck). p(Ck). (1.85). Thus we need the class prior probabilities p(Ck), which we can easily estimate. from the fractions of data points in each class, and then we need to normalize. the resulting posterior probabilities so they sum to one. The particular condi-. tional independence assumption (1.84) is an example of the naive Bayes model.. Note that the joint marginal distribution p(xI, xB) will typically not factorize. under this model. We shall see in later chapters how to construct models for. combining data that do not require the conditional independence assumption. (1.84).. "
16,1.5.5,Loss functions for regression,"So far, we have discussed decision theory in the context of classification prob-. lems. We now turn to the case of regression problems, such as the curve fitting. example discussed earlier. The decision stage consists of choosing a specific esti-. mate y(x) of the value of t for each input x. Suppose that in doing so, we incur a. loss L(t, y(x)). The average, or expected, loss is then given by. E[L] =. L(t, y(x))p(x, t) dx dt.. (1.86). A common choice of loss function in regression problems is the squared loss given. by L(t, y(x)) = {y(x) − t}2. In this case, the expected loss can be written. E[L] =. {y(x) − t}2p(x, t) dx dt.. Our goal is to choose y(x) so as to minimize E[L].. If we assume a completely. flexible function y(x), we can do this formally using the calculus of variations to. give. δE[L]. δy(x). = 2. {y(x) − t}p(x, t) dt = 0.. Solving for y(x), and using the sum and product rules of probability, we obtain. (1.87). (1.88). tp(x, t) dt. y(x) =. p(x). tp(t|x) dt = Et[t|x]. (1.89). 46. 1. INTRODUCTION. Section 8.2. Section 8.2.2. Section 1.1. Appendix D.

Decision Theory. 47. y(x). p(t|x0). x0. x. Exercise 1.25. which is the conditional average of t conditioned on x and is known as the regression. function. This result is illustrated in Figure 1.28. It can readily be extended to mul-. tiple target variables represented by the vector t, in which case the optimal solution. is the conditional average y(x) = Et[t|x].. We can also derive this result in a slightly different way, which will also shed. light on the nature of the regression problem. Armed with the knowledge that the. optimal solution is the conditional expectation, we can expand the square term as. follows. {y(x) − t}2 = {y(x) − E[t|x] + E[t|x] − t}2. = {y(x) − E[t|x]}2 + 2{y(x) − E[t|x]}{E[t|x] − t} + {E[t|x] − t}2. where, to keep the notation uncluttered, we use E[t|x] to denote Et[t|x]. Substituting. into the loss function and performing the integral over t, we see that the cross-term. vanishes and we obtain an expression for the loss function in the form. E[L] =. {y(x) − E[t|x]}2 p(x) dx +. {E[t|x] − t}2p(x) dx.. (1.90). The function y(x) we seek to determine enters only in the first term, which will be. minimized when y(x) is equal to E[t|x], in which case this term will vanish. This. is simply the result that we derived previously and that shows that the optimal least. squares predictor is given by the conditional mean. The second term is the variance. of the distribution of t, averaged over x.. It represents the intrinsic variability of. the target data and can be regarded as noise. Because it is independent of y(x), it. represents the irreducible minimum value of the loss function.. As with the classification problem, we can either determine the appropriate prob-. abilities and then use these to make optimal decisions, or we can build models that. make decisions directly. Indeed, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving. regression problems given, in order of decreasing complexity, by:. (a) First solve the inference problem of determining the joint density p(x, t). Then. normalize to find the conditional density p(t|x), and finally marginalize to find. the conditional mean given by (1.89).. Section 5.6. Exercise 1.27. E[Lq] =. |y(x) − t|qp(x, t) dx dt. (1.91). which reduces to the expected squared loss for q = 2. The function |y − t|q is. plotted against y − t for various values of q in Figure 1.29. The minimum of E[Lq]. is given by the conditional mean for q = 2, the conditional median for q = 1, and. the conditional mode for q → 0.. 1.6.. Information Theory. In this chapter, we have discussed a variety of concepts from probability theory and. decision theory that will form the foundations for much of the subsequent discussion. in this book. We close this chapter by introducing some additional concepts from. the field of information theory, which will also prove useful in our development of. pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. Again, we shall focus only on. the key concepts, and we refer the reader elsewhere for more detailed discussions. (Viterbi and Omura, 1979; Cover and Thomas, 1991; MacKay, 2003) .. We begin by considering a discrete random variable x and we ask how much. information is received when we observe a specific value for this variable. The. amount of information can be viewed as the ‘degree of surprise’ on learning the. value of x. If we are told that a highly improbable event has just occurred, we will. have received more information than if we were told that some very likely event. has just occurred, and if we knew that the event was certain to happen we would. receive no information. Our measure of information content will therefore depend. on the probability distribution p(x), and we therefore look for a quantity h(x) that. is a monotonic function of the probability p(x) and that expresses the information. content. The form of h(·) can be found by noting that if we have two events x. and y that are unrelated, then the information gain from observing both of them. should be the sum of the information gained from each of them separately, so that. h(x, y) = h(x) + h(y). Two unrelated events will be statistically independent and. so p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). From these two relationships, it is easily shown that h(x). must be given by the logarithm of p(x) and so we have. Exercise 1.28. 48. 1. INTRODUCTION. (b) First solve the inference problem of determining the conditional density p(t|x),. and then subsequently marginalize to find the conditional mean given by (1.89).. (c) Find a regression function y(x) directly from the training data.. The relative merits of these three approaches follow the same lines as for classifica-. tion problems above.. The squared loss is not the only possible choice of loss function for regression.. Indeed, there are situations in which squared loss can lead to very poor results and. where we need to develop more sophisticated approaches. An important example. concerns situations in which the conditional distribution p(t|x) is multimodal, as. often arises in the solution of inverse problems. Here we consider briefly one simple. generalization of the squared loss, called the Minkowski loss, whose expectation is. given by. 2. q. t. 1. y. 0. −2. 2. q. t. 1. y. q = 0.3. −1. 0. y − t. 1. 2. q = 2. 0. −2. −1. 1. 2. 0. y − t.

Note that low. probability events x correspond to high information content. The choice of basis. for the logarithm is arbitrary, and for the moment we shall adopt the convention. prevalent in information theory of using logarithms to the base of 2. In this case, as. we shall see shortly, the units of h(x) are bits (‘binary digits’).. Now suppose that a sender wishes to transmit the value of a random variable to. a receiver. The average amount of information that they transmit in the process is. obtained by taking the expectation of (1.92) with respect to the distribution p(x) and. is given by. H[x] = −. x. p(x) log2 p(x).. (1.93). This important quantity is called the entropy of the random variable x. Note that. limp→0 p ln p = 0 and so we shall take p(x) ln p(x) = 0 whenever we encounter a. value for x such that p(x) = 0.. So far we have given a rather heuristic motivation for the definition of informa-. 50. 1. INTRODUCTION. tion (1.92) and the corresponding entropy (1.93). We now show that these definitions. indeed possess useful properties. Consider a random variable x having 8 possible. states, each of which is equally likely. In order to communicate the value of x to. a receiver, we would need to transmit a message of length 3 bits. Notice that the. entropy of this variable is given by. H[x] = −8 ×. 1. 8. log2. 1. 8. = 3 bits.. 1. 8. 1. 64. Now consider an example (Cover and Thomas, 1991) of a variable having 8 pos-. sible states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} for which the respective probabilities are given by. ( 1. 2 , 1. 8 , 1. 4 , 1. 16 , 1. 64 , 1. 1. 2. 64).

We see that the nonuniform distribution has a smaller entropy than the uniform one,. and we shall gain some insight into this shortly when we discuss the interpretation of. entropy in terms of disorder. For the moment, let us consider how we would transmit. the identity of the variable’s state to a receiver. We could do this, as before, using. a 3-bit number. However, we can take advantage of the nonuniform distribution by. using shorter codes for the more probable events, at the expense of longer codes for. the less probable events, in the hope of getting a shorter average code length. This. can be done by representing the states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} using, for instance, the. following set of code strings: 0, 10, 110, 1110, 111100, 111101, 111110, 111111.. The average length of the code that has to be transmitted is then. 1. 2 × 1 +. 1. 4 × 2 +. average code length =. 1. 64 × 6 = 2 bits. which again is the same as the entropy of the random variable. Note that shorter code. strings cannot be used because it must be possible to disambiguate a concatenation. of such strings into its component parts. For instance, 11001110 decodes uniquely. into the state sequence c, a, d.. 1. 16 × 4 + 4 ×. 1. 8 × 3 +. This relation between entropy and shortest coding length is a general one. The. noiseless coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) states that the entropy is a lower bound. on the number of bits needed to transmit the state of a random variable.. From now on, we shall switch to the use of natural logarithms in defining en-. tropy, as this will provide a more convenient link with ideas elsewhere in this book.. In this case, the entropy is measured in units of ‘nats’ instead of bits, which differ. simply by a factor of ln 2.. We have introduced the concept of entropy in terms of the average amount of. information needed to specify the state of a random variable. In fact, the concept of. entropy has much earlier origins in physics where it was introduced in the context. of equilibrium thermodynamics and later given a deeper interpretation as a measure. of disorder through developments in statistical mechanics. We can understand this. alternative view of entropy by considering a set of N identical objects that are to be. divided amongst a set of bins, such that there are ni objects in the ith bin. Consider. W = N!. ni. N. 1. N. 1. N. i. i. 1. N. 1.6. Information Theory. 51. the number of different ways of allocating the objects to the bins. There are N. ways to choose the first object, (N − 1) ways to choose the second object, and. so on, leading to a total of N! ways to allocate all N objects to the bins, where N!. (pronounced ‘factorial N’) denotes the product N ×(N −1)×···×2×1. However,. we don’t wish to distinguish between rearrangements of objects within each bin. In. the ith bin there are ni! ways of reordering the objects, and so the total number of. ways of allocating the N objects to the bins is given by. which is called the multiplicity. The entropy is then defined as the logarithm of the. multiplicity scaled by an appropriate constant. i ni!. (1.94). H =. ln W =. ln N! −. ln ni!.. (1.95). We now consider the limit N → ∞, in which the fractions ni/N are held fixed, and. apply Stirling’s approximation. ln N!  N ln N − N. (1.96). which gives. ni. N. i. ln. H = − lim. N→∞. i ni = N. Here pi = limN→∞(ni/N) is the probability. where we have used. of an object being assigned to the ith bin. In physics terminology, the specific ar-. rangements of objects in the bins is called a microstate, and the overall distribution. of occupation numbers, expressed through the ratios ni/N, is called a macrostate.. The multiplicity W is also known as the weight of the macrostate.. pi ln pi. (1.97). We can interpret the bins as the states xi of a discrete random variable X, where. p(X = xi) = pi. The entropy of the random variable X is then. H[p] = −. i. p(xi) ln p(xi).. (1.98). Distributions p(xi) that are sharply peaked around a few values will have a relatively. low entropy, whereas those that are spread more evenly across many values will. have higher entropy, as illustrated in Figure 1.30. Because 0 � pi � 1, the entropy. is nonnegative, and it will equal its minimum value of 0 when one of the pi =. 1 and all other pj=i = 0. The maximum entropy configuration can be found by. maximizing H using a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the normalization constraint. on the probabilities. Thus we maximize. H = −. i. p(xi) ln p(xi) + λ. p(xi) − 1. i. (1.99). Appendix E. H = 1.77. H = 3.09. 52. 1.

The largest entropy would arise from a uniform distribution that would give H =. − ln(1/30) = 3.40.. Exercise 1.29. from which we find that all of the p(xi) are equal and are given by p(xi) = 1/M. where M is the total number of states xi. The corresponding value of the entropy. is then H = ln M. This result can also be derived from Jensen’s inequality (to be. discussed shortly). To verify that the stationary point is indeed a maximum, we can. evaluate the second derivative of the entropy, which gives. H. ∂p(xi)∂p(xj). = −Iij. 1. pi. (1.100). where Iij are the elements of the identity matrix.. We can extend the definition of entropy to include distributions p(x) over con-. tinuous variables x as follows. First divide x into bins of width ∆. Then, assuming. p(x) is continuous, the mean value theorem (Weisstein, 1999) tells us that, for each. such bin, there must exist a value xi such that. (i+1)∆. i∆. p(x) dx = p(xi)∆.. (1.101). We can now quantize the continuous variable x by assigning any value x to the value. xi whenever x falls in the ith bin. The probability of observing the value xi is then. p(xi)∆. This gives a discrete distribution for which the entropy takes the form. H∆ = −. i. p(xi)∆ ln (p(xi)∆) = −. p(xi)∆ ln p(xi) − ln ∆. (1.102). i. i p(xi)∆ = 1, which follows from (1.101). We now omit. where we have used. the second term − ln ∆ on the right-hand side of (1.102) and then consider the limit. 1.6. Information Theory. 53. ∆ → 0. The first term on the right-hand side of (1.102) will approach the integral of. p(x) ln p(x) in this limit so that. lim. ∆→0. i. p(xi)∆ ln p(xi). p(x) ln p(x) dx. (1.103). where the quantity on the right-hand side is called the differential entropy. We see. that the discrete and continuous forms of the entropy differ by a quantity ln ∆, which. diverges in the limit ∆ → 0. This reflects the fact that to specify a continuous. variable very precisely requires a large number of bits. For a density defined over. multiple continuous variables, denoted collectively by the vector x, the differential. entropy is given by. H[x] = −. p(x) ln p(x) dx.. (1.104). In the case of discrete distributions, we saw that the maximum entropy con-. figuration corresponded to an equal distribution of probabilities across the possible. states of the variable. Let us now consider the maximum entropy configuration for. a continuous variable. In order for this maximum to be well defined, it will be nec-. essary to constrain the first and second moments of p(x) as well as preserving the. normalization constraint. We therefore maximize the differential entropy with the. Ludwig Boltzmann. 1844–1906. Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann was an. Austrian physicist who created the. field of statistical mechanics. Prior. to Boltzmann,. the concept of en-. tropy was already known from. classical thermodynamics where it. quantifies the fact that when we take energy from a. system, not all of that energy is typically available. to do useful work. Boltzmann showed that the ther-. modynamic entropy S, a macroscopic quantity, could. be related to the statistical properties at the micro-. scopic level. This is expressed through the famous. equation S = k ln W in which W represents the. number of possible microstates in a macrostate, and. k  1.38 × 10−23 (in units of Joules per Kelvin) is. known as Boltzmann’s constant. Boltzmann’s ideas. were disputed by many scientists of they day. One dif-. ficulty they saw arose from the second law of thermo-. dynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed. system tends to increase with time. By contrast, at. the microscopic level the classical Newtonian equa-. tions of physics are reversible, and so they found it. difficult to see how the latter could explain the for-. mer. They didn’t fully appreciate Boltzmann’s argu-. ments, which were statistical in nature and which con-. cluded not that entropy could never decrease over. time but simply that with overwhelming probability it. would generally increase. Boltzmann even had a long-. running dispute with the editor of the leading German. physics journal who refused to let him refer to atoms. and molecules as anything other than convenient the-. oretical constructs. The continued attacks on his work. lead to bouts of depression, and eventually he com-. mitted suicide. Shortly after Boltzmann’s death, new. experiments by Perrin on colloidal suspensions veri-. fied his theories and confirmed the value of the Boltz-. mann constant. The equation S = k ln W is carved on. Boltzmann’s tombstone.. 1. 1. 2. 54. 1. INTRODUCTION. three constraints. Appendix E. Appendix D. Exercise 1.34. Exercise 1.35. p(x) dx = 1. xp(x) dx = µ. (x − µ)2p(x) dx = σ2.. (1.105). (1.106). (1.107).

The Lagrange multipliers can be found by back substitution of this result into the. three constraint equations, leading finally to the result. p(x) =. (2πσ2)1/2. exp. (x − µ)2. 2σ2. (1.109). and so the distribution that maximizes the differential entropy is the Gaussian. Note. that we did not constrain the distribution to be nonnegative when we maximized the. entropy. However, because the resulting distribution is indeed nonnegative, we see. with hindsight that such a constraint is not necessary.. If we evaluate the differential entropy of the Gaussian, we obtain. H[x] =. 1 + ln(2πσ2). (1.110). Thus we see again that the entropy increases as the distribution becomes broader,. i.e., as σ2 increases. This result also shows that the differential entropy, unlike the. discrete entropy, can be negative, because H(x) < 0 in (1.110) for σ2 < 1/(2πe).. Suppose we have a joint distribution p(x, y) from which we draw pairs of values. of x and y. If a value of x is already known, then the additional information needed. to specify the corresponding value of y is given by − ln p(y|x). Thus the average. additional information needed to specify y can be written as. H[y|x] = −. p(y, x) ln p(y|x) dy dx. (1.111). Exercise 1.37. which is called the conditional entropy of y given x. It is easily seen, using the. product rule, that the conditional entropy satisfies the relation. 1.6. Information Theory. 55. H[x, y] = H[y|x] + H[x]. (1.112). where H[x, y] is the differential entropy of p(x, y) and H[x] is the differential en-. tropy of the marginal distribution p(x). Thus the information needed to describe x. and y is given by the sum of the information needed to describe x alone plus the. additional information required to specify y given x.. "
18,1.6.1,Relative entropy and mutual information,"So far in this section, we have introduced a number of concepts from information. theory, including the key notion of entropy. We now start to relate these ideas to. pattern recognition. Consider some unknown distribution p(x), and suppose that. we have modelled this using an approximating distribution q(x). If we use q(x) to. construct a coding scheme for the purpose of transmitting values of x to a receiver,. then the average additional amount of information (in nats) required to specify the. value of x (assuming we choose an efficient coding scheme) as a result of using q(x). instead of the true distribution p(x) is given by. KL(pq) = −. p(x) ln q(x) dx −. p(x) ln. q(x). p(x). dx.. p(x) ln p(x) dx. (1.113). This is known as the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, or KL diver-. gence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), between the distributions p(x) and q(x). Note. that it is not a symmetrical quantity, that is to say KL(pq) ≡ KL(qp).. We now show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfies KL(pq) � 0 with. equality if, and only if, p(x) = q(x). To do this we first introduce the concept of. convex functions. A function f(x) is said to be convex if it has the property that. every chord lies on or above the function, as shown in Figure 1.31. Any value of x. in the interval from x = a to x = b can be written in the form λa + (1 − λ)b where. 0 � λ � 1. The corresponding point on the chord is given by λf(a) + (1 − λ)f(b),. Claude Shannon. 1916–2001. After graduating from Michigan and. MIT, Shannon joined the AT&T Bell. Telephone laboratories in 1941. His. paper ‘A Mathematical Theory of. Communication’ published in the. Bell System Technical Journal in. 1948 laid the foundations for modern information the-. ory. This paper introduced the word ‘bit’, and his con-. cept that information could be sent as a stream of 1s. and 0s paved the way for the communications revo-. lution.. It is said that von Neumann recommended to. Shannon that he use the term entropy, not only be-. cause of its similarity to the quantity used in physics,. but also because “nobody knows what entropy really. is, so in any discussion you will always have an advan-. tage”.. i=1.

Convexity then. implies. (1.114). f(λa + (1 − λ)b) � λf(a) + (1 − λ)f(b).. This is equivalent to the requirement that the second derivative of the function be. everywhere positive. Examples of convex functions are x ln x (for x > 0) and x2. A. function is called strictly convex if the equality is satisfied only for λ = 0 and λ = 1.. If a function has the opposite property, namely that every chord lies on or below the. function, it is called concave, with a corresponding definition for strictly concave. If. a function f(x) is convex, then −f(x) will be concave.. convex function f(x) satisfies. Using the technique of proof by induction, we can show from (1.114) that a. Exercise 1.36. Exercise 1.38. λixi. λif(xi). (1.115). where λi � 0 and. i λi = 1, for any set of points {xi}. The result (1.115) is. known as Jensen’s inequality.

(1.116). where E[·] denotes the expectation. For continuous variables, Jensen’s inequality. takes the form. (1.117). f(x)p(x) dx.. xp(x) dx. f.

Information Theory. 57. where we have used the fact that − ln x is a convex function, together with the nor-. q(x) dx = 1. In fact, − ln x is a strictly convex function,. malization condition. so the equality will hold if, and only if, q(x) = p(x) for all x. Thus we can in-. terpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of the dissimilarity of the two. distributions p(x) and q(x).. We see that there is an intimate relationship between data compression and den-. sity estimation (i.e., the problem of modelling an unknown probability distribution). because the most efficient compression is achieved when we know the true distri-. bution. If we use a distribution that is different from the true one, then we must. necessarily have a less efficient coding, and on average the additional information. that must be transmitted is (at least) equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence be-. tween the two distributions.. Suppose that data is being generated from an unknown distribution p(x) that we. wish to model. We can try to approximate this distribution using some parametric. distribution q(x|θ), governed by a set of adjustable parameters θ, for example a. multivariate Gaussian. One way to determine θ is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler. divergence between p(x) and q(x|θ) with respect to θ. We cannot do this directly. because we don’t know p(x). Suppose, however, that we have observed a finite set. of training points xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, drawn from p(x). Then the expectation. with respect to p(x) can be approximated by a finite sum over these points, using. (1.35), so that. KL(pq) . {− ln q(xn|θ) + ln p(xn)} .. (1.119). The second term on the right-hand side of (1.119) is independent of θ, and the first. term is the negative log likelihood function for θ under the distribution q(x|θ) eval-. uated using the training set. Thus we see that minimizing this Kullback-Leibler. divergence is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function.. Now consider the joint distribution between two sets of variables x and y given. by p(x, y). If the sets of variables are independent, then their joint distribution will. factorize into the product of their marginals p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). If the variables are. not independent, we can gain some idea of whether they are ‘close’ to being indepen-. dent by considering the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution. and the product of the marginals, given by. I[x, y] ≡ KL(p(x, y)p(x)p(y)). p(x, y) ln. p(x)p(y). p(x, y). dx dy. (1.120). Exercise 1.41. which is called the mutual information between the variables x and y. From the. properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we see that I(x, y) � 0 with equal-. ity if, and only if, x and y are independent. Using the sum and product rules of. probability, we see that the mutual information is related to the conditional entropy. through. I[x, y] = H[x] − H[x|y] = H[y] − H[y|x].. (1.121). M. N. N. 58. 1. INTRODUCTION. Thus we can view the mutual information as the reduction in the uncertainty about x. by virtue of being told the value of y (or vice versa). From a Bayesian perspective,. we can view p(x) as the prior distribution for x and p(x|y) as the posterior distribu-. tion after we have observed new data y. The mutual information therefore represents. the reduction in uncertainty about x as a consequence of the new observation y..

If a box is chosen. at random with probabilities p(r) = 0.2, p(b) = 0.2, p(g) = 0.6, and a piece of. fruit is removed from the box (with equal probability of selecting any of the items in. the box), then what is the probability of selecting an apple?

This shows that the maximum. of a probability density (in contrast to a simple function) is dependent on the choice. of variable.

Finally, use the two previous results, together. with proof by induction, to show. n(D, M) =. (D + M − 1)!. (D − 1)! M! .. To do this, first show that the result is true for M = 2, and any value of D � 1,. by comparison with the result of Exercise 1.14.

19,2,Probability Distributions,"In Chapter 1, we emphasized the central role played by probability theory in the. solution of pattern recognition problems. We turn now to an exploration of some. particular examples of probability distributions and their properties. As well as be-. ing of great interest in their own right, these distributions can form building blocks. for more complex models and will be used extensively throughout the book. The. distributions introduced in this chapter will also serve another important purpose,. namely to provide us with the opportunity to discuss some key statistical concepts,. such as Bayesian inference, in the context of simple models before we encounter. them in more complex situations in later chapters.. One role for the distributions discussed in this chapter is to model the prob-. ability distribution p(x) of a random variable x, given a finite set x1, . . . , xN of. observations. This problem is known as density estimation. For the purposes of. this chapter, we shall assume that the data points are independent and identically. distributed. It should be emphasized that the problem of density estimation is fun-. 67. 68. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. damentally ill-posed, because there are infinitely many probability distributions that. could have given rise to the observed finite data set. Indeed, any distribution p(x). that is nonzero at each of the data points x1, . . . , xN is a potential candidate. The. issue of choosing an appropriate distribution relates to the problem of model selec-. tion that has already been encountered in the context of polynomial curve fitting in. Chapter 1 and that is a central issue in pattern recognition.. We begin by considering the binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete. random variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables.. These are specific examples of parametric distributions, so-called because they are. governed by a small number of adaptive parameters, such as the mean and variance in. the case of a Gaussian for example. To apply such models to the problem of density. estimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters,. given an observed data set. In a frequentist treatment, we choose specific values. for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By. contrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters. and then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution. given the observed data.. We shall see that an important role is played by conjugate priors, that lead to. posterior distributions having the same functional form as the prior, and that there-. fore lead to a greatly simplified Bayesian analysis. For example, the conjugate prior. for the parameters of the multinomial distribution is called the Dirichlet distribution,. while the conjugate prior for the mean of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. All of these. distributions are examples of the exponential family of distributions, which possess. a number of important properties, and which will be discussed in some detail.. One limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a specific functional. form for the distribution, which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular. application. An alternative approach is given by nonparametric density estimation. methods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data. set. Such models still contain parameters, but these control the model complexity. rather than the form of the distribution. We end this chapter by considering three. nonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and. kernels.. "
20,2.1,Binary Variables,"We begin by considering a single binary random variable x ∈ {0, 1}. For example,. x might describe the outcome of flipping a coin, with x = 1 representing ‘heads’,. and x = 0 representing ‘tails’. We can imagine that this is a damaged coin so that. the probability of landing heads is not necessarily the same as that of landing tails.. The probability of x = 1 will be denoted by the parameter µ so that. p(x = 1|µ) = µ. (2.1). N. N. N. N. n=1. N. 2.1. Binary Variables. 69. where 0 � µ � 1, from which it follows that p(x = 0|µ) = 1 − µ. The probability. distribution over x can therefore be written in the form. Bern(x|µ) = µx(1 − µ)1−x. (2.2). which is known as the Bernoulli distribution. It is easily verified that this distribution. is normalized and that it has mean and variance given by. E[x] = µ. var[x] = µ(1 − µ).. (2.3). (2.4). Now suppose we have a data set D = {x1, . . . , xN} of observed values of x.. We can construct the likelihood function, which is a function of µ, on the assumption. that the observations are drawn independently from p(x|µ), so that. p(D|µ) =. p(xn|µ) =. n=1. n=1. µxn(1 − µ)1−xn.. (2.5). In a frequentist setting, we can estimate a value for µ by maximizing the likelihood. function, or equivalently by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood. In the case. of the Bernoulli distribution, the log likelihood function is given by. ln p(D|µ) =. ln p(xn|µ) =. n=1. {xn ln µ + (1 − xn) ln(1 − µ)} .. (2.6). At this point, it is worth noting that the log likelihood function depends on the N. observations xn only through their sum. n xn. This sum provides an example of a. sufficient statistic for the data under this distribution, and we shall study the impor-. tant role of sufficient statistics in some detail. If we set the derivative of ln p(D|µ). with respect to µ equal to zero, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimator. µML =. 1. N. xn. n=1. (2.7). Exercise 2.1. Section 2.4. Jacob Bernoulli. 1654–1705. Jacob Bernoulli, also known as. Jacques or James Bernoulli, was a. Swiss mathematician and was the. first of many in the Bernoulli family. to pursue a career in science and. mathematics. Although compelled. to study philosophy and theology against his will by. his parents, he travelled extensively after graduating. in order to meet with many of the leading scientists of. his time, including Boyle and Hooke in England. When. he returned to Switzerland, he taught mechanics and. became Professor of Mathematics at Basel in 1687.. Unfortunately, rivalry between Jacob and his younger. brother Johann turned an initially productive collabora-. tion into a bitter and public dispute. Jacob’s most sig-. nificant contributions to mathematics appeared in The. ArtofConjecture published in 1713, eight years after. his death, which deals with topics in probability the-. ory including what has become known as the Bernoulli. distribution.. 1. 0. 0.2. 0.1. 0. 2. 3. 4. 5. m. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. which is also known as the sample mean. If we denote the number of observations. of x = 1 (heads) within this data set by m, then we can write (2.7) in the form. µML = m. N. (2.8). so that the probability of landing heads is given, in this maximum likelihood frame-. work, by the fraction of observations of heads in the data set.. Now suppose we flip a coin, say, 3 times and happen to observe 3 heads. Then. N = m = 3 and µML = 1. In this case, the maximum likelihood result would. predict that all future observations should give heads. Common sense tells us that. this is unreasonable, and in fact this is an extreme example of the over-fitting associ-. ated with maximum likelihood. We shall see shortly how to arrive at more sensible. conclusions through the introduction of a prior distribution over µ.. We can also work out the distribution of the number m of observations of x = 1,. given that the data set has size N. This is called the binomial distribution, and. from (2.5) we see that it is proportional to µm(1 − µ)N−m. In order to obtain the. normalization coefficient we note that out of N coin flips, we have to add up all. of the possible ways of obtaining m heads, so that the binomial distribution can be. written. Bin(m|N, µ) =. N. m. µm(1 − µ)N−m. N!. N. m. (N − m)!m!. (2.9). (2.10). is the number of ways of choosing m objects out of a total of N identical objects.. Figure 2.1 shows a plot of the binomial distribution for N = 10 and µ = 0.25.. The mean and variance of the binomial distribution can be found by using the. result of Exercise 1.10, which shows that for independent events the mean of the. sum is the sum of the means, and the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.. Because m = x1 + . . . + xN , and for each observation the mean and variance are. 70. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS.

21,2.1.1,The beta distribution,"We have seen in (2.8) that the maximum likelihood setting for the parameter µ. in the Bernoulli distribution, and hence in the binomial distribution, is given by the. fraction of the observations in the data set having x = 1. As we have already noted,. this can give severely over-fitted results for small data sets. In order to develop a. Bayesian treatment for this problem, we need to introduce a prior distribution p(µ). over the parameter µ. Here we consider a form of prior distribution that has a simple. interpretation as well as some useful analytical properties. To motivate this prior,. we note that the likelihood function takes the form of the product of factors of the. form µx(1 − µ)1−x. If we choose a prior to be proportional to powers of µ and. (1 − µ), then the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of the. prior and the likelihood function, will have the same functional form as the prior.. This property is called conjugacy and we will see several examples of it later in this. chapter. We therefore choose a prior, called the beta distribution, given by. Beta(µ|a, b) =. Γ(a + b). Γ(a)Γ(b) µa−1(1 − µ)b−1. (2.13). where Γ(x) is the gamma function defined by (1.141), and the coefficient in (2.13). ensures that the beta distribution is normalized, so that. Exercise 2.4. Exercise 2.5. Exercise 2.6. The mean and variance of the beta distribution are given by. 1. 0. Beta(µ|a, b) dµ = 1.. E[µ] =. var[µ] =. a. a + b. (a + b)2(a + b + 1) .. ab. (2.14). (2.15). (2.16). The parameters a and b are often called hyperparameters because they control the. distribution of the parameter µ. Figure 2.2 shows plots of the beta distribution for. various values of the hyperparameters.. The posterior distribution of µ is now obtained by multiplying the beta prior. (2.13) by the binomial likelihood function (2.9) and normalizing. Keeping only the. factors that depend on µ, we see that this posterior distribution has the form. p(µ|m, l, a, b) ∝ µm+a−1(1 − µ)l+b−1. (2.17). 72. 2.

We see that (2.17) has the same functional dependence on µ as the prior. distribution, reflecting the conjugacy properties of the prior with respect to the like-. lihood function. Indeed, it is simply another beta distribution, and its normalization. coefficient can therefore be obtained by comparison with (2.13) to give. p(µ|m, l, a, b) =. Γ(m + a + l + b). Γ(m + a)Γ(l + b) µm+a−1(1 − µ)l+b−1.. (2.18). We see that the effect of observing a data set of m observations of x = 1 and. l observations of x = 0 has been to increase the value of a by m, and the value of. b by l, in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. This allows. us to provide a simple interpretation of the hyperparameters a and b in the prior as. an effective number of observations of x = 1 and x = 0, respectively. Note that. a and b need not be integers. Furthermore, the posterior distribution can act as the. prior if we subsequently observe additional data. To see this, we can imagine taking. observations one at a time and after each observation updating the current posterior. likelihood function. prior. 2. 1. 0. 0. 2. 1. 0. 0.5. 1. 0. 0.5. 1. 2.1.

The prior is given by a beta distribution. with parameters a = 2, b = 2, and the likelihood function, given by (2.9) with N = m = 1, corresponds to a. single observation of x = 1, so that the posterior is given by a beta distribution with parameters a = 3, b = 2.. Section 2.3.5. distribution by multiplying by the likelihood function for the new observation and. then normalizing to obtain the new, revised posterior distribution. At each stage, the. posterior is a beta distribution with some total number of (prior and actual) observed. values for x = 1 and x = 0 given by the parameters a and b. Incorporation of an. additional observation of x = 1 simply corresponds to incrementing the value of a. by 1, whereas for an observation of x = 0 we increment b by 1. Figure 2.3 illustrates. one step in this process.. We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt. a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood. function and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d. data. Sequential methods make. use of observations one at a time, or in small batches, and then discard them before. the next observations are used. They can be used, for example, in real-time learning. scenarios where a steady stream of data is arriving, and predictions must be made. before all of the data is seen. Because they do not require the whole data set to be. stored or loaded into memory, sequential methods are also useful for large data sets.. Maximum likelihood methods can also be cast into a sequential framework.. If our goal is to predict, as best we can, the outcome of the next trial, then we. must evaluate the predictive distribution of x, given the observed data set D. From. the sum and product rules of probability, this takes the form. p(x = 1|D) =. 1. 0. p(x = 1|µ)p(µ|D) dµ =. 1. 0. µp(µ|D) dµ = E[µ|D].. (2.19). Using the result (2.18) for the posterior distribution p(µ|D), together with the result. (2.15) for the mean of the beta distribution, we obtain. m + a. (2.20). p(x = 1|D) =. m + a + l + b. which has a simple interpretation as the total fraction of observations (both real ob-. servations and fictitious prior observations) that correspond to x = 1. Note that in. the limit of an infinitely large data set m, l → ∞ the result (2.20) reduces to the. maximum likelihood result (2.8). As we shall see, it is a very general property that. the Bayesian and maximum likelihood results will agree in the limit of an infinitely. 74. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. Exercise 2.7. Exercise 2.8. large data set. For a finite data set, the posterior mean for µ always lies between the. prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for µ corresponding to the relative. frequencies of events given by (2.7).. From Figure 2.2, we see that as the number of observations increases, so the. posterior distribution becomes more sharply peaked. This can also be seen from. the result (2.16) for the variance of the beta distribution, in which we see that the. variance goes to zero for a → ∞ or b → ∞. In fact, we might wonder whether it is. a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the. uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease.. To address this, we can take a frequentist view of Bayesian learning and show. that, on average, such a property does indeed hold. Consider a general Bayesian. inference problem for a parameter θ for which we have observed a data set D, de-. scribed by the joint distribution p(θ,D). The following result. Eθ[θ] = ED [Eθ[θ|D]]. p(θ)θ dθ. where. Eθ[θ] ≡. ED[Eθ[θ|D]] ≡. θp(θ|D) dθ. p(D) dD. (2.21). (2.22). (2.23). says that the posterior mean of θ, averaged over the distribution generating the data,. is equal to the prior mean of θ. Similarly, we can show that. varθ[θ] = ED [varθ[θ|D]] + varD [Eθ[θ|D]] .. (2.24). The term on the left-hand side of (2.24) is the prior variance of θ. On the right-. hand side, the first term is the average posterior variance of θ, and the second term. measures the variance in the posterior mean of θ. Because this variance is a positive. quantity, this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of θ is smaller than. the prior variance. The reduction in variance is greater if the variance in the posterior. mean is greater. Note, however, that this result only holds on average, and that for a. particular observed data set it is possible for the posterior variance to be larger than. the prior variance.. "
22,2.2,Multinomial Variables,"Binary variables can be used to describe quantities that can take one of two possible. values. Often, however, we encounter discrete variables that can take on one of K. possible mutually exclusive states. Although there are various alternative ways to. express such variables, we shall see shortly that a particularly convenient represen-. tation is the 1-of-K scheme in which the variable is represented by a K-dimensional. vector x in which one of the elements xk equals 1, and all remaining elements equal. n=1.

So, for instance if we have a variable that can take K = 6 states and a particular. observation of the variable happens to correspond to the state where x3 = 1, then x. will be represented by. Note that such vectors satisfy. by the parameter µk, then the distribution of x is given. x = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T.. (2.25). k=1 xk = 1. If we denote the probability of xk = 1. K. (2.26). (2.27).

It is easily seen that the distribution is normalized. p(x|µ) =. µxk. k. p(x|µ) =. µk = 1. and that. E[x|µ] =. p(x|µ)x = (µ1, . . . , µM )T = µ..

23,2.2.1,The Dirichlet distribution,"We now introduce a family of prior distributions for the parameters {µk} of. the multinomial distribution (2.34). By inspection of the form of the multinomial. distribution, we see that the conjugate prior is given by. mk = N.. p(µ|α) ∝. µαk−1. k. (2.35). (2.36). (2.37).

We see that the posterior distribution again takes the form of a Dirichlet distribution,. confirming that the Dirichlet is indeed a conjugate prior for the multinomial.

24,2.3,The Gaussian Distribution,"The Gaussian, also known as the normal distribution, is a widely used model for the. distribution of continuous variables. In the case of a single variable x, the Gaussian. distribution can be written in the form. 1. (2.42). N (x|µ, σ2) =. (2πσ2)1/2. exp. 1. 2σ2 (x − µ)2. where µ is the mean and σ2 is the variance. For a D-dimensional vector x, the. multivariate Gaussian distribution takes the form. Section 1.6. Exercise 2.14. N (x|µ, Σ) =. 1. 1. (2π)D/2. |Σ|1/2. exp. 1. 2. (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ). (2.43). where µ is a D-dimensional mean vector, Σ is a D × D covariance matrix, and |Σ|. denotes the determinant of Σ.. The Gaussian distribution arises in many different contexts and can be motivated. from a variety of different perspectives. For example, we have already seen that for. a single real variable, the distribution that maximizes the entropy is the Gaussian.. This property applies also to the multivariate Gaussian.. Another situation in which the Gaussian distribution arises is when we consider. the sum of multiple random variables. The central limit theorem (due to Laplace). tells us that, subject to certain mild conditions, the sum of a set of random variables,. which is of course itself a random variable, has a distribution that becomes increas-. ingly Gaussian as the number of terms in the sum increases (Walker, 1969). We can. 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. 79. N = 1. 3. 2. 1. 0. 0. N = 2. 3. 2. 1. 0. 0. N = 10. 3. 2. 1. 0. 0. 0.5. 1. 0.5. 1. 0.5. 1. Figure 2.6 Histogram plots of the mean of N uniformly distributed numbers for various values of N. We. observe that as N increases, the distribution tends towards a Gaussian.. illustrate this by considering N variables x1, . . . , xN each of which has a uniform. distribution over the interval [0, 1] and then considering the distribution of the mean. (x1 + ··· + xN )/N. For large N, this distribution tends to a Gaussian, as illustrated. in Figure 2.6.. In practice, the convergence to a Gaussian as N increases can be. very rapid. One consequence of this result is that the binomial distribution (2.9),. which is a distribution over m defined by the sum of N observations of the random. binary variable x, will tend to a Gaussian as N → ∞ (see Figure 2.1 for the case of. N = 10).. The Gaussian distribution has many important analytical properties, and we shall. consider several of these in detail. As a result, this section will be rather more tech-. nically involved than some of the earlier sections, and will require familiarity with. various matrix identities. However, we strongly encourage the reader to become pro-. ficient in manipulating Gaussian distributions using the techniques presented here as. this will prove invaluable in understanding the more complex models presented in. later chapters.. We begin by considering the geometrical form of the Gaussian distribution. The. Appendix C. Carl Friedrich Gauss. 1777–1855. It. is said that when Gauss went. to elementary school at age 7, his. teacher B¨uttner, trying to keep the. class occupied, asked the pupils to. sum the integers from 1 to 100. To. the teacher’s amazement, Gauss. arrived at the answer in a matter of moments by noting. that the sum can be represented as 50 pairs (1 + 100,. 2+99, etc.) each of which added to 101, giving the an-. swer 5,050. It is now believed that the problem which. was actually set was of the same form but somewhat. harder in that the sequence had a larger starting value. and a larger increment. Gauss was a German math-. ematician and scientist with a reputation for being a. hard-working perfectionist. One of his many contribu-. tions was to show that least squares can be derived. under the assumption of normally distributed errors.. He also created an early formulation of non-Euclidean. geometry (a self-consistent geometrical theory that vi-. olates the axioms of Euclid) but was reluctant to dis-. cuss it openly for fear that his reputation might suffer. if it were seen that he believed in such a geometry.. At one point, Gauss was asked to conduct a geodetic. survey of the state of Hanover, which led to his for-. mulation of the normal distribution, now also known. as the Gaussian. After his death, a study of his di-. aries revealed that he had discovered several impor-. tant mathematical results years or even decades be-. fore they were published by others.. i=1. i=1. D. D.

Exercise 2.19. functional dependence of the Gaussian on x is through the quadratic form. ∆2 = (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ). (2.44). which appears in the exponent. The quantity ∆ is called the Mahalanobis distance. from µ to x and reduces to the Euclidean distance when Σ is the identity matrix. The. Gaussian distribution will be constant on surfaces in x-space for which this quadratic. form is constant.. First of all, we note that the matrix Σ can be taken to be symmetric, without. loss of generality, because any antisymmetric component would disappear from the. exponent. Now consider the eigenvector equation for the covariance matrix. where i = 1, . . . , D. Because Σ is a real, symmetric matrix its eigenvalues will be. real, and its eigenvectors can be chosen to form an orthonormal set, so that. where Iij is the i, j element of the identity matrix and satisfies. The covariance matrix Σ can be expressed as an expansion in terms of its eigenvec-. tors in the form. and similarly the inverse covariance matrix Σ−1 can be expressed as. Substituting (2.49) into (2.44), the quadratic form becomes. (2.45). (2.46). (2.47). (2.48). (2.49). (2.50). where we have defined. (2.51). We can interpret {yi} as a new coordinate system defined by the orthonormal vectors. ui that are shifted and rotated with respect to the original xi coordinates. Forming. the vector y = (y1, . . . , yD)T, we have. i (x − µ).. yi = uT. y = U(x − µ). (2.52). Appendix C. x2. Figure 2.7 The red curve shows the ellip-. tical surface of constant proba-. bility density for a Gaussian in. a two-dimensional space x =. (x1, x2) on which the density. its value at. is exp(−1/2) of. x = µ. The major axes of. the ellipse are defined by the. eigenvectors ui of the covari-. ance matrix, with correspond-. ing eigenvalues λi.. λ1/2. 2. 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. y2. u2. y1. u1. λ1/2. 1. 81. x1. where U is a matrix whose rows are given by uT. i . From (2.46) it follows that U is. an orthogonal matrix, i.e., it satisfies UUT = I, and hence also UTU = I, where I. is the identity matrix.. The quadratic form, and hence the Gaussian density, will be constant on surfaces. If all of the eigenvalues λi are positive, then these. for which (2.51) is constant.. surfaces represent ellipsoids, with their centres at µ and their axes oriented along ui,. and with scaling factors in the directions of the axes given by λ1/2. , as illustrated in. Figure 2.7.. i. For the Gaussian distribution to be well defined, it is necessary for all of the. eigenvalues λi of the covariance matrix to be strictly positive, otherwise the dis-. tribution cannot be properly normalized. A matrix whose eigenvalues are strictly. positive is said to be positive definite. In Chapter 12, we will encounter Gaussian. distributions for which one or more of the eigenvalues are zero, in which case the. distribution is singular and is confined to a subspace of lower dimensionality. If all. of the eigenvalues are nonnegative, then the covariance matrix is said to be positive. semidefinite.. Now consider the form of the Gaussian distribution in the new coordinate system. defined by the yi. In going from the x to the y coordinate system, we have a Jacobian. matrix J with elements given by. Jij = ∂xi. ∂yj. = Uji. (2.53). where Uji are the elements of the matrix UT. Using the orthonormality property of. the matrix U, we see that the square of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is. (2.54). and hence |J| = 1. Also, the determinant |Σ| of the covariance matrix can be written. = |I| = 1. |J|2 =. |U| =. UTU. UT. UT. 2 =. j=1. D. j=1. D. D. 82. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. as the product of its eigenvalues, and hence. |Σ|1/2 =. λ1/2. j. (2.55). (2.56). Thus in the yj coordinate system, the Gaussian distribution takes the form. p(y) = p(x)|J| =. 1. exp. (2πλj)1/2. y2. j. 2λj. which is the product of D independent univariate Gaussian distributions. The eigen-. vectors therefore define a new set of shifted and rotated coordinates with respect. to which the joint probability distribution factorizes into a product of independent. distributions. The integral of the distribution in the y coordinate system is then. p(y) dy =. j=1. 1. exp. (2πλj)1/2. y2. j. 2λj. dyj = 1. (2.57). where we have used the result (1.48) for the normalization of the univariate Gaussian.. This confirms that the multivariate Gaussian (2.43) is indeed normalized.. We now look at the moments of the Gaussian distribution and thereby provide an. interpretation of the parameters µ and Σ. The expectation of x under the Gaussian. distribution is given by. E[x] =. 1. (2π)D/2. 1. (2π)D/2. 1. 1. |Σ|1/2. |Σ|1/2. exp. exp. (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ). zTΣ−1z. (z + µ) dz. x dx. (2.58). 1. 2. 1. 2. where we have changed variables using z = x − µ. We now note that the exponent. is an even function of the components of z and, because the integrals over these are. taken over the range (−∞,∞), the term in z in the factor (z + µ) will vanish by. symmetry. Thus. (2.59). E[x] = µ. and so we refer to µ as the mean of the Gaussian distribution.. We now consider second order moments of the Gaussian. In the univariate case,. we considered the second order moment given by E[x2]. For the multivariate Gaus-. sian, there are D2 second order moments given by E[xixj], which we can group. together to form the matrix E[xxT]. This matrix can be written as. E[xxT] =. 1. (2π)D/2. 1. 1. 1. |Σ|1/2. (2π)D/2. |Σ|1/2. exp. 1. 2. (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ). xxT dx. exp. 1. 2. zTΣ−1z. (z + µ)(z + µ)T dz. D. i=1. yjuj. D. j=1. 1. 2. D. z =. j=1. i=1. D. k=1. D. 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. 83. where again we have changed variables using z = x − µ. Note that the cross-terms. involving µzT and µTz will again vanish by symmetry. The term µµT is constant. and can be taken outside the integral, which itself is unity because the Gaussian. distribution is normalized. Consider the term involving zzT. Again, we can make. use of the eigenvector expansion of the covariance matrix given by (2.45), together. with the completeness of the set of eigenvectors, to write. (2.60). (2.61). where yj = uT. j z, which gives. 1. (2π)D/2. 1. |Σ|1/2. 1.

Thus we have. E[xxT] = µµT + Σ.. (2.62). For single random variables, we subtracted the mean before taking second mo-. ments in order to define a variance. Similarly, in the multivariate case it is again. convenient to subtract off the mean, giving rise to the covariance of a random vector. x defined by. (2.63). For the specific case of a Gaussian distribution, we can make use of E[x] = µ,. together with the result (2.62), to give. (x − E[x])(x − E[x])T. cov[x] = E. cov[x] = Σ.. (2.64). Because the parameter matrix Σ governs the covariance of x under the Gaussian. distribution, it is called the covariance matrix.. Although the Gaussian distribution (2.43) is widely used as a density model, it. suffers from some significant limitations. Consider the number of free parameters in. the distribution. A general symmetric covariance matrix Σ will have D(D + 1)/2. independent parameters, and there are another D independent parameters in µ, giv-. ing D(D + 3)/2 parameters in total. For large D, the total number of parameters. Exercise 2.21. 84. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. Figure 2.8 Contours of constant. probability density for a Gaussian. distribution in two dimensions in. which the covariance matrix is (a) of. general form, (b) diagonal, in which. the elliptical contours are aligned. with the coordinate axes, and (c). proportional to the identity matrix, in. which the contours are concentric. circles.. x2. x2. x2. x1. x1. x1. (a). (b). (c). therefore grows quadratically with D, and the computational task of manipulating. and inverting large matrices can become prohibitive. One way to address this prob-. lem is to use restricted forms of the covariance matrix. If we consider covariance. matrices that are diagonal, so that Σ = diag(σ2. i ), we then have a total of 2D inde-. pendent parameters in the density model. The corresponding contours of constant. density are given by axis-aligned ellipsoids. We could further restrict the covariance. matrix to be proportional to the identity matrix, Σ = σ2I, known as an isotropic co-. variance, giving D + 1 independent parameters in the model and spherical surfaces. of constant density. The three possibilities of general, diagonal, and isotropic covari-. ance matrices are illustrated in Figure 2.8. Unfortunately, whereas such approaches. limit the number of degrees of freedom in the distribution and make inversion of the. covariance matrix a much faster operation, they also greatly restrict the form of the. probability density and limit its ability to capture interesting correlations in the data.. A further limitation of the Gaussian distribution is that it is intrinsically uni-. modal (i.e., has a single maximum) and so is unable to provide a good approximation. to multimodal distributions. Thus the Gaussian distribution can be both too flexible,. in the sense of having too many parameters, while also being too limited in the range. of distributions that it can adequately represent. We will see later that the introduc-. tion of latent variables, also called hidden variables or unobserved variables, allows. both of these problems to be addressed. In particular, a rich family of multimodal. distributions is obtained by introducing discrete latent variables leading to mixtures. of Gaussians, as discussed in Section 2.3.9. Similarly, the introduction of continuous. latent variables, as described in Chapter 12, leads to models in which the number of. free parameters can be controlled independently of the dimensionality D of the data. space while still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data. set. Indeed, these two approaches can be combined and further extended to derive. a very rich set of hierarchical models that can be adapted to a broad range of prac-. tical applications. For instance, the Gaussian version of the Markov random field,. which is widely used as a probabilistic model of images, is a Gaussian distribution. over the joint space of pixel intensities but rendered tractable through the imposition. of considerable structure reflecting the spatial organization of the pixels. Similarly,. the linear dynamical system, used to model time series data for applications such. as tracking, is also a joint Gaussian distribution over a potentially large number of. observed and latent variables and again is tractable due to the structure imposed on. the distribution.

In many situations, it will be convenient to work with the inverse of the covari-. ance matrix. Λ ≡ Σ−1. which is known as the precision matrix. In fact, we shall see that some properties. of Gaussian distributions are most naturally expressed in terms of the covariance,. whereas others take a simpler form when viewed in terms of the precision. We. therefore also introduce the partitioned form of the precision matrix. (2.66). (2.67). (2.68). 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. 85. such complex distributions is that of probabilistic graphical models, which will form. the subject of Chapter 8.. "
25,2.3.1,Conditional Gaussian distributions,"An important property of the multivariate Gaussian distribution is that if two. sets of variables are jointly Gaussian, then the conditional distribution of one set. conditioned on the other is again Gaussian. Similarly, the marginal distribution of. either set is also Gaussian.. Consider first the case of conditional distributions. Suppose x is a D-dimensional. vector with Gaussian distribution N (x|µ, Σ) and that we partition x into two dis-. joint subsets xa and xb. Without loss of generality, we can take xa to form the first. M components of x, with xb comprising the remaining D − M components, so that. (2.65). x =. xa. xb. We also define corresponding partitions of the mean vector µ given by. Exercise 2.22. Λaa Λab. Λba Λbb. (2.69). corresponding to the partitioning (2.65) of the vector x. Because the inverse of a. symmetric matrix is also symmetric, we see that Λaa and Λbb are symmetric, while. ab = Λba. It should be stressed at this point that, for instance, Λaa is not simply. ΛT. given by the inverse of Σaa. In fact, we shall shortly examine the relation between. the inverse of a partitioned matrix and the inverses of its partitions.. Let us begin by finding an expression for the conditional distribution p(xa|xb).. From the product rule of probability, we see that this conditional distribution can be. 86. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. evaluated from the joint distribution p(x) = p(xa, xb) simply by fixing xb to the. observed value and normalizing the resulting expression to obtain a valid probability. distribution over xa.. Instead of performing this normalization explicitly, we can. obtain the solution more efficiently by considering the quadratic form in the exponent. of the Gaussian distribution given by (2.44) and then reinstating the normalization. coefficient at the end of the calculation. If we make use of the partitioning (2.65),. (2.66), and (2.69), we obtain. 1. 2. (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ) =. (xa − µa)TΛaa(xa − µa) −. (xb − µb)TΛba(xa − µa) −. 1. 2. 1. 2. 1. (xa − µa)TΛab(xb − µb). 2. 1. (xb − µb)TΛbb(xb − µb).. 2. (2.70). We see that as a function of xa, this is again a quadratic form, and hence the cor-. responding conditional distribution p(xa|xb) will be Gaussian. Because this distri-. bution is completely characterized by its mean and its covariance, our goal will be. to identify expressions for the mean and covariance of p(xa|xb) by inspection of. (2.70).. This is an example of a rather common operation associated with Gaussian. distributions, sometimes called ‘completing the square’, in which we are given a. quadratic form defining the exponent terms in a Gaussian distribution, and we need. to determine the corresponding mean and covariance. Such problems can be solved. straightforwardly by noting that the exponent in a general Gaussian distribution. N (x|µ, Σ) can be written. xTΣ−1x + xTΣ−1µ + const. (2.71). 1. 2. (x − µ)TΣ−1(x − µ) = −. 1. 2. where ‘const’ denotes terms which are independent of x, and we have made use of. the symmetry of Σ. Thus if we take our general quadratic form and express it in. the form given by the right-hand side of (2.71), then we can immediately equate the. matrix of coefficients entering the second order term in x to the inverse covariance. matrix Σ−1 and the coefficient of the linear term in x to Σ−1µ, from which we can. obtain µ.. Now let us apply this procedure to the conditional Gaussian distribution p(xa|xb). for which the quadratic form in the exponent is given by (2.70). We will denote the. mean and covariance of this distribution by µa|b and Σa|b, respectively. Consider. the functional dependence of (2.70) on xa in which xb is regarded as a constant. If. we pick out all terms that are second order in xa, we have. 1. 2. a Λaaxa. xT. (2.72). from which we can immediately conclude that the covariance (inverse precision) of. p(xa|xb) is given by.

Note that the. mean of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb), given by (2.81), is a linear function of. xb and that the covariance, given by (2.82), is independent of xa. This represents an. example of a linear-Gaussian model.. Exercise 2.24. Section 8.1.4. 88. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. "
26,2.3.2,Marginal Gaussian distributions,"We have seen that if a joint distribution p(xa, xb) is Gaussian, then the condi-. tional distribution p(xa|xb) will again be Gaussian. Now we turn to a discussion of. the marginal distribution given by. p(xa) =. p(xa, xb) dxb. (2.83). which, as we shall see, is also Gaussian. Once again, our strategy for evaluating this. distribution efficiently will be to focus on the quadratic form in the exponent of the. joint distribution and thereby to identify the mean and covariance of the marginal. distribution p(xa).. The quadratic form for the joint distribution can be expressed, using the par-. titioned precision matrix, in the form (2.70). Because our goal is to integrate out. xb, this is most easily achieved by first considering the terms involving xb and then. completing the square in order to facilitate integration. Picking out just those terms. that involve xb, we have. 1. 2. b Λbbxb+xT. xT. where we have defined. b m = −. 1. 2.

Gaussian distribution corresponding to the first term on the right-hand side of (2.84),. plus a term that does not depend on xb (but that does depend on xa). Thus, when. we take the exponential of this quadratic form, we see that the integration over xb. required by (2.83) will take the form. exp. 1. 2. (xb − Λ−1. bb m)TΛbb(xb − Λ−1. bb m). dxb.. (2.86). This integration is easily performed by noting that it is the integral over an unnor-. malized Gaussian, and so the result will be the reciprocal of the normalization co-. efficient. We know from the form of the normalized Gaussian given by (2.43), that. this coefficient is independent of the mean and depends only on the determinant of. the covariance matrix. Thus, by completing the square with respect to xb, we can. integrate out xb and the only term remaining from the contributions on the left-hand. side of (2.84) that depends on xa is the last term on the right-hand side of (2.84) in. which m is given by (2.85). Combining this term with the remaining terms from. 89. (2.87). (2.88). (2.89). (2.90). (2.91). (2.92). (2.93). 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. (2.70) that depend on xa, we obtain. 1. 2.

Again, by comparison with. (2.71), we see that the covariance of the marginal distribution of p(xa) is given by. Similarly, the mean is given by. Σa = (Λaa − ΛabΛ−1. bb Λba)−1.. Σa(Λaa − ΛabΛ−1. bb Λba)µa = µa. where we have used (2.88). The covariance in (2.88) is expressed in terms of the. partitioned precision matrix given by (2.69). We can rewrite this in terms of the. corresponding partitioning of the covariance matrix given by (2.67), as we did for. the conditional distribution. These partitioned matrices are related by. Making use of (2.76), we then have. Thus we obtain the intuitively satisfying result that the marginal distribution p(xa). has mean and covariance given by. Λaa Λab. Λba Λbb. −1. Σaa Σab. Σba Σbb.

27,2.3.3,Bayes’ theorem for Gaussian variables,"In Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, we considered a Gaussian p(x) in which we parti-. tioned the vector x into two subvectors x = (xa, xb) and then found expressions for. the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) and the marginal distribution p(xa). We noted. that the mean of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) was a linear function of xb.. Here we shall suppose that we are given a Gaussian marginal distribution p(x) and a. Gaussian conditional distribution p(y|x) in which p(y|x) has a mean that is a linear. function of x, and a covariance which is independent of x. This is an example of. 1. 2. 1. 2. 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. 91. a linear Gaussian model (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999), which we shall study in. greater generality in Section 8.1.4. We wish to find the marginal distribution p(y). and the conditional distribution p(x|y). This is a problem that will arise frequently. in subsequent chapters, and it will prove convenient to derive the general results here.. We shall take the marginal and conditional distributions to be. p(x) = N. p(y|x) = N. x|µ, Λ−1. y|Ax + b, L−1. where µ, A, and b are parameters governing the means, and Λ and L are precision. matrices. If x has dimensionality M and y has dimensionality D, then the matrix A. has size D × M.. define. First we find an expression for the joint distribution over x and y. To do this, we. z =. x. y. and then consider the log of the joint distribution. ln p(z) = ln p(x) + ln p(y|x). (x − µ)TΛ(x − µ). (y − Ax − b)TL(y − Ax − b) + const. where ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x and y. As before, we see that this is a. quadratic function of the components of z, and hence p(z) is Gaussian distribution.. To find the precision of this Gaussian, we consider the second order terms in (2.102),. which can be written as. 1. xT(Λ + ATLA)x −. 2. x. y. 1. 2. T. 1. 2. yTLy +. 1. 2. yTLAx +. xTATLy.

(2.100). (2.101). (2.102). Exercise 2.29. The covariance matrix is found by taking the inverse of the precision, which can be. done using the matrix inversion formula (2.76) to give. cov[z] = R−1 =.

Similarly, we can find the mean of the Gaussian distribution over z by identify-. ing the linear terms in (2.102), which are given by. xTΛµ − xTATLb + yTLb =. T. x. y. Λµ − ATLb. Lb. Using our earlier result (2.71) obtained by completing the square over the quadratic. form of a multivariate Gaussian, we find that the mean of z is given by. Exercise 2.30.

Next we find an expression for the marginal distribution p(y) in which we have. marginalized over x. Recall that the marginal distribution over a subset of the com-. ponents of a Gaussian random vector takes a particularly simple form when ex-. pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Specifically, its mean and. covariance are given by (2.92) and (2.93), respectively. Making use of (2.105) and. (2.108) we see that the mean and covariance of the marginal distribution p(y) are. given by. E[y] = Aµ + b. cov[y] = L−1 + AΛ−1AT.. (2.109). (2.110). A special case of this result is when A = I, in which case it reduces to the convolu-. tion of two Gaussians, for which we see that the mean of the convolution is the sum. of the mean of the two Gaussians, and the covariance of the convolution is the sum. of their covariances.. Finally, we seek an expression for the conditional p(x|y). Recall that the results. for the conditional distribution are most easily expressed in terms of the partitioned. precision matrix, using (2.73) and (2.75). Applying these results to (2.105) and. (2.108) we see that the conditional distribution p(x|y) has mean and covariance. given by. E[x|y] = (Λ + ATLA)−1. cov[x|y] = (Λ + ATLA)−1.. ATL(y − b) + Λµ. (2.111). (2.112). The evaluation of this conditional can be seen as an example of Bayes’ theorem.. We can interpret the distribution p(x) as a prior distribution over x. If the variable. y is observed, then the conditional distribution p(x|y) represents the corresponding. posterior distribution over x. Having found the marginal and conditional distribu-. tions, we effectively expressed the joint distribution p(z) = p(x)p(y|x) in the form. p(x|y)p(y). These results are summarized below..

28,2.3.4,Maximum likelihood for the Gaussian,"Given a data set X = (x1, . . . , xN )T in which the observations {xn} are as-. sumed to be drawn independently from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, we can. estimate the parameters of the distribution by maximum likelihood.

(2.119). ln p(X|µ, Σ) =. Σ−1(xn − µ). (2.120). and setting this derivative to zero, we obtain the solution for the maximum likelihood. estimate of the mean given by. N. µML =. 1. N. xn. n=1.

The maximization of (2.118). with respect to Σ is rather more involved. The simplest approach is to ignore the. symmetry constraint and show that the resulting solution is symmetric as required.. Alternative derivations of this result, which impose the symmetry and positive defi-. niteness constraints explicitly, can be found in Magnus and Neudecker (1999). The. result is as expected and takes the form. ΣML =. 1. N. (xn − µML)(xn − µML)T. (2.122). which involves µML because this is the result of a joint maximization with respect. to µ and Σ. Note that the solution (2.121) for µML does not depend on ΣML, and so. we can first evaluate µML and then use this to evaluate ΣML.. If we evaluate the expectations of the maximum likelihood solutions under the. true distribution, we obtain the following results. E[µML] = µ. E[ΣML] = N − 1. N. (2.123). (2.124). We see that the expectation of the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean is equal. to the true mean. However, the maximum likelihood estimate for the covariance has. an expectation that is less than the true value, and hence it is biased. We can correct. this bias by defining a different estimator. Σ given by. N. 1. N − 1. n=1. (xn − µML)(xn − µML)T.. (2.125). Clearly from (2.122) and (2.124), the expectation of. Σ is equal to Σ.. "
29,2.3.5,Sequential estimation,"Our discussion of the maximum likelihood solution for the parameters of a Gaus-. sian distribution provides a convenient opportunity to give a more general discussion. of the topic of sequential estimation for maximum likelihood. Sequential methods. allow data points to be processed one at a time and then discarded and are important. for on-line applications, and also where large data sets are involved so that batch. processing of all data points at once is infeasible.. Consider the result (2.121) for the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean. ML when it is based on N observations. If we. µML, which we will denote by µ(N ). N. z.

Note that, as N increases,. so the contribution from successive data points gets smaller.. ML. ML. The result (2.126) will clearly give the same answer as the batch result (2.121). because the two formulae are equivalent. However, we will not always be able to de-. rive a sequential algorithm by this route, and so we seek a more general formulation. of sequential learning, which leads us to the Robbins-Monro algorithm. Consider a. pair of random variables θ and z governed by a joint distribution p(z, θ). The con-. ditional expectation of z given θ defines a deterministic function f(θ) that is given. by. f(θ) ≡ E[z|θ] =. zp(z|θ) dz. (2.127). and is illustrated schematically in Figure 2.10. Functions defined in this way are. called regression functions.. Our goal is to find the root θ at which f(θ) = 0. If we had a large data set. of observations of z and θ, then we could model the regression function directly and. then obtain an estimate of its root. Suppose, however, that we observe values of. z one at a time and we wish to find a corresponding sequential estimation scheme. for θ. The following general procedure for solving such problems was given by. N. N =1. N =1. N. n=1. 96. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. Robbins and Monro (1951). We shall assume that the conditional variance of z is. finite so that. (2.128). and we shall also, without loss of generality, consider the case where f(θ) > 0 for. θ > θ and f(θ) < 0 for θ < θ, as is the case in Figure 2.10. The Robbins-Monro. procedure then defines a sequence of successive estimates of the root θ given by. (z − f)2 | θ. E. θ(N ) = θ(N−1) + aN−1z(θ(N−1)). where z(θ(N )) is an observed value of z when θ takes the value θ(N ). The coefficients. {aN} represent a sequence of positive numbers that satisfy the conditions. (2.129). (2.130). (2.131). (2.132). lim. N→∞. aN = 0. aN = ∞. a2. N < ∞.. It can then be shown (Robbins and Monro, 1951; Fukunaga, 1990) that the sequence. of estimates given by (2.129) does indeed converge to the root with probability one.. Note that the first condition (2.130) ensures that the successive corrections decrease. in magnitude so that the process can converge to a limiting value. The second con-. dition (2.131) is required to ensure that the algorithm does not converge short of the. root, and the third condition (2.132) is needed to ensure that the accumulated noise. has finite variance and hence does not spoil convergence.. Now let us consider how a general maximum likelihood problem can be solved. sequentially using the Robbins-Monro algorithm. By definition, the maximum like-. lihood solution θML is a stationary point of the log likelihood function and hence. satisfies. 1. N. ln p(xn|θ). n=1. = 0.. θML. (2.133). Exchanging the derivative and the summation, and taking the limit N → ∞ we have. 1. N. lim. N→∞. ln p(xn|θ) = Ex. ln p(x|θ). (2.134). and so we see that finding the maximum likelihood solution corresponds to find-. ing the root of a regression function. We can therefore apply the Robbins-Monro. procedure, which now takes the form. θ(N ) = θ(N−1) + aN−1. ∂θ(N−1) ln p(xN|θ(N−1)).. (2.135). N. z. N. 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. Figure 2.11 In the case of a Gaussian distribution, with θ. corresponding to the mean µ, the regression. function illustrated in Figure 2.10 takes the form. of a straight line, as shown in red.. In this. case, the random variable z corresponds to the. derivative of the log likelihood function and is. given by (x − µML)/σ2, and its expectation that. defines the regression function is a straight line. given by (µ − µML)/σ2. The root of the regres-. sion function corresponds to the maximum like-. lihood estimator µML.. µML. 97. p(z|µ). As a specific example, we consider once again the sequential estimation of the. mean of a Gaussian distribution, in which case the parameter θ(N ) is the estimate. µ(N ).

Thus the distribution of z is Gaussian with mean µ − µML, as illustrated in Fig-. ure 2.11. Substituting (2.136) into (2.135), we obtain the univariate form of (2.126),. provided we choose the coefficients aN to have the form aN = σ2/N. Note that. although we have focussed on the case of a single variable, the same technique,. together with the same restrictions (2.130)–(2.132) on the coefficients aN , apply. equally to the multivariate case (Blum, 1965).. "
30,2.3.6,Bayesian inference for the Gaussian,"The maximum likelihood framework gave point estimates for the parameters µ. and Σ. Now we develop a Bayesian treatment by introducing prior distributions. over these parameters. Let us begin with a simple example in which we consider a. single Gaussian random variable x. We shall suppose that the variance σ2 is known,. and we consider the task of inferring the mean µ given a set of N observations. X = {x1, . . . , xN}. The likelihood function, that is the probability of the observed. data given µ, viewed as a function of µ, is given by. p(X|µ) =. p(xn|µ) =. n=1. 1. (2πσ2)N/2. exp. 1. 2σ2. (xn − µ)2. n=1. (2.137). Again we emphasize that the likelihood function p(X|µ) is not a probability distri-. bution over µ and is not normalized.. We see that the likelihood function takes the form of the exponential of a quad-. ratic form in µ. Thus if we choose a prior p(µ) given by a Gaussian, it will be a. N. p(µ) = N. and the posterior distribution is given by. µ|µ0, σ2. 0. p(µ|X) ∝ p(X|µ)p(µ).. where. p(µ|X) = N. µ|µN , σ2. N. µN =. 1. σ2. N. 0. σ2. 0 + σ2 µ0 + N σ2. + N. σ2. N σ2.

It is worth spending a moment studying the form of the posterior mean and. variance. First of all, we note that the mean of the posterior distribution given by. (2.141) is a compromise between the prior mean µ0 and the maximum likelihood. solution µML. If the number of observed data points N = 0, then (2.141) reduces. to the prior mean as expected. For N → ∞, the posterior mean is given by the. maximum likelihood solution. Similarly, consider the result (2.142) for the variance. of the posterior distribution. We see that this is most naturally expressed in terms. of the inverse variance, which is called the precision. Furthermore, the precisions. are additive, so that the precision of the posterior is given by the precision of the. prior plus one contribution of the data precision from each of the observed data. points. As we increase the number of observed data points, the precision steadily. increases, corresponding to a posterior distribution with steadily decreasing variance.. With no observed data points, we have the prior variance, whereas if the number of. N goes to zero and the posterior distribution. data points N → ∞, the variance σ2. becomes infinitely peaked around the maximum likelihood solution. We therefore. see that the maximum likelihood result of a point estimate for µ given by (2.143) is. recovered precisely from the Bayesian formalism in the limit of an infinite number. of observations. Note also that for finite N, if we take the limit σ2. 0 → ∞ in which the. prior has infinite variance then the posterior mean (2.141) reduces to the maximum. N = σ2/N.. likelihood result, while from (2.142) the posterior variance is given by σ2. 98. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. conjugate distribution for this likelihood function because the corresponding poste-. rior will be a product of two exponentials of quadratic functions of µ and hence will. also be Gaussian.

We illustrate our analysis of Bayesian inference for the mean of a Gaussian. distribution in Figure 2.12. The generalization of this result to the case of a D-. dimensional Gaussian random variable x with known covariance and unknown mean. is straightforward.. We have already seen how the maximum likelihood expression for the mean of. a Gaussian can be re-cast as a sequential update formula in which the mean after. observing N data points was expressed in terms of the mean after observing N − 1. data points together with the contribution from data point xN . In fact, the Bayesian. paradigm leads very naturally to a sequential view of the inference problem. To see. this in the context of the inference of the mean of a Gaussian, we write the posterior. distribution with the contribution from the final data point xN separated out so that. p(µ|D) ∝. p(µ). p(xn|µ). p(xN|µ).. (2.144). The term in square brackets is (up to a normalization coefficient) just the posterior. distribution after observing N − 1 data points. We see that this can be viewed as. a prior distribution, which is combined using Bayes’ theorem with the likelihood. function associated with data point xN to arrive at the posterior distribution after. observing N data points. This sequential view of Bayesian inference is very general. and applies to any problem in which the observed data are assumed to be independent. and identically distributed.. So far, we have assumed that the variance of the Gaussian distribution over the. data is known and our goal is to infer the mean. Now let us suppose that the mean. is known and we wish to infer the variance. Again, our calculations will be greatly. simplified if we choose a conjugate form for the prior distribution. It turns out to be. most convenient to work with the precision λ ≡ 1/σ2. The likelihood function for λ. takes the form. p(X|λ) =. n=1. N (xn|µ, λ−1) ∝ λN/2 exp. (xn − µ)2. n=1. (2.145). 2. 2. 1. 0.

The mean and variance of the gamma distribution are given by. E[λ] = a. b. var[λ] = a. b2 .. (2.147). (2.148). Consider a prior distribution Gam(λ|a0, b0).

Thus we can interpret the parameter a0 in. the prior in terms of 2a0 ‘effective’ prior observations. Similarly, from (2.151) we. see that the N data points contribute N σ2. ML is. the variance, and so we can interpret the parameter b0 in the prior as arising from. the 2a0 ‘effective’ prior observations having variance 2b0/(2a0) = b0/a0. Recall. that we made an analogous interpretation for the Dirichlet prior. These distributions. are examples of the exponential family, and we shall see that the interpretation of. a conjugate prior in terms of effective fictitious data points is a general one for the. exponential family of distributions.. ML/2 to the parameter b, where σ2. Instead of working with the precision, we can consider the variance itself. The. conjugate prior in this case is called the inverse gamma distribution, although we. shall not discuss this further because we will find it more convenient to work with. the precision.. Now suppose that both the mean and the precision are unknown. To find a. conjugate prior, we consider the dependence of the likelihood function on µ and λ. p(X|µ, λ) =. 1/2. 2π. exp. N. 2. (xn − µ)2. λ1/2 exp. λµ2. 2. exp. xn −. 2. x2. n. (2.152).

(µ − c/β)2. λβ/2 exp. d −. c2. 2β. (2.153). where c, d, and β are constants. Since we can always write p(µ, λ) = p(µ|λ)p(λ),. we can find p(µ|λ) and p(λ) by inspection. In particular, we see that p(µ|λ) is a. Gaussian whose precision is a linear function of λ and that p(λ) is a gamma distri-. bution, so that the normalized prior takes the form. p(µ, λ) = N (µ|µ0, (βλ)−1)Gam(λ|a, b). (2.154). where we have defined new constants given by µ0 = c/β, a = 1 + β/2, b =. d−c2/2β. The distribution (2.154) is called the normal-gamma or Gaussian-gamma. distribution and is plotted in Figure 2.14. Note that this is not simply the product. of an independent Gaussian prior over µ and a gamma prior over λ, because the. precision of µ is a linear function of λ. Even if we chose a prior in which µ and λ. were independent, the posterior distribution would exhibit a coupling between the. precision of µ and the value of λ.. 2. 0. D. 102. 2.

In the case of the multivariate Gaussian distribution N. for a D-. dimensional variable x, the conjugate prior distribution for the mean µ, assuming. the precision is known, is again a Gaussian.

Again, it is also possible to define a conjugate prior over the covariance matrix itself,. rather than over the precision matrix, which leads to the inverse Wishart distribu-. tion, although we shall not discuss this further. If both the mean and the precision. are unknown, then, following a similar line of reasoning to the univariate case, the. conjugate prior is given by. p(µ, Λ|µ0, β, W, ν) = N (µ|µ0, (βΛ)−1)W(Λ|W, ν). (2.157). which is known as the normal-Wishart or Gaussian-Wishart distribution.. "
31,2.3.7,Student’s t-distribution,"We have seen that the conjugate prior for the precision of a Gaussian is given. by a gamma distribution. If we have a univariate Gaussian N (x|µ, τ−1) together. with a Gamma prior Gam(τ|a, b) and we integrate out the precision, we obtain the. marginal distribution of x in the form. Section 2.3.6.

The parameter λ is sometimes called the. precision of the t-distribution, even though it is not in general equal to the inverse. of the variance. The parameter ν is called the degrees of freedom, and its effect is. illustrated in Figure 2.15. For the particular case of ν = 1, the t-distribution reduces. to the Cauchy distribution, while in the limit ν → ∞ the t-distribution St(x|µ, λ, ν). becomes a Gaussian N (x|µ, λ−1) with mean µ and precision λ.. From (2.158), we see that Student’s t-distribution is obtained by adding up an. infinite number of Gaussian distributions having the same mean but different preci-. sions. This can be interpreted as an infinite mixture of Gaussians (Gaussian mixtures. will be discussed in detail in Section 2.3.9. The result is a distribution that in gen-. eral has longer ‘tails’ than a Gaussian, as was seen in Figure 2.15. This gives the t-. distribution an important property called robustness, which means that it is much less. sensitive than the Gaussian to the presence of a few data points which are outliers.. The robustness of the t-distribution is illustrated in Figure 2.16, which compares the. maximum likelihood solutions for a Gaussian and a t-distribution. Note that the max-. imum likelihood solution for the t-distribution can be found using the expectation-. maximization (EM) algorithm. Here we see that the effect of a small number of. Exercise 2.47.

(b) The same data set but with three additional outlying data points showing how the Gaussian (green curve) is. strongly distorted by the outliers, whereas the t-distribution (red curve) is relatively unaffected.. outliers is much less significant for the t-distribution than for the Gaussian. Outliers. can arise in practical applications either because the process that generates the data. corresponds to a distribution having a heavy tail or simply through mislabelled data.. Robustness is also an important property for regression problems. Unsurprisingly,. the least squares approach to regression does not exhibit robustness, because it cor-. responds to maximum likelihood under a (conditional) Gaussian distribution. By. basing a regression model on a heavy-tailed distribution such as a t-distribution, we. obtain a more robust model.. If we go back to (2.158) and substitute the alternative parameters ν = 2a, λ =. a/b, and η = τ b/a, we see that the t-distribution can be written in the form. St(x|µ, λ, ν) =. x|µ, (ηλ)−1.

32,2.3.8,Periodic variables,"Although Gaussian distributions are of great practical significance, both in their. own right and as building blocks for more complex probabilistic models, there are. situations in which they are inappropriate as density models for continuous vari-. ables. One important case, which arises in practical applications, is that of periodic. variables.. An example of a periodic variable would be the wind direction at a particular. geographical location. We might, for instance, measure values of wind direction on a. number of days and wish to summarize this using a parametric distribution. Another. example is calendar time, where we may be interested in modelling quantities that. are believed to be periodic over 24 hours or over an annual cycle. Such quantities. can conveniently be represented using an angular (polar) coordinate 0 � θ < 2π.. We might be tempted to treat periodic variables by choosing some direction. as the origin and then applying a conventional distribution such as the Gaussian.. Such an approach, however, would give results that were strongly dependent on the. arbitrary choice of origin. Suppose, for instance, that we have two observations at. θ1 = 1◦ and θ2 = 359◦, and we model them using a standard univariate Gaussian. distribution. If we choose the origin at 0◦, then the sample mean of this data set. will be 180◦ with standard deviation 179◦, whereas if we choose the origin at 180◦,. then the mean will be 0◦ and the standard deviation will be 1◦. We clearly need to. develop a special approach for the treatment of periodic variables.. Let us consider the problem of evaluating the mean of a set of observations. D = {θ1, . . . , θN} of a periodic variable. From now on, we shall assume that θ is. measured in radians. We have already seen that the simple average (θ1+···+θN )/N. will be strongly coordinate dependent. To find an invariant measure of the mean, we. note that the observations can be viewed as points on the unit circle and can therefore. be described instead by two-dimensional unit vectors x1, . . . , xN where xn = 1. for n = 1, . . . , N, as illustrated in Figure 2.17. We can average the vectors {xn}. 1. N. n=1. N. N. x2. N. 106. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS.

Clearly, this definition will. ensure that the location of the mean is independent of the origin of the angular coor-. dinate. Note that x will typically lie inside the unit circle. The Cartesian coordinates. of the observations are given by xn = (cos θn, sin θn), and we can write the Carte-. sian coordinates of the sample mean in the form x = (r cos θ, r sin θ). Substituting. into (2.167) and equating the x1 and x2 components then gives. r cos θ =. 1. N. cos θn,. n=1. r sin θ =. 1. N. sin θn.. (2.168). n=1. Taking the ratio, and using the identity tan θ = sin θ/ cos θ, we can solve for θ to. give. θ = tan−1. (2.169). n sin θn. n cos θn. Shortly, we shall see how this result arises naturally as the maximum likelihood. estimator for an appropriately defined distribution over a periodic variable.. We now consider a periodic generalization of the Gaussian called the von Mises. distribution. Here we shall limit our attention to univariate distributions, although. periodic distributions can also be found over hyperspheres of arbitrary dimension.. For an extensive discussion of periodic distributions, see Mardia and Jupp (2000).. By convention, we will consider distributions p(θ) that have period 2π. Any. probability density p(θ) defined over θ must not only be nonnegative and integrate. x2. 107. p(x). x1. (2.170). (2.171). (2.172). (2.174). (2.175). (2.176). 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. Figure 2.18 The von Mises distribution can be derived by considering. a two-dimensional Gaussian of the form (2.173), whose. density contours are shown in blue and conditioning on. the unit circle shown in red.. to one, but it must also be periodic. Thus p(θ) must satisfy the three conditions. r = 1. p(θ) � 0. p(θ) dθ = 1. 2π. 0. p(θ + 2π) = p(θ).. From (2.172), it follows that p(θ + M2π) = p(θ) for any integer M.. We can easily obtain a Gaussian-like distribution that satisfies these three prop-. erties as follows. Consider a Gaussian distribution over two variables x = (x1, x2). having mean µ = (µ1, µ2) and a covariance matrix Σ = σ2I where I is the 2 × 2. identity matrix, so that. p(x1, x2) =. 1. 2πσ2 exp. (x1 − µ1)2 + (x2 − µ2)2. 2σ2. (2.173). The contours of constant p(x) are circles, as illustrated in Figure 2.18. Now suppose. we consider the value of this distribution along a circle of fixed radius. Then by con-. struction this distribution will be periodic, although it will not be normalized. We can. determine the form of this distribution by transforming from Cartesian coordinates. (x1, x2) to polar coordinates (r, θ) so that. x2 = r sin θ.. We also map the mean µ into polar coordinates by writing. x1 = r cos θ,. µ1 = r0 cos θ0,. µ2 = r0 sin θ0.. Next we substitute these transformations into the two-dimensional Gaussian distribu-. tion (2.173), and then condition on the unit circle r = 1, noting that we are interested. only in the dependence on θ. Focussing on the exponent in the Gaussian distribution. we have. 1. 2σ2. = r0.

(2.179). which is called the von Mises distribution, or the circular normal. Here the param-. eter θ0 corresponds to the mean of the distribution, while m, which is known as. the concentration parameter, is analogous to the inverse variance (precision) for the. Gaussian. The normalization coefficient in (2.179) is expressed in terms of I0(m),. which is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind (Abramowitz and Stegun,. 1965) and is defined by. I0(m) =. 1. 2π. 2π. 0. exp{m cos θ} dθ.. (2.180). For large m, the distribution becomes approximately Gaussian. The von Mises dis-. tribution is plotted in Figure 2.19, and the function I0(m) is plotted in Figure 2.20.. Now consider the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters θ0 and m. for the von Mises distribution. The log likelihood function is given by. ln p(D|θ0, m) = −N ln(2π) − N ln I0(m) + m. cos(θn − θ0).. n=1. (2.181). 2.3. The Gaussian Distribution. n=1. N. 1. 0.5. n=1. N. 0. 0. 0. N. 5. m. N.

Note that. this distribution fails to capture the. two clumps in the data and indeed. places much of its probability mass. in the central region between the. clumps where the data are relatively. sparse. On the right the distribution. is given by a linear combination of. two Gaussians which has been fitted. to the data by maximum likelihood. using techniques discussed Chap-. ter 9, and which gives a better rep-. resentation of the data.. 100. 80. 60. 40. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. The right-hand side of (2.187) is easily evaluated, and the function A(m) can be. inverted numerically.. For completeness, we mention briefly some alternative techniques for the con-. struction of periodic distributions. The simplest approach is to use a histogram of. observations in which the angular coordinate is divided into fixed bins. This has the. virtue of simplicity and flexibility but also suffers from significant limitations, as we. shall see when we discuss histogram methods in more detail in Section 2.5. Another. approach starts, like the von Mises distribution, from a Gaussian distribution over a. Euclidean space but now marginalizes onto the unit circle rather than conditioning. (Mardia and Jupp, 2000). However, this leads to more complex forms of distribution. and will not be discussed further. Finally, any valid distribution over the real axis. (such as a Gaussian) can be turned into a periodic distribution by mapping succes-. sive intervals of width 2π onto the periodic variable (0, 2π), which corresponds to. ‘wrapping’ the real axis around unit circle. Again, the resulting distribution is more. complex to handle than the von Mises distribution.. One limitation of the von Mises distribution is that it is unimodal. By forming. mixtures of von Mises distributions, we obtain a flexible framework for modelling. periodic variables that can handle multimodality. For an example of a machine learn-. ing application that makes use of von Mises distributions, see Lawrence et al. (2002),. and for extensions to modelling conditional densities for regression problems, see. Bishop and Nabney (1996).. "
33,2.3.9,Mixtures of Gaussians,"While the Gaussian distribution has some important analytical properties, it suf-. fers from significant limitations when it comes to modelling real data sets. Consider. the example shown in Figure 2.21. This is known as the ‘Old Faithful’ data set,. and comprises 272 measurements of the eruption of the Old Faithful geyser at Yel-. lowstone National Park in the USA. Each measurement comprises the duration of. Appendix A. k=1. K. K. the eruption in minutes (horizontal axis) and the time in minutes to the next erup-. tion (vertical axis). We see that the data set forms two dominant clumps, and that. a simple Gaussian distribution is unable to capture this structure, whereas a linear. superposition of two Gaussians gives a better characterization of the data set.. Such superpositions, formed by taking linear combinations of more basic dis-. tributions such as Gaussians, can be formulated as probabilistic models known as. mixture distributions (McLachlan and Basford, 1988; McLachlan and Peel, 2000).. In Figure 2.22 we see that a linear combination of Gaussians can give rise to very. complex densities. By using a sufficient number of Gaussians, and by adjusting their. means and covariances as well as the coefficients in the linear combination, almost. any continuous density can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy.. We therefore consider a superposition of K Gaussian densities of the form. p(x) =. πkN (x|µk, Σk). (2.188). which is called a mixture of Gaussians. Each Gaussian density N (x|µk, Σk) is. called a component of the mixture and has its own mean µk and covariance Σk.. Contour and surface plots for a Gaussian mixture having 3 components are shown in. Figure 2.23.. In this section we shall consider Gaussian components to illustrate the frame-. work of mixture models. More generally, mixture models can comprise linear com-. binations of other distributions. For instance, in Section 9.3.3 we shall consider. mixtures of Bernoulli distributions as an example of a mixture model for discrete. variables.. The parameters πk in (2.188) are called mixing coefficients. If we integrate both. sides of (2.188) with respect to x, and note that both p(x) and the individual Gaussian. components are normalized, we obtain. πk = 1.. k=1. (2.189). Also, the requirement that p(x) � 0, together with N (x|µk, Σk) � 0, implies. πk � 0 for all k. Combining this with the condition (2.189) we obtain. 0 � πk � 1.. (2.190). 2.3.

(b) Contours of the marginal probability. density p(x) of the mixture distribution. (c) A surface plot of the distribution p(x).. We therefore see that the mixing coefficients satisfy the requirements to be probabil-. ities.. From the sum and product rules, the marginal density is given by. p(x) =. p(k)p(x|k). (2.191). which is equivalent to (2.188) in which we can view πk = p(k) as the prior prob-. ability of picking the kth component, and the density N (x|µk, Σk) = p(x|k) as. the probability of x conditioned on k. As we shall see in later chapters, an impor-. tant role is played by the posterior probabilities p(k|x), which are also known as. responsibilities. From Bayes’ theorem these are given by. γk(x) ≡ p(k|x). p(k)p(x|k). l p(l)p(x|l). πkN (x|µk, Σk). l πlN (x|µl, Σl) .. (2.192). We shall discuss the probabilistic interpretation of the mixture distribution in greater. detail in Chapter 9.. The form of the Gaussian mixture distribution is governed by the parameters π,. µ and Σ, where we have used the notation π ≡ {π1, . . . , πK}, µ ≡ {µ1, . . . , µK}. and Σ ≡ {Σ1, . . . ΣK}. One way to set the values of these parameters is to use. maximum likelihood. From (2.188) the log of the likelihood function is given by. ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) =. ln. n=1. k=1. πkN (xn|µk, Σk). (2.193). "
34,2.4,The Exponential Family,"113. where X = {x1, . . . , xN}. We immediately see that the situation is now much. more complex than with a single Gaussian, due to the presence of the summation. over k inside the logarithm. As a result, the maximum likelihood solution for the. parameters no longer has a closed-form analytical solution. One approach to maxi-. mizing the likelihood function is to use iterative numerical optimization techniques. (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Alterna-. tively we can employ a powerful framework called expectation maximization, which. will be discussed at length in Chapter 9.. 2.4. The Exponential Family. The probability distributions that we have studied so far in this chapter (with the. exception of the Gaussian mixture) are specific examples of a broad class of distri-. butions called the exponential family (Duda and Hart, 1973; Bernardo and Smith,. 1994). Members of the exponential family have many important properties in com-. mon, and it is illuminating to discuss these properties in some generality.. The exponential family of distributions over x, given parameters η, is defined to. be the set of distributions of the form. p(x|η) = h(x)g(η) exp. ηTu(x). (2.194). where x may be scalar or vector, and may be discrete or continuous. Here η are. called the natural parameters of the distribution, and u(x) is some function of x.. The function g(η) can be interpreted as the coefficient that ensures that the distribu-. tion is normalized and therefore satisfies. g(η). h(x) exp. ηTu(x). dx = 1. (2.195). where the integration is replaced by summation if x is a discrete variable.. We begin by taking some examples of the distributions introduced earlier in. the chapter and showing that they are indeed members of the exponential family.. Consider first the Bernoulli distribution. p(x|µ) = Bern(x|µ) = µx(1 − µ)1−x.. Expressing the right-hand side as the exponential of the logarithm, we have. p(x|µ) = exp{x ln µ + (1 − x) ln(1 − µ)}. ln. x. = (1 − µ) exp. 1 − µ. Comparison with (2.194) allows us to identify.

Thus we can write the Bernoulli distribution. using the standard representation (2.194) in the form. p(x|η) = σ(−η) exp(ηx). (2.200). where we have used 1 − σ(η) = σ(−η), which is easily proved from (2.199). Com-. parison with (2.194) shows that. Next consider the multinomial distribution that, for a single observation x, takes. the form. p(x|µ) =. k=1. µxk. k = exp. xk ln µk. (2.204). where x = (x1, . . . , xN )T. Again, we can write this in the standard representation. (2.194) so that. (2.205). where ηk = ln µk, and we have defined η = (η1, . . . , ηM )T. Again, comparing with. (2.194) we have. p(x|η) = exp(ηTx). Note that the parameters ηk are not independent because the parameters µk are sub-. ject to the constraint. so that, given any M − 1 of the parameters µk, the value of the remaining parameter. is fixed. In some circumstances, it will be convenient to remove this constraint by. expressing the distribution in terms of only M − 1 parameters. This can be achieved. by using the relationship (2.209) to eliminate µM by expressing it in terms of the. remaining {µk} where k = 1, . . . , M − 1, thereby leaving M − 1 parameters. Note. that these remaining parameters are still subject to the constraints. 0 � µk � 1,. µk � 1.. (2.210). (2.199). (2.201). (2.202). (2.203). (2.206). (2.207). (2.208). (2.209). M. ln. µk.

This is called the softmax function, or the normalized exponential. In this represen-. tation, the multinomial distribution therefore takes the form. p(x|η) =. 1 +. −1. exp(ηTx).. (2.214). This is the standard form of the exponential family, with parameter vector η =. (η1, . . . , ηM−1)T in which. u(x) = x. h(x) = 1. g(η) =. 1 +. exp(ηk). −1. (2.215). (2.216). (2.217).

35,2.4.1,Maximum likelihood and sufficient statistics,"Let us now consider the problem of estimating the parameter vector η in the gen-. eral exponential family distribution (2.194) using the technique of maximum likeli-. hood. Taking the gradient of both sides of (2.195) with respect to η, we have. h(x) exp. ηTu(x). ∇g(η). + g(η). h(x) exp. ηTu(x). u(x) dx = 0.. Rearranging, and making use again of (2.195) then gives. 1. g(η)∇g(η) = g(η). h(x) exp. ηTu(x). u(x) dx = E[u(x)]. where we have used (2.194). We therefore obtain the result. −∇ ln g(η) = E[u(x)].. Note that the covariance of u(x) can be expressed in terms of the second derivatives. of g(η), and similarly for higher order moments. Thus, provided we can normalize a. distribution from the exponential family, we can always find its moments by simple. differentiation.. Now consider a set of independent identically distributed data denoted by X =. {x1, . . . , xn}, for which the likelihood function is given by. p(X|η) =. h(xn). n=1. g(η)N exp. u(xn). (2.227). n=1. Setting the gradient of ln p(X|η) with respect to η to zero, we get the following. condition to be satisfied by the maximum likelihood estimator ηML. −∇ ln g(ηML) =. 1. N. u(xn). n=1. (2.228). N. 2.4. The Exponential Family. 117. which can in principle be solved to obtain ηML. We see that the solution for the. n u(xn), which. maximum likelihood estimator depends on the data only through. is therefore called the sufficient statistic of the distribution (2.194). We do not need. to store the entire data set itself but only the value of the sufficient statistic. For. the Bernoulli distribution, for example, the function u(x) is given just by x and. so we need only keep the sum of the data points {xn}, whereas for the Gaussian. u(x) = (x, x2)T, and so we should keep both the sum of {xn} and the sum of {x2. n}.. If we consider the limit N → ∞, then the right-hand side of (2.228) becomes. E[u(x)], and so by comparing with (2.226) we see that in this limit ηML will equal. the true value η.. In fact, this sufficiency property holds also for Bayesian inference, although. we shall defer discussion of this until Chapter 8 when we have equipped ourselves. with the tools of graphical models and can thereby gain a deeper insight into these. important concepts.. "
36,2.4.2,Conjugate priors,"We have already encountered the concept of a conjugate prior several times, for. example in the context of the Bernoulli distribution (for which the conjugate prior. is the beta distribution) or the Gaussian (where the conjugate prior for the mean is. a Gaussian, and the conjugate prior for the precision is the Wishart distribution). In. general, for a given probability distribution p(x|η), we can seek a prior p(η) that is. conjugate to the likelihood function, so that the posterior distribution has the same. functional form as the prior. For any member of the exponential family (2.194), there. exists a conjugate prior that can be written in the form. p(η|χ, ν) = f(χ, ν)g(η)ν exp. (2.229). νηTχ. where f(χ, ν) is a normalization coefficient, and g(η) is the same function as ap-. pears in (2.194). To see that this is indeed conjugate, let us multiply the prior (2.229). by the likelihood function (2.227) to obtain the posterior distribution, up to a nor-. malization coefficient, in the form. p(η|X, χ, ν) ∝ g(η)ν+N exp. ηT. n=1. u(xn) + νχ. (2.230). This again takes the same functional form as the prior (2.229), confirming conjugacy.. Furthermore, we see that the parameter ν can be interpreted as a effective number of. pseudo-observations in the prior, each of which has a value for the sufficient statistic. u(x) given by χ.. "
37,2.4.3,Noninformative priors,"In some applications of probabilistic inference, we may have prior knowledge. that can be conveniently expressed through the prior distribution. For example, if. the prior assigns zero probability to some value of variable, then the posterior dis-. tribution will necessarily also assign zero probability to that value, irrespective of.  dλ. dη. 118. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. any subsequent observations of data. In many cases, however, we may have little. idea of what form the distribution should take. We may then seek a form of prior. distribution, called a noninformative prior, which is intended to have as little influ-. ence on the posterior distribution as possible (Jeffries, 1946; Box and Tao, 1973;. Bernardo and Smith, 1994). This is sometimes referred to as ‘letting the data speak. for themselves’.. If we have a distribution p(x|λ) governed by a parameter λ, we might be tempted. to propose a prior distribution p(λ) = const as a suitable prior. If λ is a discrete. variable with K states, this simply amounts to setting the prior probability of each. state to 1/K. In the case of continuous parameters, however, there are two potential. difficulties with this approach. The first is that, if the domain of λ is unbounded,. this prior distribution cannot be correctly normalized because the integral over λ. diverges. Such priors are called improper. In practice, improper priors can often. be used provided the corresponding posterior distribution is proper, i.e., that it can. be correctly normalized. For instance, if we put a uniform prior distribution over. the mean of a Gaussian, then the posterior distribution for the mean, once we have. observed at least one data point, will be proper.. A second difficulty arises from the transformation behaviour of a probability. density under a nonlinear change of variables, given by (1.27). If a function h(λ). is constant, and we change variables to λ = η2, then. h(η) = h(η2) will also be. constant. However, if we choose the density pλ(λ) to be constant, then the density. of η will be given, from (1.27), by. pη(η) = pλ(λ). = pλ(η2)2η ∝ η. (2.231). and so the density over η will not be constant. This issue does not arise when we use. maximum likelihood, because the likelihood function p(x|λ) is a simple function of. λ and so we are free to use any convenient parameterization. If, however, we are to. choose a prior distribution that is constant, we must take care to use an appropriate. representation for the parameters.. Here we consider two simple examples of noninformative priors (Berger, 1985).. First of all, if a density takes the form. p(x|µ) = f(x − µ). (2.232). then the parameter µ is known as a location parameter. This family of densities. x = x + c,. exhibits translation invariance because if we shift x by a constant to give. then. µ) = f(. (2.233). µ = µ + c. Thus the density takes the same form in the. where we have defined. new variable as in the original one, and so the density is independent of the choice. of origin. We would like to choose a prior distribution that reflects this translation. invariance property, and so we choose a prior that assigns equal probability mass to. x −. p(. x|. x. x. 1. 2.4.

A. p(µ − c) dµ. and because this must hold for all choices of A and B, we have. p(µ − c) = p(µ). which implies that p(µ) is constant. An example of a location parameter would be. the mean µ of a Gaussian distribution. As we have seen, the conjugate prior distri-. bution for µ in this case is a Gaussian p(µ|µ0, σ2. 0), and we obtain a. noninformative prior by taking the limit σ2. 0 → ∞. Indeed, from (2.141) and (2.142). we see that this gives a posterior distribution over µ in which the contributions from. the prior vanish.. 0) = N (µ|µ0, σ2. As a second example, consider a density of the form. Exercise 2.59. where σ > 0. Note that this will be a normalized density provided f(x) is correctly. normalized. The parameter σ is known as a scale parameter, and the density exhibits. scale invariance because if we scale x by a constant to give. x = cx, then. p(x|σ) =. 1. f. p(. x|. f. (2.234). (2.235). (2.236). (2.237). σ = cσ. This transformation corresponds to a change of. where we have defined. scale, for example from meters to kilometers if x is a length, and we would like. to choose a prior distribution that reflects this scale invariance. If we consider an. interval A � σ � B, and a scaled interval A/c � σ � B/c, then the prior should. assign equal probability mass to these two intervals. Thus we have. B. A. p(σ) dσ =. B/c. A/c. p(σ) dσ =. B. A. p. 1. c. 1. c. dσ. (2.238). and because this must hold for choices of A and B, we have. p(σ) = p. 1. c. 1. c. (2.239). and hence p(σ) ∝ 1/σ. Note that again this is an improper prior because the integral. of the distribution over 0 � σ � ∞ is divergent. It is sometimes also convenient. to think of the prior distribution for a scale parameter in terms of the density of the. log of the parameter. Using the transformation rule (1.27) for densities we see that. p(ln σ) = const. Thus, for this prior there is the same probability mass in the range. 1 � σ � 10 as in the range 10 � σ � 100 and in 100 � σ � 1000.. 120. Section 2.3. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. An example of a scale parameter would be the standard deviation σ of a Gaussian. distribution, after we have taken account of the location parameter µ, because. x/σ)2. N (x|µ, σ2) ∝ σ−1 exp. (2.240). x = x − µ. As discussed earlier, it is often more convenient to work in terms. where. of the precision λ = 1/σ2 rather than σ itself. Using the transformation rule for. densities, we see that a distribution p(σ) ∝ 1/σ corresponds to a distribution over λ. of the form p(λ) ∝ 1/λ. We have seen that the conjugate prior for λ was the gamma. distribution Gam(λ|a0, b0) given by (2.146). The noninformative prior is obtained. as the special case a0 = b0 = 0. Again, if we examine the results (2.150) and (2.151). for the posterior distribution of λ, we see that for a0 = b0 = 0, the posterior depends. only on terms arising from the data and not from the prior.. "
38,2.5,Nonparametric Methods,"Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on the use of probability distributions. having specific functional forms governed by a small number of parameters whose. values are to be determined from a data set. This is called the parametric approach. to density modelling. An important limitation of this approach is that the chosen. density might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can. result in poor predictive performance. For instance, if the process that generates the. data is multimodal, then this aspect of the distribution can never be captured by a. Gaussian, which is necessarily unimodal.. In this final section, we consider some nonparametric approaches to density es-. timation that make few assumptions about the form of the distribution. Here we shall. focus mainly on simple frequentist methods. The reader should be aware, however,. that nonparametric Bayesian methods are attracting increasing interest (Walker et al.,. 1999; Neal, 2000; M¨uller and Quintana, 2004; Teh et al., 2006).. Let us start with a discussion of histogram methods for density estimation, which. we have already encountered in the context of marginal and conditional distributions. in Figure 1.11 and in the context of the central limit theorem in Figure 2.6. Here we. explore the properties of histogram density models in more detail, focussing on the. case of a single continuous variable x. Standard histograms simply partition x into. distinct bins of width ∆i and then count the number ni of observations of x falling. in bin i. In order to turn this count into a normalized probability density, we simply. divide by the total number N of observations and by the width ∆i of the bins to. obtain probability values for each bin given by. pi = ni. N∆i. (2.241). p(x) dx = 1. This gives a model for the density. for which it is easily seen that. p(x) that is constant over the width of each bin, and often the bins are chosen to have. the same width ∆i = ∆.. Figure 2.24 An illustration of the histogram approach. to density estimation, in which a data set. of 50 data points is generated from the. distribution shown by the green curve.. Histogram density estimates, based on. (2.241), with a common bin width ∆ are. shown for various values of ∆.. 2.5.

Here. the data is drawn from the distribution, corresponding to the green curve, which is. formed from a mixture of two Gaussians. Also shown are three examples of his-. togram density estimates corresponding to three different choices for the bin width. ∆. We see that when ∆ is very small (top figure), the resulting density model is very. spiky, with a lot of structure that is not present in the underlying distribution that. generated the data set. Conversely, if ∆ is too large (bottom figure) then the result is. a model that is too smooth and that consequently fails to capture the bimodal prop-. erty of the green curve. The best results are obtained for some intermediate value. of ∆ (middle figure). In principle, a histogram density model is also dependent on. the choice of edge location for the bins, though this is typically much less significant. than the value of ∆.. Note that the histogram method has the property (unlike the methods to be dis-. cussed shortly) that, once the histogram has been computed, the data set itself can. be discarded, which can be advantageous if the data set is large. Also, the histogram. approach is easily applied if the data points are arriving sequentially.. In practice, the histogram technique can be useful for obtaining a quick visual-. ization of data in one or two dimensions but is unsuited to most density estimation. applications. One obvious problem is that the estimated density has discontinuities. that are due to the bin edges rather than any property of the underlying distribution. that generated the data. Another major limitation of the histogram approach is its. scaling with dimensionality. If we divide each variable in a D-dimensional space. into M bins, then the total number of bins will be M D. This exponential scaling. with D is an example of the curse of dimensionality. In a space of high dimensional-. ity, the quantity of data needed to provide meaningful estimates of local probability. density would be prohibitive.. The histogram approach to density estimation does, however, teach us two im-. portant lessons. First, to estimate the probability density at a particular location,. we should consider the data points that lie within some local neighbourhood of that. point. Note that the concept of locality requires that we assume some form of dis-. tance measure, and here we have been assuming Euclidean distance. For histograms,. Section 1.4. 122. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. this neighbourhood property was defined by the bins, and there is a natural ‘smooth-. ing’ parameter describing the spatial extent of the local region, in this case the bin. width. Second, the value of the smoothing parameter should be neither too large nor. too small in order to obtain good results. This is reminiscent of the choice of model. complexity in polynomial curve fitting discussed in Chapter 1 where the degree M. of the polynomial, or alternatively the value α of the regularization parameter, was. optimal for some intermediate value, neither too large nor too small. Armed with. these insights, we turn now to a discussion of two widely used nonparametric tech-. niques for density estimation, kernel estimators and nearest neighbours, which have. better scaling with dimensionality than the simple histogram model.. "
39,2.5.1,Kernel density estimators,"Let us suppose that observations are being drawn from some unknown probabil-. ity density p(x) in some D-dimensional space, which we shall take to be Euclidean,. and we wish to estimate the value of p(x). From our earlier discussion of locality,. let us consider some small region R containing x. The probability mass associated. with this region is given by. Section 2.1. P =. p(x) dx.. (2.242). R. Now suppose that we have collected a data set comprising N observations drawn. from p(x). Because each data point has a probability P of falling within R, the total. number K of points that lie inside R will be distributed according to the binomial. distribution. (2.243). N!. Bin(K|N, P ) =. K!(N − K)! P K(1 − P )1−K.. Using (2.11), we see that the mean fraction of points falling inside the region is. E[K/N] = P , and similarly using (2.12) we see that the variance around this mean. is var[K/N] = P (1 − P )/N. For large N, this distribution will be sharply peaked. around the mean and so. (2.244). If, however, we also assume that the region R is sufficiently small that the probability. density p(x) is roughly constant over the region, then we have. K  N P.. P  p(x)V. (2.245). where V is the volume of R. Combining (2.244) and (2.245), we obtain our density. estimate in the form. (2.246). p(x) = K. N V. Note that the validity of (2.246) depends on two contradictory assumptions, namely. that the region R be sufficiently small that the density is approximately constant over. the region and yet sufficiently large (in relation to the value of that density) that the. number K of points falling inside the region is sufficient for the binomial distribution. to be sharply peaked.. n=1. N. N. n=1. N. 2.5. Nonparametric Methods. 123. We can exploit the result (2.246) in two different ways. Either we can fix K and. determine the value of V from the data, which gives rise to the K-nearest-neighbour. technique discussed shortly, or we can fix V and determine K from the data, giv-. ing rise to the kernel approach. It can be shown that both the K-nearest-neighbour. density estimator and the kernel density estimator converge to the true probability. density in the limit N → ∞ provided V shrinks suitably with N, and K grows with. N (Duda and Hart, 1973).. We begin by discussing the kernel method in detail, and to start with we take. the region R to be a small hypercube centred on the point x at which we wish to. determine the probability density. In order to count the number K of points falling. within this region, it is convenient to define the following function. k(u) =. |ui| � 1/2,. 1,. 0, otherwise. i = 1, . . . , D,. (2.247). which represents a unit cube centred on the origin. The function k(u) is an example. of a kernel function, and in this context is also called a Parzen window. From (2.247),. the quantity k((x − xn)/h) will be one if the data point xn lies inside a cube of side. h centred on x, and zero otherwise. The total number of data points lying inside this. cube will therefore be. Substituting this expression into (2.246) then gives the following result for the esti-. mated density at x. K =. k. x − xn. h. p(x) =. 1. N. 1. hD k. x − xn. h. (2.248). (2.249). where we have used V = hD for the volume of a hypercube of side h in D di-. mensions. Using the symmetry of the function k(u), we can now re-interpret this. equation, not as a single cube centred on x but as the sum over N cubes centred on. the N data points xn.. As it stands, the kernel density estimator (2.249) will suffer from one of the same. problems that the histogram method suffered from, namely the presence of artificial. discontinuities, in this case at the boundaries of the cubes. We can obtain a smoother. density model if we choose a smoother kernel function, and a common choice is the. Gaussian, which gives rise to the following kernel density model. p(x) =. 1. N. 1. exp. −x − xn2. 2h2. (2.250). (2πh2)1/2. n=1. where h represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian components. Thus our. density model is obtained by placing a Gaussian over each data point and then adding. up the contributions over the whole data set, and then dividing by N so that the den-. sity is correctly normalized. In Figure 2.25, we apply the model (2.250) to the data. 124. 2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. Figure 2.25 Illustration of. the kernel density model. (2.250) applied to the same data set used. to demonstrate the histogram approach in. Figure 2.24. We see that h acts as a. smoothing parameter and that if it is set. too small (top panel), the result is a very. noisy density model, whereas if it is set. too large (bottom panel), then the bimodal. nature of the underlying distribution from. which the data is generated (shown by the. green curve) is washed out. The best den-. sity model is obtained for some intermedi-. ate value of h (middle panel).. h = 0.005. h = 0.07. h = 0.2. 5. 0. 5. 0. 0. 5. 0. 0. 0. 0.5. 0.5. 0.5. 1. 1. 1. set used earlier to demonstrate the histogram technique. We see that, as expected,. the parameter h plays the role of a smoothing parameter, and there is a trade-off. between sensitivity to noise at small h and over-smoothing at large h. Again, the. optimization of h is a problem in model complexity, analogous to the choice of bin. width in histogram density estimation, or the degree of the polynomial used in curve. fitting.. We can choose any other kernel function k(u) in (2.249) subject to the condi-. tions. k(u) � 0,. k(u) du = 1. (2.251). (2.252). which ensure that the resulting probability distribution is nonnegative everywhere. and integrates to one. The class of density model given by (2.249) is called a kernel. density estimator, or Parzen estimator. It has a great merit that there is no compu-. tation involved in the ‘training’ phase because this simply requires storage of the. training set. However, this is also one of its great weaknesses because the computa-. tional cost of evaluating the density grows linearly with the size of the data set.. "
40,2.5.2,Nearest-neighbour methods,"One of the difficulties with the kernel approach to density estimation is that the. parameter h governing the kernel width is fixed for all kernels. In regions of high. data density, a large value of h may lead to over-smoothing and a washing out of. structure that might otherwise be extracted from the data. However, reducing h may. lead to noisy estimates elsewhere in data space where the density is smaller. Thus. the optimal choice for h may be dependent on location within the data space. This. issue is addressed by nearest-neighbour methods for density estimation.. We therefore return to our general result (2.246) for local density estimation,. and instead of fixing V and determining the value of K from the data, we consider. a fixed value of K and use the data to find an appropriate value for V . To do this,. we consider a small sphere centred on the point x at which we wish to estimate the. 2.5. Nonparametric Methods.

The estimate of the density p(x) is then given by (2.246) with V set to. the volume of the resulting sphere. This technique is known as K nearest neighbours. and is illustrated in Figure 2.26, for various choices of the parameter K, using the. same data set as used in Figure 2.24 and Figure 2.25. We see that the value of K. now governs the degree of smoothing and that again there is an optimum choice for. K that is neither too large nor too small. Note that the model produced by K nearest. neighbours is not a true density model because the integral over all space diverges.. We close this chapter by showing how the K-nearest-neighbour technique for. density estimation can be extended to the problem of classification. To do this, we. apply the K-nearest-neighbour density estimation technique to each class separately. and then make use of Bayes’ theorem. Let us suppose that we have a data set com-. k Nk = N. If we. prising Nk points in class Ck with N points in total, so that. wish to classify a new point x, we draw a sphere centred on x containing precisely. K points irrespective of their class. Suppose this sphere has volume V and contains. Kk points from class Ck. Then (2.246) provides an estimate of the density associated. with each class. (2.253). p(x|Ck) = Kk. NkV. Similarly, the unconditional density is given by. p(x) = K. N V. while the class priors are given by. p(Ck) = Nk. N. (2.254). (2.255). We can now combine (2.253), (2.254), and (2.255) using Bayes’ theorem to obtain. the posterior probability of class membership. p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck). p(x). = Kk. K. (2.256). 126. 2.

In the nearest-neighbour. (K = 1) approach to classification,. the resulting decision boundary is. composed of hyperplanes that form. perpendicular bisectors of pairs of. points from different classes.. (b). x1. x1. (a). (b). If we wish to minimize the probability of misclassification, this is done by assigning. the test point x to the class having the largest posterior probability, corresponding to. the largest value of Kk/K. Thus to classify a new point, we identify the K nearest. points from the training data set and then assign the new point to the class having the. largest number of representatives amongst this set. Ties can be broken at random.. The particular case of K = 1 is called the nearest-neighbour rule, because a test. point is simply assigned to the same class as the nearest point from the training set.. These concepts are illustrated in Figure 2.27.. In Figure 2.28, we show the results of applying the K-nearest-neighbour algo-. rithm to the oil flow data, introduced in Chapter 1, for various values of K. As. expected, we see that K controls the degree of smoothing, so that small K produces. many small regions of each class, whereas large K leads to fewer larger regions.. K = 1. x7. 2. 1.

An interesting property of the nearest-neighbour (K = 1) classifier is that, in the. limit N → ∞, the error rate is never more than twice the minimum achievable error. rate of an optimal classifier, i.e., one that uses the true class distributions (Cover and. Hart, 1967) .. As discussed so far, both the K-nearest-neighbour method, and the kernel den-. sity estimator, require the entire training data set to be stored, leading to expensive. computation if the data set is large. This effect can be offset, at the expense of some. additional one-off computation, by constructing tree-based search structures to allow. (approximate) near neighbours to be found efficiently without doing an exhaustive. search of the data set. Nevertheless, these nonparametric methods are still severely. limited. On the other hand, we have seen that simple parametric models are very. restricted in terms of the forms of distribution that they can represent. We therefore. need to find density models that are very flexible and yet for which the complexity. of the models can be controlled independently of the size of the training set, and we. shall see in subsequent chapters how to achieve this..

The focus so far in this book has been on unsupervised learning, including topics. such as density estimation and data clustering. We turn now to a discussion of super-. vised learning, starting with regression. The goal of regression is to predict the value. of one or more continuous target variables t given the value of a D-dimensional vec-. tor x of input variables. We have already encountered an example of a regression. problem when we considered polynomial curve fitting in Chapter 1. The polynomial. is a specific example of a broad class of functions called linear regression models,. which share the property of being linear functions of the adjustable parameters, and. which will form the focus of this chapter. The simplest form of linear regression. models are also linear functions of the input variables. However, we can obtain a. much more useful class of functions by taking linear combinations of a fixed set of. nonlinear functions of the input variables, known as basis functions. Such models. are linear functions of the parameters, which gives them simple analytical properties,. and yet can be nonlinear with respect to the input variables.. 137. 138. "
41,3.,Linear Models for Regression,"Given a training data set comprising N observations {xn}, where n = 1, . . . , N,. together with corresponding target values {tn}, the goal is to predict the value of t. for a new value of x. In the simplest approach, this can be done by directly con-. structing an appropriate function y(x) whose values for new inputs x constitute the. predictions for the corresponding values of t. More generally, from a probabilistic. perspective, we aim to model the predictive distribution p(t|x) because this expresses. our uncertainty about the value of t for each value of x. From this conditional dis-. tribution we can make predictions of t, for any new value of x, in such a way as to. minimize the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. As discussed in Sec-. tion 1.5.5, a common choice of loss function for real-valued variables is the squared. loss, for which the optimal solution is given by the conditional expectation of t.. Although linear models have significant limitations as practical techniques for. pattern recognition, particularly for problems involving input spaces of high dimen-. sionality, they have nice analytical properties and form the foundation for more so-. phisticated models to be discussed in later chapters.. M−1. j=1. "
42,3.1,Linear Basis Function Models,"The simplest linear model for regression is one that involves a linear combination of. the input variables. y(x, w) = w0 + w1x1 + . . . + wDxD. (3.1). where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T. This is often simply known as linear regression. The key. property of this model is that it is a linear function of the parameters w0, . . . , wD. It is. also, however, a linear function of the input variables xi, and this imposes significant. limitations on the model. We therefore extend the class of models by considering. linear combinations of fixed nonlinear functions of the input variables, of the form. y(x, w) = w0 +. wjφj(x). (3.2). where φj(x) are known as basis functions. By denoting the maximum value of the. index j by M − 1, the total number of parameters in this model will be M.. The parameter w0 allows for any fixed offset in the data and is sometimes called. a bias parameter (not to be confused with ‘bias’ in a statistical sense). It is often. convenient to define an additional dummy ‘basis function’ φ0(x) = 1 so that. M−1. y(x, w) =. wjφj(x) = wTφ(x). (3.3). j=0. where w = (w0, . . . , wM−1)T and φ = (φ0, . . . , φM−1)T. In many practical ap-. plications of pattern recognition, we will apply some form of fixed pre-processing,. 3.1. Linear Basis Function Models. 139. or feature extraction, to the original data variables. If the original variables com-. prise the vector x, then the features can be expressed in terms of the basis functions. {φj(x)}.. By using nonlinear basis functions, we allow the function y(x, w) to be a non-. linear function of the input vector x. Functions of the form (3.2) are called linear. models, however, because this function is linear in w. It is this linearity in the pa-. rameters that will greatly simplify the analysis of this class of models. However, it. also leads to some significant limitations, as we discuss in Section 3.6.. The example of polynomial regression considered in Chapter 1 is a particular. example of this model in which there is a single input variable x, and the basis func-. tions take the form of powers of x so that φj(x) = xj. One limitation of polynomial. basis functions is that they are global functions of the input variable, so that changes. in one region of input space affect all other regions. This can be resolved by dividing. the input space up into regions and fit a different polynomial in each region, leading. to spline functions (Hastie et al., 2001).. There are many other possible choices for the basis functions, for example. φj(x) = exp. (x − µj)2. 2s2. (3.4). where the µj govern the locations of the basis functions in input space, and the pa-. rameter s governs their spatial scale. These are usually referred to as ‘Gaussian’. basis functions, although it should be noted that they are not required to have a prob-. abilistic interpretation, and in particular the normalization coefficient is unimportant. because these basis functions will be multiplied by adaptive parameters wj.. Another possibility is the sigmoidal basis function of the form. φj(x) = σ. x − µj. s. where σ(a) is the logistic sigmoid function defined by. σ(a) =. 1. 1 + exp(−a) .. (3.5). (3.6). Equivalently, we can use the ‘tanh’ function because this is related to the logistic. sigmoid by tanh(a) = 2σ(a) − 1, and so a general linear combination of logistic. sigmoid functions is equivalent to a general linear combination of ‘tanh’ functions.. These various choices of basis function are illustrated in Figure 3.1.. Yet another possible choice of basis function is the Fourier basis, which leads to. an expansion in sinusoidal functions. Each basis function represents a specific fre-. quency and has infinite spatial extent. By contrast, basis functions that are localized. to finite regions of input space necessarily comprise a spectrum of different spatial. frequencies. In many signal processing applications, it is of interest to consider ba-. sis functions that are localized in both space and frequency, leading to a class of. functions known as wavelets. These are also defined to be mutually orthogonal, to. simplify their application. Wavelets are most applicable when the input values live. 140. 3.

Useful texts on wavelets include Ogden (1997), Mallat (1999),. and Vidakovic (1999).. Most of the discussion in this chapter, however, is independent of the particular. choice of basis function set, and so for most of our discussion we shall not specify. the particular form of the basis functions, except for the purposes of numerical il-. lustration. Indeed, much of our discussion will be equally applicable to the situation. in which the vector φ(x) of basis functions is simply the identity φ(x) = x. Fur-. thermore, in order to keep the notation simple, we shall focus on the case of a single. target variable t. However, in Section 3.1.5, we consider briefly the modifications. needed to deal with multiple target variables.. "
43,3.1.1,Maximum likelihood and least squares,"In Chapter 1, we fitted polynomial functions to data sets by minimizing a sum-. of-squares error function. We also showed that this error function could be motivated. as the maximum likelihood solution under an assumed Gaussian noise model. Let. us return to this discussion and consider the least squares approach, and its relation. to maximum likelihood, in more detail.. As before, we assume that the target variable t is given by a deterministic func-. tion y(x, w) with additive Gaussian noise so that. t = y(x, w) +. (3.7). where 	 is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with precision (inverse variance). β. Thus we can write. Section 1.5.5. Recall that, if we assume a squared loss function, then the optimal prediction, for a. new value of x, will be given by the conditional mean of the target variable. In the. case of a Gaussian conditional distribution of the form (3.8), the conditional mean. p(t|x, w, β) = N (t|y(x, w), β−1).. (3.8). 1. 2. n=1. n=1. N. N. n=1. N. N. 3.1. Linear Basis Function Models. will be simply. E[t|x] =. tp(t|x) dt = y(x, w).. Note that the Gaussian noise assumption implies that the conditional distribution of. t given x is unimodal, which may be inappropriate for some applications. An ex-. tension to mixtures of conditional Gaussian distributions, which permit multimodal. conditional distributions, will be discussed in Section 14.5.1.. Now consider a data set of inputs X = {x1, . . . , xN} with corresponding target. values t1, . . . , tN . We group the target variables {tn} into a column vector that we. denote by t where the typeface is chosen to distinguish it from a single observation. of a multivariate target, which would be denoted t. Making the assumption that. these data points are drawn independently from the distribution (3.8), we obtain the. following expression for the likelihood function, which is a function of the adjustable. parameters w and β, in the form. p(t|X, w, β) =. N (tn|wTφ(xn), β−1). (3.10). where we have used (3.3). Note that in supervised learning problems such as regres-. sion (and classification), we are not seeking to model the distribution of the input. variables. Thus x will always appear in the set of conditioning variables, and so. from now on we will drop the explicit x from expressions such as p(t|x, w, β) in or-. der to keep the notation uncluttered. Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function,. and making use of the standard form (1.46) for the univariate Gaussian, we have. 141. (3.9). (3.11). (3.12). ln p(t|w, β) =. lnN (tn|wTφ(xn), β−1). = N. 2. ln β −. N. 2. ln(2π) − βED(w). where the sum-of-squares error function is defined by. ED(w) =. {tn − wTφ(xn)}2.. Having written down the likelihood function, we can use maximum likelihood to. determine w and β. Consider first the maximization with respect to w. As observed. already in Section 1.2.5, we see that maximization of the likelihood function under a. conditional Gaussian noise distribution for a linear model is equivalent to minimizing. a sum-of-squares error function given by ED(w). The gradient of the log likelihood. function (3.11) takes the form. ∇ ln p(t|w, β) =. n=1. tn − wTφ(xn). φ(xn)T.. (3.13). n=1. j=1. N. M−1. M−1. wjφj. j=1. φj =. 1. N.

(3.17). is known as the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the matrix Φ (Rao and Mitra,. 1971; Golub and Van Loan, 1996). It can be regarded as a generalization of the. notion of matrix inverse to nonsquare matrices. Indeed, if Φ is square and invertible,. then using the property (AB)−1 = B−1A−1 we see that Φ† ≡ Φ−1.. we make the bias parameter explicit, then the error function (3.12) becomes. At this point, we can gain some insight into the role of the bias parameter w0. If. (3.16). ED(w) =. {tn − w0 −. wjφj(xn)}2.. Setting the derivative with respect to w0 equal to zero, and solving for w0, we obtain. w0 = t −. where we have defined. t =. 1. N. N. tn,. n=1. φj(xn).. n=1. Thus the bias w0 compensates for the difference between the averages (over the. training set) of the target values and the weighted sum of the averages of the basis. function values..

Linear Basis Function Models. 143. Figure 3.2 Geometrical interpretation of the least-squares. solution, in an N-dimensional space whose axes. are the values of t1, . . . , tN . The least-squares. regression function is obtained by finding the or-. thogonal projection of the data vector t onto the. subspace spanned by the basis functions φj(x). in which each basis function is viewed as a vec-. tor ϕj of length N with elements φj(xn).. S. ϕ1. y. ϕ2. t. and so we see that the inverse of the noise precision is given by the residual variance. of the target values around the regression function.. "
44,3.1.2,Geometry of least squares,"At this point, it is instructive to consider the geometrical interpretation of the. least-squares solution. To do this we consider an N-dimensional space whose axes. are given by the tn, so that t = (t1, . . . , tN )T is a vector in this space. Each basis. function φj(xn), evaluated at the N data points, can also be represented as a vector in. the same space, denoted by ϕj, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Note that ϕj corresponds. to the jth column of Φ, whereas φ(xn) corresponds to the nth row of Φ. If the. number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points, then the. M vectors φj(xn) will span a linear subspace S of dimensionality M. We define. y to be an N-dimensional vector whose nth element is given by y(xn, w), where. n = 1, . . . , N. Because y is an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors ϕj, it can. live anywhere in the M-dimensional subspace. The sum-of-squares error (3.12) is. then equal (up to a factor of 1/2) to the squared Euclidean distance between y and. t. Thus the least-squares solution for w corresponds to that choice of y that lies in. subspace S and that is closest to t. Intuitively, from Figure 3.2, we anticipate that. this solution corresponds to the orthogonal projection of t onto the subspace S. This. is indeed the case, as can easily be verified by noting that the solution for y is given. by ΦwML, and then confirming that this takes the form of an orthogonal projection.. In practice, a direct solution of the normal equations can lead to numerical diffi-. culties when ΦTΦ is close to singular. In particular, when two or more of the basis. vectors ϕj are co-linear, or nearly so, the resulting parameter values can have large. magnitudes. Such near degeneracies will not be uncommon when dealing with real. data sets. The resulting numerical difficulties can be addressed using the technique. of singular value decomposition, or SVD (Press et al., 1992; Bishop and Nabney,. 2008). Note that the addition of a regularization term ensures that the matrix is non-. singular, even in the presence of degeneracies.. "
45,3.1.3,Sequential learning,"Batch techniques, such as the maximum likelihood solution (3.15), which in-. volve processing the entire training set in one go, can be computationally costly for. large data sets. As we have discussed in Chapter 1, if the data set is sufficiently large,. it may be worthwhile to use sequential algorithms, also known as on-line algorithms,. Exercise 3.2. 144. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. N. N. n=1. in which the data points are considered one at a time, and the model parameters up-. dated after each such presentation. Sequential learning is also appropriate for real-. time applications in which the data observations are arriving in a continuous stream,. and predictions must be made before all of the data points are seen.. We can obtain a sequential learning algorithm by applying the technique of. stochastic gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent, as follows. If. the error function comprises a sum over data points E =. n En, then after presen-. tation of pattern n, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the parameter. vector w using. (3.22). where τ denotes the iteration number, and η is a learning rate parameter. We shall. discuss the choice of value for η shortly. The value of w is initialized to some starting. vector w(0). For the case of the sum-of-squares error function (3.12), this gives. w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇En. w(τ +1) = w(τ ) + η(tn − w(τ )Tφn)φn. (3.23). where φn = φ(xn). This is known as least-mean-squares or the LMS algorithm.. The value of η needs to be chosen with care to ensure that the algorithm converges. (Bishop and Nabney, 2008).. "
46,3.1.4,Regularized least squares,"In Section 1.1, we introduced the idea of adding a regularization term to an. error function in order to control over-fitting, so that the total error function to be. minimized takes the form. ED(w) + λEW (w). (3.24). where λ is the regularization coefficient that controls the relative importance of the. data-dependent error ED(w) and the regularization term EW (w). One of the sim-. plest forms of regularizer is given by the sum-of-squares of the weight vector ele-. ments. If we also consider the sum-of-squares error function given by. EW (w) =. wTw.. 1. 2. then the total error function becomes. E(w) =. 1. 2. {tn − wTφ(xn)}2. n=1. 1. 2. {tn − wTφ(xn)}2 + λ. 2. wTw.. This particular choice of regularizer is known in the machine learning literature as. weight decay because in sequential learning algorithms, it encourages weight values. to decay towards zero, unless supported by the data. In statistics, it provides an ex-. ample of a parameter shrinkage method because it shrinks parameter values towards. (3.25). (3.26). (3.27). M. N. n=1. M. 3.1. Linear Basis Function Models. 145. q = 0.5. q = 1. q = 2. q = 4. Figure 3.3 Contours of the regularization term in (3.29) for various values of the parameter q.. zero. It has the advantage that the error function remains a quadratic function of. w, and so its exact minimizer can be found in closed form. Specifically, setting the. gradient of (3.27) with respect to w to zero, and solving for w as before, we obtain. w =. λI + ΦTΦ. −1 ΦTt.. (3.28). This represents a simple extension of the least-squares solution (3.15).. A more general regularizer is sometimes used, for which the regularized error. takes the form. 1. 2. {tn − wTφ(xn)}2 + λ. 2. |wj|q. j=1. (3.29). where q = 2 corresponds to the quadratic regularizer (3.27). Figure 3.3 shows con-. tours of the regularization function for different values of q.. The case of q = 1 is know as the lasso in the statistics literature (Tibshirani,. 1996).. It has the property that if λ is sufficiently large, some of the coefficients. wj are driven to zero, leading to a sparse model in which the corresponding basis. functions play no role. To see this, we first note that minimizing (3.29) is equivalent. to minimizing the unregularized sum-of-squares error (3.12) subject to the constraint. |wj|q � η. j=1. (3.30). for an appropriate value of the parameter η, where the two approaches can be related. using Lagrange multipliers. The origin of the sparsity can be seen from Figure 3.4,. which shows that the minimum of the error function, subject to the constraint (3.30).. As λ is increased, so an increasing number of parameters are driven to zero.. Regularization allows complex models to be trained on data sets of limited size. without severe over-fitting, essentially by limiting the effective model complexity.. However, the problem of determining the optimal model complexity is then shifted. from one of finding the appropriate number of basis functions to one of determining. a suitable value of the regularization coefficient λ. We shall return to the issue of. model complexity later in this chapter.. Exercise 3.5. Appendix E. N. N. 146. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. w2.

47,3.1.5,Multiple outputs,"So far, we have considered the case of a single target variable t. In some applica-. tions, we may wish to predict K > 1 target variables, which we denote collectively. by the target vector t. This could be done by introducing a different set of basis func-. tions for each component of t, leading to multiple, independent regression problems.. However, a more interesting, and more common, approach is to use the same set of. basis functions to model all of the components of the target vector so that. y(x, w) = WTφ(x). (3.31). where y is a K-dimensional column vector, W is an M × K matrix of parameters,. and φ(x) is an M-dimensional column vector with elements φj(x), with φ0(x) = 1. as before. Suppose we take the conditional distribution of the target vector to be an. isotropic Gaussian of the form. p(t|x, W, β) = N (t|WTφ(x), β−1I).. (3.32). If we have a set of observations t1, . . . , tN , we can combine these into a matrix T. of size N × K such that the nth row is given by tT. n. Similarly, we can combine the. input vectors x1, . . . , xN into a matrix X. The log likelihood function is then given. by. ln p(T|X, W, β) =. n=1. lnN (tn|WTφ(xn), β−1I). = N K. 2. ln. 2π. 2. tn − WTφ(xn). n=1. 2. . (3.33). 147. (3.34). (3.35). "
48,3.2,The Bias-Variance Decomposition,"As before, we can maximize this function with respect to W, giving. WML =. ΦTΦ. −1 ΦTT.. If we examine this result for each target variable tk, we have. wk =. ΦTΦ. −1 ΦTtk = Φ†tk. Exercise 3.6. where tk is an N-dimensional column vector with components tnk for n = 1, . . . N.. Thus the solution to the regression problem decouples between the different target. variables, and we need only compute a single pseudo-inverse matrix Φ†, which is. shared by all of the vectors wk.. The extension to general Gaussian noise distributions having arbitrary covari-. ance matrices is straightforward. Again, this leads to a decoupling into K inde-. pendent regression problems. This result is unsurprising because the parameters W. define only the mean of the Gaussian noise distribution, and we know from Sec-. tion 2.3.4 that the maximum likelihood solution for the mean of a multivariate Gaus-. sian is independent of the covariance. From now on, we shall therefore consider a. single target variable t for simplicity.. 3.2. The Bias-Variance Decomposition. So far in our discussion of linear models for regression, we have assumed that the. form and number of basis functions are both fixed. As we have seen in Chapter 1,. the use of maximum likelihood, or equivalently least squares, can lead to severe. over-fitting if complex models are trained using data sets of limited size. However,. limiting the number of basis functions in order to avoid over-fitting has the side. effect of limiting the flexibility of the model to capture interesting and important. trends in the data. Although the introduction of regularization terms can control. over-fitting for models with many parameters, this raises the question of how to. determine a suitable value for the regularization coefficient λ. Seeking the solution. that minimizes the regularized error function with respect to both the weight vector. w and the regularization coefficient λ is clearly not the right approach since this. leads to the unregularized solution with λ = 0.. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the phenomenon of over-fitting is really an. unfortunate property of maximum likelihood and does not arise when we marginalize. over parameters in a Bayesian setting. In this chapter, we shall consider the Bayesian. view of model complexity in some depth. Before doing so, however, it is instructive. to consider a frequentist viewpoint of the model complexity issue, known as the bias-. variance trade-off. Although we shall introduce this concept in the context of linear. basis function models, where it is easy to illustrate the ideas using simple examples,. the discussion has more general applicability.. In Section 1.5.5, when we discussed decision theory for regression problems,. we considered various loss functions each of which leads to a corresponding optimal. prediction once we are given the conditional distribution p(t|x). A popular choice is. 148. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. the squared loss function, for which the optimal prediction is given by the conditional. expectation, which we denote by h(x) and which is given by. h(x) = E[t|x] =. tp(t|x) dt.. (3.36). At this point, it is worth distinguishing between the squared loss function arising. from decision theory and the sum-of-squares error function that arose in the maxi-. mum likelihood estimation of model parameters. We might use more sophisticated. techniques than least squares, for example regularization or a fully Bayesian ap-. proach, to determine the conditional distribution p(t|x). These can all be combined. with the squared loss function for the purpose of making predictions.. We showed in Section 1.5.5 that the expected squared loss can be written in the. form. E[L] =. {y(x) − h(x)}2 p(x) dx +. {h(x) − t}2p(x, t) dx dt.. (3.37). Recall that the second term, which is independent of y(x), arises from the intrinsic. noise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss.. The first term depends on our choice for the function y(x), and we will seek a so-. lution for y(x) which makes this term a minimum. Because it is nonnegative, the. smallest that we can hope to make this term is zero. If we had an unlimited supply of. data (and unlimited computational resources), we could in principle find the regres-. sion function h(x) to any desired degree of accuracy, and this would represent the. optimal choice for y(x). However, in practice we have a data set D containing only. a finite number N of data points, and consequently we do not know the regression. function h(x) exactly.. If we model the h(x) using a parametric function y(x, w) governed by a pa-. rameter vector w, then from a Bayesian perspective the uncertainty in our model is. expressed through a posterior distribution over w. A frequentist treatment, however,. involves making a point estimate of w based on the data set D, and tries instead. to interpret the uncertainty of this estimate through the following thought experi-. ment. Suppose we had a large number of data sets each of size N and each drawn. independently from the distribution p(t, x). For any given data set D, we can run. our learning algorithm and obtain a prediction function y(x;D). Different data sets. from the ensemble will give different functions and consequently different values of. the squared loss. The performance of a particular learning algorithm is then assessed. by taking the average over this ensemble of data sets.. Consider the integrand of the first term in (3.37), which for a particular data set. D takes the form. (3.38). Because this quantity will be dependent on the particular data set D, we take its aver-. age over the ensemble of data sets. If we add and subtract the quantity ED[y(x;D)]. {y(x;D) − h(x)}2.. 3.2. The Bias-Variance Decomposition. 149. (3.39). inside the braces, and then expand, we obtain. {y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)] + ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}2. = {y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)]}2 + {ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}2. +2{y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)]}{ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}.. We now take the expectation of this expression with respect to D and note that the. final term will vanish, giving. {y(x;D) − h(x)}2. ED. = {ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}2. (bias)2. variance. + ED. {y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)]}2. (3.40). We see that the expected squared difference between y(x;D) and the regression. function h(x) can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The first term, called the. squared bias, represents the extent to which the average prediction over all data sets. differs from the desired regression function. The second term, called the variance,. measures the extent to which the solutions for individual data sets vary around their. average, and hence this measures the extent to which the function y(x;D) is sensitive. to the particular choice of data set. We shall provide some intuition to support these. definitions shortly when we consider a simple example.. So far, we have considered a single input value x. If we substitute this expansion. back into (3.37), we obtain the following decomposition of the expected squared loss. expected loss = (bias)2 + variance + noise. where. (bias)2 =. variance =. noise =. {ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}2p(x) dx. {y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)]}2. ED. {h(x) − t}2p(x, t) dx dt. (3.41). (3.42). p(x) dx. (3.43). (3.44). and the bias and variance terms now refer to integrated quantities.. Our goal is to minimize the expected loss, which we have decomposed into the. sum of a (squared) bias, a variance, and a constant noise term. As we shall see, there. is a trade-off between bias and variance, with very flexible models having low bias. and high variance, and relatively rigid models having high bias and low variance.. The model with the optimal predictive capability is the one that leads to the best. balance between bias and variance. This is illustrated by considering the sinusoidal. data set from Chapter 1. Here we generate 100 data sets, each containing N = 25. data points, independently from the sinusoidal curve h(x) = sin(2πx). The data. sets are indexed by l = 1, . . . , L, where L = 100, and for each data set D(l) we. Appendix A. 150. 3.

The. top row corresponds to a large value of the regularization coefficient λ that gives low. variance (because the red curves in the left plot look similar) but high bias (because. the two curves in the right plot are very different). Conversely on the bottom row, for. which λ is small, there is large variance (shown by the high variability between the. red curves in the left plot) but low bias (shown by the good fit between the average. model fit and the original sinusoidal function). Note that the result of averaging many. solutions for the complex model with M = 25 is a very good fit to the regression. function, which suggests that averaging may be a beneficial procedure. Indeed, a. weighted averaging of multiple solutions lies at the heart of a Bayesian approach,. although the averaging is with respect to the posterior distribution of parameters, not. with respect to multiple data sets.. We can also examine the bias-variance trade-off quantitatively for this example.. The average prediction is estimated from. y(x) =. y(l)(x). 1.

Conversely, a large value of λ pulls the weight. parameters towards zero leading to large bias.. Although the bias-variance decomposition may provide some interesting in-. sights into the model complexity issue from a frequentist perspective, it is of lim-. ited practical value, because the bias-variance decomposition is based on averages. with respect to ensembles of data sets, whereas in practice we have only the single. observed data set. If we had a large number of independent training sets of a given. size, we would be better off combining them into a single large training set, which. of course would reduce the level of over-fitting for a given model complexity.. Given these limitations, we turn in the next section to a Bayesian treatment of. linear basis function models, which not only provides powerful insights into the. issues of over-fitting but which also leads to practical techniques for addressing the. question model complexity.. "
49,3.3,Bayesian Linear Regression,"In our discussion of maximum likelihood for setting the parameters of a linear re-. gression model, we have seen that the effective model complexity, governed by the. number of basis functions, needs to be controlled according to the size of the data. set. Adding a regularization term to the log likelihood function means the effective. model complexity can then be controlled by the value of the regularization coeffi-. cient, although the choice of the number and form of the basis functions is of course. still important in determining the overall behaviour of the model.. This leaves the issue of deciding the appropriate model complexity for the par-. ticular problem, which cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood func-. tion, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-fitting. In-. dependent hold-out data can be used to determine model complexity, as discussed. in Section 1.3, but this can be both computationally expensive and wasteful of valu-. able data. We therefore turn to a Bayesian treatment of linear regression, which will. avoid the over-fitting problem of maximum likelihood, and which will also lead to. automatic methods of determining model complexity using the training data alone.. Again, for simplicity we will focus on the case of a single target variable t. Ex-. tension to multiple target variables is straightforward and follows the discussion of. Section 3.1.5.. "
50,3.3.1,Parameter distribution,"We begin our discussion of the Bayesian treatment of linear regression by in-. troducing a prior probability distribution over the model parameters w. For the mo-. ment, we shall treat the noise precision parameter β as a known constant. First note. that the likelihood function p(t|w) defined by (3.10) is the exponential of a quadratic. function of w. The corresponding conjugate prior is therefore given by a Gaussian. distribution of the form. having mean m0 and covariance S0.. p(w) = N (w|m0, S0). (3.48). N. n=1. 3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression. 153. Next we compute the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product. of the likelihood function and the prior. Due to the choice of a conjugate Gaus-. sian prior distribution, the posterior will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate this. distribution by the usual procedure of completing the square in the exponential, and. then finding the normalization coefficient using the standard result for a normalized. Gaussian. However, we have already done the necessary work in deriving the gen-. eral result (2.116), which allows us to write down the posterior distribution directly. in the form. where. p(w|t) = N (w|mN , SN ). mN = SN. S−1. N = S−1. 0 + βΦTΦ.. S−1. 0 m0 + βΦTt. Note that because the posterior distribution is Gaussian, its mode coincides with its. mean. Thus the maximum posterior weight vector is simply given by wMAP = mN .. If we consider an infinitely broad prior S0 = α−1I with α → 0, the mean mN. of the posterior distribution reduces to the maximum likelihood value wML given. by (3.15). Similarly, if N = 0, then the posterior distribution reverts to the prior.. Furthermore, if data points arrive sequentially, then the posterior distribution at any. stage acts as the prior distribution for the subsequent data point, such that the new. posterior distribution is again given by (3.49).. For the remainder of this chapter, we shall consider a particular form of Gaus-. sian prior in order to simplify the treatment. Specifically, we consider a zero-mean. isotropic Gaussian governed by a single precision parameter α so that. and the corresponding posterior distribution over w is then given by (3.49) with. p(w|α) = N (w|0, α−1I). mN = βSN ΦTt. S−1. N = αI + βΦTΦ.. (3.49). (3.50). (3.51). (3.52). (3.53). (3.54). Exercise 3.7. Exercise 3.8. The log of the posterior distribution is given by the sum of the log likelihood and. the log of the prior and, as a function of w, takes the form. ln p(w|t) = −. 2. {tn − wTφ(xn)}2 −. 2. wTw + const.. (3.55). Maximization of this posterior distribution with respect to w is therefore equiva-. lent to the minimization of the sum-of-squares error function with the addition of a. quadratic regularization term, corresponding to (3.27) with λ = α/β.. We can illustrate Bayesian learning in a linear basis function model, as well as. the sequential update of a posterior distribution, using a simple example involving. straight-line fitting. Consider a single input variable x, a single target variable t and. 154. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. a linear model of the form y(x, w) = w0 + w1x. Because this has just two adap-. tive parameters, we can plot the prior and posterior distributions directly in parameter. space. We generate synthetic data from the function f(x, a) = a0 + a1x with param-. eter values a0 = −0.3 and a1 = 0.5 by first choosing values of xn from the uniform. distribution U(x|−1, 1), then evaluating f(xn, a), and finally adding Gaussian noise. with standard deviation of 0.2 to obtain the target values tn. Our goal is to recover. the values of a0 and a1 from such data, and we will explore the dependence on the. size of the data set. We assume here that the noise variance is known and hence we. set the precision parameter to its true value β = (1/0.2)2 = 25. Similarly, we fix. the parameter α to 2.0. We shall shortly discuss strategies for determining α and. β from the training data. Figure 3.7 shows the results of Bayesian learning in this. model as the size of the data set is increased and demonstrates the sequential nature. of Bayesian learning in which the current posterior distribution forms the prior when. a new data point is observed. It is worth taking time to study this figure in detail as. it illustrates several important aspects of Bayesian inference. The first row of this. figure corresponds to the situation before any data points are observed and shows a. plot of the prior distribution in w space together with six samples of the function. y(x, w) in which the values of w are drawn from the prior. In the second row, we. see the situation after observing a single data point. The location (x, t) of the data. point is shown by a blue circle in the right-hand column. In the left-hand column is a. plot of the likelihood function p(t|x, w) for this data point as a function of w. Note. that the likelihood function provides a soft constraint that the line must pass close to. the data point, where close is determined by the noise precision β. For comparison,. the true parameter values a0 = −0.3 and a1 = 0.5 used to generate the data set. are shown by a white cross in the plots in the left column of Figure 3.7. When we. multiply this likelihood function by the prior from the top row, and normalize, we. obtain the posterior distribution shown in the middle plot on the second row. Sam-. ples of the regression function y(x, w) obtained by drawing samples of w from this. posterior distribution are shown in the right-hand plot. Note that these sample lines. all pass close to the data point. The third row of this figure shows the effect of ob-. serving a second data point, again shown by a blue circle in the plot in the right-hand. column. The corresponding likelihood function for this second data point alone is. shown in the left plot. When we multiply this likelihood function by the posterior. distribution from the second row, we obtain the posterior distribution shown in the. middle plot of the third row. Note that this is exactly the same posterior distribution. as would be obtained by combining the original prior with the likelihood function. for the two data points. This posterior has now been influenced by two data points,. and because two points are sufficient to define a line this already gives a relatively. compact posterior distribution. Samples from this posterior distribution give rise to. the functions shown in red in the third column, and we see that these functions pass. close to both of the data points. The fourth row shows the effect of observing a total. of 20 data points. The left-hand plot shows the likelihood function for the 20th data. point alone, and the middle plot shows the resulting posterior distribution that has. now absorbed information from all 20 observations. Note how the posterior is much. sharper than in the third row. In the limit of an infinite number of data points, the. 3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression. 155.

(3.56). in which q = 2 corresponds to the Gaussian distribution, and only in this case is the. prior conjugate to the likelihood function (3.10). Finding the maximum of the poste-. rior distribution over w corresponds to minimization of the regularized error function. (3.29). In the case of the Gaussian prior, the mode of the posterior distribution was. equal to the mean, although this will no longer hold if q = 2.. "
51,3.3.2,Predictive distribution,"In practice, we are not usually interested in the value of w itself but rather in. making predictions of t for new values of x. This requires that we evaluate the. predictive distribution defined by. p(t|t, α, β) =. p(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β) dw. (3.57). in which t is the vector of target values from the training set, and we have omitted the. corresponding input vectors from the right-hand side of the conditioning statements. to simplify the notation. The conditional distribution p(t|x, w, β) of the target vari-. able is given by (3.8), and the posterior weight distribution is given by (3.49). We. see that (3.57) involves the convolution of two Gaussian distributions, and so making. use of the result (2.115) from Section 8.1.4, we see that the predictive distribution. takes the form. where the variance σ2. p(t|x, t, α, β) = N (t|mT. N (x) of the predictive distribution is given by. N φ(x), σ2. N (x)). (3.58). (3.59). N (x) =. σ2. 1. + φ(x)TSN φ(x).. The first term in (3.59) represents the noise on the data whereas the second term. reflects the uncertainty associated with the parameters w. Because the noise process. and the distribution of w are independent Gaussians, their variances are additive.. Note that, as additional data points are observed, the posterior distribution becomes. N +1(x) �. narrower. As a consequence it can be shown (Qazaz et al., 1997) that σ2. N (x). In the limit N → ∞, the second term in (3.59) goes to zero, and the variance. σ2. of the predictive distribution arises solely from the additive noise governed by the. parameter β..

See the text for a detailed discussion.. we fit a model comprising a linear combination of Gaussian basis functions to data. sets of various sizes and then look at the corresponding posterior distributions. Here. the green curves correspond to the function sin(2πx) from which the data points. were generated (with the addition of Gaussian noise). Data sets of size N = 1,. N = 2, N = 4, and N = 25 are shown in the four plots by the blue circles. For. each plot, the red curve shows the mean of the corresponding Gaussian predictive. distribution, and the red shaded region spans one standard deviation either side of. the mean. Note that the predictive uncertainty depends on x and is smallest in the. neighbourhood of the data points. Also note that the level of uncertainty decreases. as more data points are observed.. The plots in Figure 3.8 only show the point-wise predictive variance as a func-. tion of x. In order to gain insight into the covariance between the predictions at. different values of x, we can draw samples from the posterior distribution over w,. and then plot the corresponding functions y(x, w), as shown in Figure 3.9.. 158. 3.

Figure 3.9 Plots of the function y(x, w) using samples from the posterior distributions over w corresponding to. the plots in Figure 3.8.. If we used localized basis functions such as Gaussians, then in regions away. from the basis function centres, the contribution from the second term in the predic-. tive variance (3.59) will go to zero, leaving only the noise contribution β−1. Thus,. the model becomes very confident in its predictions when extrapolating outside the. region occupied by the basis functions, which is generally an undesirable behaviour.. This problem can be avoided by adopting an alternative Bayesian approach to re-. gression known as a Gaussian process.. Note that, if both w and β are treated as unknown, then we can introduce a. conjugate prior distribution p(w, β) that, from the discussion in Section 2.3.6, will. be given by a Gaussian-gamma distribution (Denison et al., 2002). In this case, the. predictive distribution is a Student’s t-distribution.. Section 6.4. Exercise 3.12. Exercise 3.13. 3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression. 159.

52,3.3.3,Equivalent kernel,"The posterior mean solution (3.53) for the linear basis function model has an in-. teresting interpretation that will set the stage for kernel methods, including Gaussian. processes. If we substitute (3.53) into the expression (3.3), we see that the predictive. mean can be written in the form. Chapter 6. y(x, mN ) = mT. N φ(x) = βφ(x)TSN ΦTt =. βφ(x)TSN φ(xn)tn. (3.60). n=1. where SN is defined by (3.51). Thus the mean of the predictive distribution at a point. x is given by a linear combination of the training set target variables tn, so that we. can write. where the function. y(x, mN ) =. k(x, xn)tn. n=1. k(x, x) = βφ(x)TSN φ(x). (3.61). (3.62). is known as the smoother matrix or the equivalent kernel. Regression functions, such. as this, which make predictions by taking linear combinations of the training set. target values are known as linear smoothers. Note that the equivalent kernel depends. on the input values xn from the data set because these appear in the definition of. SN . The equivalent kernel is illustrated for the case of Gaussian basis functions in. Figure 3.10 in which the kernel functions k(x, x) have been plotted as a function of. x for three different values of x. We see that they are localized around x, and so the. mean of the predictive distribution at x, given by y(x, mN ), is obtained by forming. a weighted combination of the target values in which data points close to x are given. higher weight than points further removed from x. Intuitively, it seems reasonable. that we should weight local evidence more strongly than distant evidence. Note that. this localization property holds not only for the localized Gaussian basis functions. but also for the nonlocal polynomial and sigmoidal basis functions, as illustrated in. Figure 3.11.. 160. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. Figure 3.11 Examples of equiva-. lent kernels k(x, x) for x = 0. plotted as a function of x, corre-. sponding (left) to the polynomial ba-. sis functions and (right) to the sig-. moidal basis functions shown in Fig-. ure 3.1.

Further insight into the role of the equivalent kernel can be obtained by consid-. ering the covariance between y(x) and y(x), which is given by. cov[y(x), y(x)] = cov[φ(x)Tw, wTφ(x)]. = φ(x)TSN φ(x) = β−1k(x, x). (3.63). where we have made use of (3.49) and (3.62). From the form of the equivalent. kernel, we see that the predictive mean at nearby points will be highly correlated,. whereas for more distant pairs of points the correlation will be smaller.. The predictive distribution shown in Figure 3.8 allows us to visualize the point-. wise uncertainty in the predictions, governed by (3.59). However, by drawing sam-. ples from the posterior distribution over w, and plotting the corresponding model. functions y(x, w) as in Figure 3.9, we are visualizing the joint uncertainty in the. posterior distribution between the y values at two (or more) x values, as governed by. the equivalent kernel.. The formulation of linear regression in terms of a kernel function suggests an. alternative approach to regression as follows. Instead of introducing a set of basis. functions, which implicitly determines an equivalent kernel, we can instead define. a localized kernel directly and use this to make predictions for new input vectors x,. given the observed training set. This leads to a practical framework for regression. (and classification) called Gaussian processes, which will be discussed in detail in. Section 6.4.. We have seen that the effective kernel defines the weights by which the training. set target values are combined in order to make a prediction at a new value of x, and. it can be shown that these weights sum to one, in other words. k(x, xn) = 1. n=1.

This intuitively pleasing result can easily be proven informally. y(x). by noting that the summation is equivalent to considering the predictive mean. for a set of target data in which tn = 1 for all n. Provided the basis functions are. linearly independent, that there are more data points than basis functions, and that. one of the basis functions is constant (corresponding to the bias parameter), then it is. clear that we can fit the training data exactly and hence that the predictive mean will.

Note that the kernel function can. be simply. be negative as well as positive, so although it satisfies a summation constraint, the. corresponding predictions are not necessarily convex combinations of the training. set target variables.. Chapter 6. Finally, we note that the equivalent kernel (3.62) satisfies an important property. shared by kernel functions in general, namely that it can be expressed in the form an. inner product with respect to a vector ψ(x) of nonlinear functions, so that. k(x, z) = ψ(x)Tψ(z). (3.65). where ψ(x) = β1/2S1/2. N φ(x).. 3.4. Bayesian Model Comparison. In Chapter 1, we highlighted the problem of over-fitting as well as the use of cross-. validation as a technique for setting the values of regularization parameters or for. choosing between alternative models. Here we consider the problem of model se-. lection from a Bayesian perspective.. In this section, our discussion will be very. general, and then in Section 3.5 we shall see how these ideas can be applied to the. determination of regularization parameters in linear regression.. As we shall see, the over-fitting associated with maximum likelihood can be. avoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters in-. stead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared di-. rectly on the training data, without the need for a validation set. This allows all. available data to be used for training and avoids the multiple training runs for each. model associated with cross-validation. It also allows multiple complexity parame-. ters to be determined simultaneously as part of the training process. For example,. in Chapter 7 we shall introduce the relevance vector machine, which is a Bayesian. model having one complexity parameter for every training data point.. The Bayesian view of model comparison simply involves the use of probabilities. to represent uncertainty in the choice of model, along with a consistent application. of the sum and product rules of probability. Suppose we wish to compare a set of L. models {Mi} where i = 1, . . . , L. Here a model refers to a probability distribution. over the observed data D. In the case of the polynomial curve-fitting problem, the. distribution is defined over the set of target values t, while the set of input values X. is assumed to be known. Other types of model define a joint distributions over X. and t. We shall suppose that the data is generated from one of these models but we. are uncertain which one. Our uncertainty is expressed through a prior probability. distribution p(Mi). Given a training set D, we then wish to evaluate the posterior. distribution. (3.66). The prior allows us to express a preference for different models. Let us simply. assume that all models are given equal prior probability. The interesting term is. the model evidence p(D|Mi) which expresses the preference shown by the data for. p(Mi|D) ∝ p(Mi)p(D|Mi).. Section 1.5.4. i=1. L. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. different models, and we shall examine this term in more detail shortly. The model. evidence is sometimes also called the marginal likelihood because it can be viewed. as a likelihood function over the space of models, in which the parameters have been. marginalized out. The ratio of model evidences p(D|Mi)/p(D|Mj) for two models. is known as a Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995).. Once we know the posterior distribution over models, the predictive distribution. is given, from the sum and product rules, by. p(t|x,D) =. p(t|x,Mi,D)p(Mi|D).. (3.67). This is an example of a mixture distribution in which the overall predictive distribu-. tion is obtained by averaging the predictive distributions p(t|x,Mi,D) of individual. models, weighted by the posterior probabilities p(Mi|D) of those models. For in-. stance, if we have two models that are a-posteriori equally likely and one predicts. a narrow distribution around t = a while the other predicts a narrow distribution. around t = b, the overall predictive distribution will be a bimodal distribution with. modes at t = a and t = b, not a single model at t = (a + b)/2.. A simple approximation to model averaging is to use the single most probable. model alone to make predictions. This is known as model selection.. For a model governed by a set of parameters w, the model evidence is given,. from the sum and product rules of probability, by. p(D|Mi) =. p(D|w,Mi)p(w|Mi) dw.. (3.68). From a sampling perspective, the marginal likelihood can be viewed as the proba-. bility of generating the data set D from a model whose parameters are sampled at. random from the prior. It is also interesting to note that the evidence is precisely the. normalizing term that appears in the denominator in Bayes’ theorem when evaluating. the posterior distribution over parameters because. p(w|D,Mi) = p(D|w,Mi)p(w|Mi). p(D|Mi). (3.69). We can obtain some insight into the model evidence by making a simple approx-. imation to the integral over parameters. Consider first the case of a model having a. single parameter w. The posterior distribution over parameters is proportional to. p(D|w)p(w), where we omit the dependence on the model Mi to keep the notation. uncluttered. If we assume that the posterior distribution is sharply peaked around the. most probable value wMAP, with width ∆wposterior, then we can approximate the in-. tegral by the value of the integrand at its maximum times the width of the peak. If we. further assume that the prior is flat with width ∆wprior so that p(w) = 1/∆wprior,. then we have. p(D) =. p(D|w)p(w) dw  p(D|wMAP). ∆wposterior. ∆wprior. (3.70). 162. Chapter 11. 3.4. Bayesian Model Comparison. ∆wposterior. 163. w. (3.71). Figure 3.12 We can obtain a rough approximation to. the model evidence if we assume that. the posterior distribution over parame-. ters is sharply peaked around its mode. wMAP.. and so taking logs we obtain. ln p(D)  ln p(D|wMAP) + ln. wMAP. ∆wprior. ∆wposterior. ∆wprior. This approximation is illustrated in Figure 3.12. The first term represents the fit to. the data given by the most probable parameter values, and for a flat prior this would. correspond to the log likelihood. The second term penalizes the model according to. its complexity. Because ∆wposterior < ∆wprior this term is negative, and it increases. in magnitude as the ratio ∆wposterior/∆wprior gets smaller. Thus, if parameters are. finely tuned to the data in the posterior distribution, then the penalty term is large.. For a model having a set of M parameters, we can make a similar approximation. for each parameter in turn. Assuming that all parameters have the same ratio of. ∆wposterior/∆wprior, we obtain. ln p(D)  ln p(D|wMAP) + M ln. ∆wposterior. ∆wprior. (3.72). Thus, in this very simple approximation, the size of the complexity penalty increases. linearly with the number M of adaptive parameters in the model. As we increase. the complexity of the model, the first term will typically decrease, because a more. complex model is better able to fit the data, whereas the second term will increase. due to the dependence on M. The optimal model complexity, as determined by. the maximum evidence, will be given by a trade-off between these two competing. terms. We shall later develop a more refined version of this approximation, based on. a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution.. We can gain further insight into Bayesian model comparison and understand. how the marginal likelihood can favour models of intermediate complexity by con-. sidering Figure 3.13. Here the horizontal axis is a one-dimensional representation. of the space of possible data sets, so that each point on this axis corresponds to a. specific data set. We now consider three models M1, M2 and M3 of successively. increasing complexity. Imagine running these models generatively to produce exam-. ple data sets, and then looking at the distribution of data sets that result. Any given. Section 4.4.1. 164. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION.

Note that the dis-. tributions are normalized.. In. this example,. for the partic-. ular observed data set D0,. the model M2 with intermedi-. ate complexity has the largest. evidence.. Bayes factor in the form. p(D). M1. M2. D0. M3. D. model can generate a variety of different data sets since the parameters are governed. by a prior probability distribution, and for any choice of the parameters there may. be random noise on the target variables. To generate a particular data set from a spe-. cific model, we first choose the values of the parameters from their prior distribution. p(w), and then for these parameter values we sample the data from p(D|w). A sim-. ple model (for example, based on a first order polynomial) has little variability and. so will generate data sets that are fairly similar to each other. Its distribution p(D). is therefore confined to a relatively small region of the horizontal axis. By contrast,. a complex model (such as a ninth order polynomial) can generate a great variety of. different data sets, and so its distribution p(D) is spread over a large region of the. space of data sets. Because the distributions p(D|Mi) are normalized, we see that. the particular data set D0 can have the highest value of the evidence for the model. of intermediate complexity. Essentially, the simpler model cannot fit the data well,. whereas the more complex model spreads its predictive probability over too broad a. range of data sets and so assigns relatively small probability to any one of them.. Implicit in the Bayesian model comparison framework is the assumption that. the true distribution from which the data are generated is contained within the set of. models under consideration. Provided this is so, we can show that Bayesian model. comparison will on average favour the correct model. To see this, consider two. models M1 and M2 in which the truth corresponds to M1. For a given finite data. set, it is possible for the Bayes factor to be larger for the incorrect model. However, if. we average the Bayes factor over the distribution of data sets, we obtain the expected. Section 1.6.1. p(D|M1) ln p(D|M1). p(D|M2). dD. (3.73). where the average has been taken with respect to the true distribution of the data.. This quantity is an example of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and satisfies the prop-. erty of always being positive unless the two distributions are equal in which case it. is zero. Thus on average the Bayes factor will always favour the correct model.. We have seen that the Bayesian framework avoids the problem of over-fitting. and allows models to be compared on the basis of the training data alone. However,. "
54,3.5,The Evidence Approximation,"165. a Bayesian approach, like any approach to pattern recognition, needs to make as-. sumptions about the form of the model, and if these are invalid then the results can. be misleading. In particular, we see from Figure 3.12 that the model evidence can. be sensitive to many aspects of the prior, such as the behaviour in the tails. Indeed,. the evidence is not defined if the prior is improper, as can be seen by noting that. an improper prior has an arbitrary scaling factor (in other words, the normalization. coefficient is not defined because the distribution cannot be normalized). If we con-. sider a proper prior and then take a suitable limit in order to obtain an improper prior. (for example, a Gaussian prior in which we take the limit of infinite variance) then. the evidence will go to zero, as can be seen from (3.70) and Figure 3.12. It may,. however, be possible to consider the evidence ratio between two models first and. then take a limit to obtain a meaningful answer.. In a practical application, therefore, it will be wise to keep aside an independent. test set of data on which to evaluate the overall performance of the final system.. 3.5. The Evidence Approximation. In a fully Bayesian treatment of the linear basis function model, we would intro-. duce prior distributions over the hyperparameters α and β and make predictions by. marginalizing with respect to these hyperparameters as well as with respect to the. parameters w. However, although we can integrate analytically over either w or. over the hyperparameters, the complete marginalization over all of these variables. is analytically intractable. Here we discuss an approximation in which we set the. hyperparameters to specific values determined by maximizing the marginal likeli-. hood function obtained by first integrating over the parameters w. This framework. is known in the statistics literature as empirical Bayes (Bernardo and Smith, 1994;. Gelman et al., 2004), or type 2 maximum likelihood (Berger, 1985), or generalized. maximum likelihood (Wahba, 1975), and in the machine learning literature is also. called the evidence approximation (Gull, 1989; MacKay, 1992a).. If we introduce hyperpriors over α and β, the predictive distribution is obtained. by marginalizing over w, α and β so that. p(t|t) =. p(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β)p(α, β|t) dw dα dβ. (3.74). where p(t|w, β) is given by (3.8) and p(w|t, α, β) is given by (3.49) with mN and. SN defined by (3.53) and (3.54) respectively. Here we have omitted the dependence. on the input variable x to keep the notation uncluttered. If the posterior distribution. p(α, β|t) is sharply peaked around values. β, then the predictive distribution is. obtained simply by marginalizing over w in which α and β are fixed to the values. and. β, so that. α and. p(t|t)  p(t|t,. p(t|w,. β)p(w|t,. β) dw.. (3.75). 166. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. From Bayes’ theorem, the posterior distribution for α and β is given by. p(α, β|t) ∝ p(t|α, β)p(α, β).. (3.76). α and. If the prior is relatively flat, then in the evidence framework the values of. β are obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood function p(t|α, β). We shall. proceed by evaluating the marginal likelihood for the linear basis function model and. then finding its maxima. This will allow us to determine values for these hyperpa-. rameters from the training data alone, without recourse to cross-validation. Recall. that the ratio α/β is analogous to a regularization parameter.. As an aside it is worth noting that, if we define conjugate (Gamma) prior distri-. butions over α and β, then the marginalization over these hyperparameters in (3.74). can be performed analytically to give a Student’s t-distribution over w (see Sec-. tion 2.3.7). Although the resulting integral over w is no longer analytically tractable,. it might be thought that approximating this integral, for example using the Laplace. approximation discussed (Section 4.4) which is based on a local Gaussian approxi-. mation centred on the mode of the posterior distribution, might provide a practical. alternative to the evidence framework (Buntine and Weigend, 1991). However, the. integrand as a function of w typically has a strongly skewed mode so that the Laplace. approximation fails to capture the bulk of the probability mass, leading to poorer re-. sults than those obtained by maximizing the evidence (MacKay, 1999).. Returning to the evidence framework, we note that there are two approaches that. we can take to the maximization of the log evidence. We can evaluate the evidence. function analytically and then set its derivative equal to zero to obtain re-estimation. equations for α and β, which we shall do in Section 3.5.2. Alternatively we use a. technique called the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which will be dis-. cussed in Section 9.3.4 where we shall also show that these two approaches converge. to the same solution.. "
55,3.5.1,Evaluation of the evidence function,"The marginal likelihood function p(t|α, β) is obtained by integrating over the. weight parameters w, so that. p(t|α, β) =. p(t|w, β)p(w|α) dw.. (3.77). Exercise 3.16. Exercise 3.17. One way to evaluate this integral is to make use once again of the result (2.115). for the conditional distribution in a linear-Gaussian model. Here we shall evaluate. the integral instead by completing the square in the exponent and making use of the. standard form for the normalization coefficient of a Gaussian.. From (3.11), (3.12), and (3.52), we can write the evidence function in the form. p(t|α, β) =. 2π. N/2. M/2. 2π. exp{−E(w)} dw. (3.78). 1. 2. 167. (3.79). (3.80). (3.81). (3.82). (3.83). (3.84).

We recognize (3.79) as being equal, up to a constant of proportionality, to the reg-. ularized sum-of-squares error function (3.27). We now complete the square over w. giving. E(w) = E(mN ) +. (w − mN )TA(w − mN ). A = αI + βΦTΦ. where we have introduced. together with. E(mN ) = β. 2 t − ΦmN2 + α. 2. mT. N mN .. Note that A corresponds to the matrix of second derivatives of the error function. and is known as the Hessian matrix. Here we have also defined mN given by. A = ∇∇E(w). mN = βA−1ΦTt.. Using (3.54), we see that A = S−1. definition (3.53), and therefore represents the mean of the posterior distribution.. N , and hence (3.84) is equivalent to the previous. The integral over w can now be evaluated simply by appealing to the standard. result for the normalization coefficient of a multivariate Gaussian, giving. exp{−E(w)} dw. = exp{−E(mN )}. = exp{−E(mN )}(2π)M/2|A|−1/2.. exp. 1. 2.

(3.86). which is the required expression for the evidence function.. Returning to the polynomial regression problem, we can plot the model evidence. against the order of the polynomial, as shown in Figure 3.14. Here we have assumed. a prior of the form (1.65) with the parameter α fixed at α = 5 × 10−3. The form. of this plot is very instructive. Referring back to Figure 1.4, we see that the M = 0. polynomial has very poor fit to the data and consequently gives a relatively low value. 168. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION.

However, in going to M = 2, the data. fit is improved only very marginally, due to the fact that the underlying sinusoidal. function from which the data is generated is an odd function and so has no even terms. in a polynomial expansion. Indeed, Figure 1.5 shows that the residual data error is. reduced only slightly in going from M = 1 to M = 2. Because this richer model. suffers a greater complexity penalty, the evidence actually falls in going from M = 1. to M = 2. When we go to M = 3 we obtain a significant further improvement in. data fit, as seen in Figure 1.4, and so the evidence is increased again, giving the. highest overall evidence for any of the polynomials. Further increases in the value. of M produce only small improvements in the fit to the data but suffer increasing. complexity penalty, leading overall to a decrease in the evidence values. Looking. again at Figure 1.5, we see that the generalization error is roughly constant between. M = 3 and M = 8, and it would be difficult to choose between these models on. the basis of this plot alone. The evidence values, however, show a clear preference. for M = 3, since this is the simplest model which gives a good explanation for the. observed data.. "
56,3.5.2,Maximizing the evidence function,"Let us first consider the maximization of p(t|α, β) with respect to α. This can. be done by first defining the following eigenvector equation. (3.87). From (3.81), it then follows that A has eigenvalues α + λi. Now consider the deriva-. tive of the term involving ln|A| in (3.86) with respect to α. We have. ui = λiui.. βΦTΦ. d. dα. ln|A| = d. dα. ln. i. (λi + α) = d. dα. ln(λi + α) =. 1. λi + α. i. Thus the stationary points of (3.86) with respect to α satisfy. 0 = M. 2α −. 1. 2. mT.

Multiplying through by 2α and rearranging, we obtain. αmT. N mN = M − α. 1. λi + α. i. Since there are M terms in the sum over i, the quantity γ can be written. Exercise 3.20. The interpretation of the quantity γ will be discussed shortly. From (3.90) we see. that the value of α that maximizes the marginal likelihood satisfies. λi. α + λi. mT. N mN. Note that this is an implicit solution for α not only because γ depends on α, but also. because the mode mN of the posterior distribution itself depends on the choice of. α. We therefore adopt an iterative procedure in which we make an initial choice for. α and use this to find mN , which is given by (3.53), and also to evaluate γ, which. is given by (3.91). These values are then used to re-estimate α using (3.92), and the. process repeated until convergence. Note that because the matrix ΦTΦ is fixed, we. can compute its eigenvalues once at the start and then simply multiply these by β to. obtain the λi.. It should be emphasized that the value of α has been determined purely by look-. ing at the training data. In contrast to maximum likelihood methods, no independent. data set is required in order to optimize the model complexity.. We can similarly maximize the log marginal likelihood (3.86) with respect to β.. To do this, we note that the eigenvalues λi defined by (3.87) are proportional to β,. and hence dλi/dβ = λi/β giving. d. dβ. ln|A| = d. dβ. ln(λi + α) =. 1. λi. λi + α. (3.93). The stationary point of the marginal likelihood therefore satisfies. Exercise 3.22. and rearranging we obtain. 0 = N. 2β −. tn − mT. N φ(xn). 2. 2β. 1. N − γ. n=1. tn − mT. N φ(xn). 2. Again, this is an implicit solution for β and can be solved by choosing an initial. value for β and then using this to calculate mN and γ and then re-estimate β using. (3.95), repeating until convergence. If both α and β are to be determined from the. data, then their values can be re-estimated together after each update of γ.. 170. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION.

For α = 0, the mode of the poste-. rior is given by the maximum likelihood solution wML,. whereas for nonzero α the mode is at wMAP = mN . In. the direction w1 the eigenvalue λ1, defined by (3.87), is. small compared with α and so the quantity λ1/(λ1 + α). is close to zero, and the corresponding MAP value of. w1 is also close to zero. By contrast, in the direction w2. the eigenvalue λ2 is large compared with α and so the. quantity λ2/(λ2 +α) is close to unity, and the MAP value. of w2 is close to its maximum likelihood value.. w2. u2. wML. wMAP. u1. w1. "
57,3.5.3,Effective number of parameters,"The result (3.92) has an elegant interpretation (MacKay, 1992a), which provides. insight into the Bayesian solution for α. To see this, consider the contours of the like-. lihood function and the prior as illustrated in Figure 3.15. Here we have implicitly. transformed to a rotated set of axes in parameter space aligned with the eigenvec-. tors ui defined in (3.87). Contours of the likelihood function are then axis-aligned. ellipses. The eigenvalues λi measure the curvature of the likelihood function, and. so in Figure 3.15 the eigenvalue λ1 is small compared with λ2 (because a smaller. curvature corresponds to a greater elongation of the contours of the likelihood func-. tion). Because βΦTΦ is a positive definite matrix, it will have positive eigenvalues,. and so the ratio λi/(λi + α) will lie between 0 and 1. Consequently, the quantity γ. defined by (3.91) will lie in the range 0 � γ � M. For directions in which λi. the corresponding parameter wi will be close to its maximum likelihood value, and. the ratio λi/(λi + α) will be close to 1. Such parameters are called well determined. because their values are tightly constrained by the data. Conversely, for directions. in which λi  α, the corresponding parameters wi will be close to zero, as will the. ratios λi/(λi + α). These are directions in which the likelihood function is relatively. insensitive to the parameter value and so the parameter has been set to a small value. by the prior. The quantity γ defined by (3.91) therefore measures the effective total. number of well determined parameters.. We can obtain some insight into the result (3.95) for re-estimating β by com-. paring it with the corresponding maximum likelihood result given by (3.21). Both. of these formulae express the variance (the inverse precision) as an average of the. squared differences between the targets and the model predictions. However, they. differ in that the number of data points N in the denominator of the maximum like-. lihood result is replaced by N − γ in the Bayesian result. We recall from (1.56) that. the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for a Gaussian distribution over a. n=1. N. 3.5. The Evidence Approximation. single variable x is given by. ML =. σ2. 1. N. (xn − µML)2. and that this estimate is biased because the maximum likelihood solution µML for. the mean has fitted some of the noise on the data. In effect, this has used up one. degree of freedom in the model. The corresponding unbiased estimate is given by. (1.59) and takes the form. 171. (3.96). MAP =. σ2. (xn − µML)2.. (3.97). N. 1. N − 1. n=1. We shall see in Section 10.1.3 that this result can be obtained from a Bayesian treat-. ment in which we marginalize over the unknown mean. The factor of N − 1 in the. denominator of the Bayesian result takes account of the fact that one degree of free-. dom has been used in fitting the mean and removes the bias of maximum likelihood.. Now consider the corresponding results for the linear regression model. The mean. of the target distribution is now given by the function wTφ(x), which contains M. parameters. However, not all of these parameters are tuned to the data. The effective. number of parameters that are determined by the data is γ, with the remaining M −γ. parameters set to small values by the prior. This is reflected in the Bayesian result. for the variance that has a factor N − γ in the denominator, thereby correcting for. the bias of the maximum likelihood result.. We can illustrate the evidence framework for setting hyperparameters using the. sinusoidal synthetic data set from Section 1.1, together with the Gaussian basis func-. tion model comprising 9 basis functions, so that the total number of parameters in. the model is given by M = 10 including the bias. Here, for simplicity of illustra-. tion, we have set β to its true value of 11.1 and then used the evidence framework to. determine α, as shown in Figure 3.16.. We can also see how the parameter α controls the magnitude of the parameters. {wi}, by plotting the individual parameters versus the effective number γ of param-. eters, as shown in Figure 3.17.. If we consider the limit N. M in which the number of data points is large in. relation to the number of parameters, then from (3.87) all of the parameters will be. well determined by the data because ΦTΦ involves an implicit sum over data points,. and so the eigenvalues λi increase with the size of the data set. In this case, γ = M,. and the re-estimation equations for α and β become. M. 2EW (mN ). N. 2ED(mN ). (3.98). (3.99). where EW and ED are defined by (3.25) and (3.26), respectively. These results. can be used as an easy-to-compute approximation to the full evidence re-estimation. 172. 3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION. −5. 0. ln α. 5. −5. 0. ln α. 5.

58,3.6,Limitations of Fixed Basis Functions,"Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on models comprising a linear combina-. tion of fixed, nonlinear basis functions. We have seen that the assumption of linearity. in the parameters led to a range of useful properties including closed-form solutions. to the least-squares problem, as well as a tractable Bayesian treatment. Furthermore,. for a suitable choice of basis functions, we can model arbitrary nonlinearities in the. j=1. M. M. Exercises. 173. mapping from input variables to targets. In the next chapter, we shall study an anal-. ogous class of models for classification.. It might appear, therefore, that such linear models constitute a general purpose. framework for solving problems in pattern recognition. Unfortunately, there are. some significant shortcomings with linear models, which will cause us to turn in. later chapters to more complex models such as support vector machines and neural. networks.. The difficulty stems from the assumption that the basis functions φj(x) are fixed. before the training data set is observed and is a manifestation of the curse of dimen-. sionality discussed in Section 1.4. As a consequence, the number of basis functions. needs to grow rapidly, often exponentially, with the dimensionality D of the input. space.. Fortunately, there are two properties of real data sets that we can exploit to help. alleviate this problem. First of all, the data vectors {xn} typically lie close to a non-. linear manifold whose intrinsic dimensionality is smaller than that of the input space. as a result of strong correlations between the input variables. We will see an example. of this when we consider images of handwritten digits in Chapter 12. If we are using. localized basis functions, we can arrange that they are scattered in input space only. in regions containing data. This approach is used in radial basis function networks. and also in support vector and relevance vector machines. Neural network models,. which use adaptive basis functions having sigmoidal nonlinearities, can adapt the. parameters so that the regions of input space over which the basis functions vary. corresponds to the data manifold. The second property is that target variables may. have significant dependence on only a small number of possible directions within the. data manifold. Neural networks can exploit this property by choosing the directions. in input space to which the basis functions respond..

In the previous chapter, we explored a class of regression models having particularly. simple analytical and computational properties. We now discuss an analogous class. of models for solving classification problems. The goal in classification is to take an. input vector x and to assign it to one of K discrete classes Ck where k = 1, . . . , K.. In the most common scenario, the classes are taken to be disjoint, so that each input is. assigned to one and only one class. The input space is thereby divided into decision. regions whose boundaries are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. In. this chapter, we consider linear models for classification, by which we mean that the. decision surfaces are linear functions of the input vector x and hence are defined. by (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes within the D-dimensional input space. Data. sets whose classes can be separated exactly by linear decision surfaces are said to be. linearly separable.. For regression problems, the target variable t was simply the vector of real num-. bers whose values we wish to predict. In the case of classification, there are various. 179. 180. "
59,4.,Linear Models for Classification,"ways of using target values to represent class labels. For probabilistic models, the. most convenient, in the case of two-class problems, is the binary representation in. which there is a single target variable t ∈ {0, 1} such that t = 1 represents class C1. and t = 0 represents class C2. We can interpret the value of t as the probability that. the class is C1, with the values of probability taking only the extreme values of 0 and. 1. For K > 2 classes, it is convenient to use a 1-of-K coding scheme in which t is. a vector of length K such that if the class is Cj, then all elements tk of t are zero. except element tj, which takes the value 1. For instance, if we have K = 5 classes,. then a pattern from class 2 would be given the target vector. t = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T.. (4.1). Again, we can interpret the value of tk as the probability that the class is Ck. For. nonprobabilistic models, alternative choices of target variable representation will. sometimes prove convenient.. In Chapter 1, we identified three distinct approaches to the classification prob-. lem. The simplest involves constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns. each vector x to a specific class. A more powerful approach, however, models the. conditional probability distribution p(Ck|x) in an inference stage, and then subse-. quently uses this distribution to make optimal decisions. By separating inference. and decision, we gain numerous benefits, as discussed in Section 1.5.4. There are. two different approaches to determining the conditional probabilities p(Ck|x). One. technique is to model them directly, for example by representing them as parametric. models and then optimizing the parameters using a training set. Alternatively, we. can adopt a generative approach in which we model the class-conditional densities. given by p(x|Ck), together with the prior probabilities p(Ck) for the classes, and then. we compute the required posterior probabilities using Bayes’ theorem. p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck). p(x). (4.2). We shall discuss examples of all three approaches in this chapter.. In the linear regression models considered in Chapter 3, the model prediction. y(x, w) was given by a linear function of the parameters w. In the simplest case,. the model is also linear in the input variables and therefore takes the form y(x) =. wTx + w0, so that y is a real number. For classification problems, however, we wish. to predict discrete class labels, or more generally posterior probabilities that lie in. the range (0, 1). To achieve this, we consider a generalization of this model in which. we transform the linear function of w using a nonlinear function f(· ) so that. y(x) = f. wTx + w0. (4.3). In the machine learning literature f(· ) is known as an activation function, whereas. its inverse is called a link function in the statistics literature. The decision surfaces. correspond to y(x) = constant, so that wTx + w0 = constant and hence the deci-. sion surfaces are linear functions of x, even if the function f(·) is nonlinear. For this. reason, the class of models described by (4.3) are called generalized linear models. "
60,4.1,Discriminant Functions,"181. (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). Note, however, that in contrast to the models used. for regression, they are no longer linear in the parameters due to the presence of the. nonlinear function f(·). This will lead to more complex analytical and computa-. tional properties than for linear regression models. Nevertheless, these models are. still relatively simple compared to the more general nonlinear models that will be. studied in subsequent chapters.. The algorithms discussed in this chapter will be equally applicable if we first. make a fixed nonlinear transformation of the input variables using a vector of basis. functions φ(x) as we did for regression models in Chapter 3. We begin by consider-. ing classification directly in the original input space x, while in Section 4.3 we shall. find it convenient to switch to a notation involving basis functions for consistency. with later chapters.. 4.1. Discriminant Functions. A discriminant is a function that takes an input vector x and assigns it to one of K. classes, denoted Ck. In this chapter, we shall restrict attention to linear discriminants,. namely those for which the decision surfaces are hyperplanes. To simplify the dis-. cussion, we consider first the case of two classes and then investigate the extension. to K > 2 classes.. "
61,4.1.1,Two classes,"The simplest representation of a linear discriminant function is obtained by tak-. ing a linear function of the input vector so that. y(x) = wTx + w0. (4.4). where w is called a weight vector, and w0 is a bias (not to be confused with bias in. the statistical sense). The negative of the bias is sometimes called a threshold. An. input vector x is assigned to class C1 if y(x) � 0 and to class C2 otherwise. The cor-. responding decision boundary is therefore defined by the relation y(x) = 0, which. corresponds to a (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplane within the D-dimensional input. space. Consider two points xA and xB both of which lie on the decision surface.. Because y(xA) = y(xB) = 0, we have wT(xA − xB) = 0 and hence the vector w is. orthogonal to every vector lying within the decision surface, and so w determines the. orientation of the decision surface. Similarly, if x is a point on the decision surface,. then y(x) = 0, and so the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is. given by. We therefore see that the bias parameter w0 determines the location of the decision. surface. These properties are illustrated for the case of D = 2 in Figure 4.1.. Furthermore, we note that the value of y(x) gives a signed measure of the per-. pendicular distance r of the point x from the decision surface. To see this, consider. wTx. w. (4.5). w0. w. 182. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. Figure 4.1 Illustration of the geometry of a. linear discriminant function in two dimensions.. The decision surface, shown in red, is perpen-. dicular to w, and its displacement from the. origin is controlled by the bias parameter w0.. Also, the signed orthogonal distance of a gen-. eral point x from the decision surface is given. by y(x)/w.. y > 0. y = 0. y < 0. x2. R1.

Multiplying both sides of this result by wT and adding w0, and making use of y(x) =. wTx + w0 and y(x⊥) = wTx⊥ + w0 = 0, we have. x = x⊥ + r. This result is illustrated in Figure 4.1.. As with the linear regression models in Chapter 3, it is sometimes convenient. to use a more compact notation in which we introduce an additional dummy ‘input’. value x0 = 1 and then define. x = (x0, x) so that. w = (w0, w) and. In this case, the decision surfaces are D-dimensional hyperplanes passing through. the origin of the D + 1-dimensional expanded input space.. "
62,4.1.2,Multiple classes,"Now consider the extension of linear discriminants to K > 2 classes. We might. be tempted be to build a K-class discriminant by combining a number of two-class. discriminant functions. However, this leads to some serious difficulties (Duda and. Hart, 1973) as we now show.. Consider the use of K−1 classifiers each of which solves a two-class problem of. separating points in a particular class Ck from points not in that class. This is known. as a one-versus-the-rest classifier. The left-hand example in Figure 4.2 shows an. 4.1. Discriminant Functions. 183. C1. R1. C3. R3. R2. C3. C2. C1. C2. R1. not C1. R3. not C2. R2. C2.

On the left is an example involving the use of two discriminants designed to. distinguish points in class Ck from points not in class Ck. On the right is an example involving three discriminant. functions each of which is used to separate a pair of classes Ck and Cj.. example involving three classes where this approach leads to regions of input space. that are ambiguously classified.. An alternative is to introduce K(K − 1)/2 binary discriminant functions, one. for every possible pair of classes. This is known as a one-versus-one classifier. Each. point is then classified according to a majority vote amongst the discriminant func-. tions. However, this too runs into the problem of ambiguous regions, as illustrated. in the right-hand diagram of Figure 4.2.. We can avoid these difficulties by considering a single K-class discriminant. comprising K linear functions of the form. yk(x) = wT. (4.9). and then assigning a point x to class Ck if yk(x) > yj(x) for all j = k. The decision. boundary between class Ck and class Cj is therefore given by yk(x) = yj(x) and. hence corresponds to a (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplane defined by. k x + wk0. (wk − wj)Tx + (wk0 − wj0) = 0.. (4.10). This has the same form as the decision boundary for the two-class case discussed in. Section 4.1.1, and so analogous geometrical properties apply.. The decision regions of such a discriminant are always singly connected and. convex. To see this, consider two points xA and xB both of which lie inside decision. x that lies on the line connecting. region Rk, as illustrated in Figure 4.3. Any point. xA and xB can be expressed in the form. x = λxA + (1 − λ)xB. (4.11). b. 184. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. Figure 4.3 Illustration of the decision regions for a mul-. ticlass linear discriminant, with the decision. boundaries shown in red.. If two points xA. and xB both lie inside the same decision re-. gion Rk, then any point. x that lies on the line. connecting these two points must also lie in. Rk, and hence the decision region must be. singly connected and convex.. Ri. xA. Rj. Rk. ˆx. xB. where 0 � λ � 1. From the linearity of the discriminant functions, it follows that. yk(. x) = λyk(xA) + (1 − λ)yk(xB).. (4.12). Because both xA and xB lie inside Rk, it follows that yk(xA) > yj(xA), and. yk(xB) > yj(xB), for all j = k, and hence yk(. x also lies. inside Rk. Thus Rk is singly connected and convex.. Note that for two classes, we can either employ the formalism discussed here,. based on two discriminant functions y1(x) and y2(x), or else use the simpler but. equivalent formulation described in Section 4.1.1 based on a single discriminant. function y(x).. x), and so. x) > yj(. We now explore three approaches to learning the parameters of linear discrimi-. nant functions, based on least squares, Fisher’s linear discriminant, and the percep-. tron algorithm.. "
63,4.1.3,Least squares for classification,"In Chapter 3, we considered models that were linear functions of the parame-. ters, and we saw that the minimization of a sum-of-squares error function led to a. simple closed-form solution for the parameter values. It is therefore tempting to see. if we can apply the same formalism to classification problems. Consider a general. classification problem with K classes, with a 1-of-K binary coding scheme for the. target vector t. One justification for using least squares in such a context is that it. approximates the conditional expectation E[t|x] of the target values given the input. vector. For the binary coding scheme, this conditional expectation is given by the. vector of posterior class probabilities. Unfortunately, however, these probabilities. are typically approximated rather poorly, indeed the approximations can have values. outside the range (0, 1), due to the limited flexibility of a linear model as we shall. see shortly.. Each class Ck is described by its own linear model so that. where k = 1, . . . , K. We can conveniently group these together using vector nota-. tion so that. yk(x) = wT. k x + wk0. y(x) =. WT. x.

Section 2.3.7. An interesting property of least-squares solutions with multiple target variables. is that if every target vector in the training set satisfies some linear constraint. aTtn + b = 0. (4.18). for some constants a and b, then the model prediction for any value of x will satisfy. the same constraint so that. aTy(x) + b = 0.. (4.19). Thus if we use a 1-of-K coding scheme for K classes, then the predictions made. by the model will have the property that the elements of y(x) will sum to 1 for any. value of x. However, this summation constraint alone is not sufficient to allow the. model outputs to be interpreted as probabilities because they are not constrained to. lie within the interval (0, 1).. The least-squares approach gives an exact closed-form solution for the discrimi-. nant function parameters. However, even as a discriminant function (where we use it. to make decisions directly and dispense with any probabilistic interpretation) it suf-. fers from some severe problems. We have already seen that least-squares solutions. lack robustness to outliers, and this applies equally to the classification application,. as illustrated in Figure 4.4. Here we see that the additional data points in the right-. hand figure produce a significant change in the location of the decision boundary,. even though these point would be correctly classified by the original decision bound-. ary in the left-hand figure. The sum-of-squares error function penalizes predictions. that are ‘too correct’ in that they lie a long way on the correct side of the decision. 186. 4.

The right-hand plot shows the corresponding results obtained. when extra data points are added at the bottom left of the diagram, showing that least squares is highly sensitive. to outliers, unlike logistic regression.. boundary. In Section 7.1.2, we shall consider several alternative error functions for. classification and we shall see that they do not suffer from this difficulty.. However, problems with least squares can be more severe than simply lack of. robustness, as illustrated in Figure 4.5. This shows a synthetic data set drawn from. three classes in a two-dimensional input space (x1, x2), having the property that lin-. ear decision boundaries can give excellent separation between the classes. Indeed,. the technique of logistic regression, described later in this chapter, gives a satisfac-. tory solution as seen in the right-hand plot. However, the least-squares solution gives. poor results, with only a small region of the input space assigned to the green class.. The failure of least squares should not surprise us when we recall that it cor-. responds to maximum likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian conditional. distribution, whereas binary target vectors clearly have a distribution that is far from. Gaussian. By adopting more appropriate probabilistic models, we shall obtain clas-. sification techniques with much better properties than least squares. For the moment,. however, we continue to explore alternative nonprobabilistic methods for setting the. parameters in the linear classification models.. "

(4.20). If we place a threshold on y and classify y � −w0 as class C1, and otherwise class. C2, then we obtain our standard linear classifier discussed in the previous section.. In general, the projection onto one dimension leads to a considerable loss of infor-. mation, and classes that are well separated in the original D-dimensional space may. become strongly overlapping in one dimension. However, by adjusting the com-. ponents of the weight vector w, we can select a projection that maximizes the class. separation. To begin with, consider a two-class problem in which there are N1 points. of class C1 and N2 points of class C2, so that the mean vectors of the two classes are. given by. (4.21). m1 =. xn.. xn,. m2 =. 1. N1. n ∈ C1. 1. N2. n ∈ C2. The simplest measure of the separation of the classes, when projected onto w, is the. separation of the projected class means.

Using. problem, we could constrain w to have unit length, so that. a Lagrange multiplier to perform the constrained maximization, we then find that. w ∝ (m2 − m1). There is still a problem with this approach, however, as illustrated. in Figure 4.6. This shows two classes that are well separated in the original two-. dimensional space (x1, x2) but that have considerable overlap when projected onto. the line joining their means. This difficulty arises from the strongly nondiagonal. covariances of the class distributions. The idea proposed by Fisher is to maximize. a function that will give a large separation between the projected class means while. also giving a small variance within each class, thereby minimizing the class overlap.. The projection formula (4.20) transforms the set of labelled data points in x. into a labelled set in the one-dimensional space y. The within-class variance of the. transformed data from class Ck is therefore given by. (yn − mk)2. k =. s2. (4.24). where yn = wTxn. We can define the total within-class variance for the whole. 2.

J(w) =. wTSBw. wTSWw. 189. (4.26). (4.27). where SB is the between-class covariance matrix and is given by. SB = (m2 − m1)(m2 − m1)T. and SW is the total within-class covariance matrix, given by. SW =. n∈C1. (xn − m1)(xn − m1)T +. n∈C2. (xn − m2)(xn − m2)T.. (4.28). Differentiating (4.26) with respect to w, we find that J(w) is maximized when. (wTSBw)SWw = (wTSWw)SBw.. (4.29). From (4.27), we see that SBw is always in the direction of (m2−m1). Furthermore,. we do not care about the magnitude of w, only its direction, and so we can drop the. scalar factors (wTSBw) and (wTSWw). Multiplying both sides of (4.29) by S−1. W. we then obtain. (4.30). Note that if the within-class covariance is isotropic, so that SW is proportional to the. unit matrix, we find that w is proportional to the difference of the class means, as. discussed above.. W (m2 − m1).. w ∝ S−1. The result (4.30) is known as Fisher’s linear discriminant, although strictly it. is not a discriminant but rather a specific choice of direction for projection of the. data down to one dimension. However, the projected data can subsequently be used. to construct a discriminant, by choosing a threshold y0 so that we classify a new. point as belonging to C1 if y(x) � y0 and classify it as belonging to C2 otherwise.. For example, we can model the class-conditional densities p(y|Ck) using Gaussian. distributions and then use the techniques of Section 1.2.4 to find the parameters. of the Gaussian distributions by maximum likelihood. Having found Gaussian ap-. proximations to the projected classes, the formalism of Section 1.5.1 then gives an. expression for the optimal threshold. Some justification for the Gaussian assumption. comes from the central limit theorem by noting that y = wTx is the sum of a set of. random variables.. "
65,4.1.5,Relation to least squares,"The least-squares approach to the determination of a linear discriminant was. based on the goal of making the model predictions as close as possible to a set of. target values. By contrast, the Fisher criterion was derived by requiring maximum. class separation in the output space. It is interesting to see the relationship between. these two approaches. In particular, we shall show that, for the two-class problem,. the Fisher criterion can be obtained as a special case of least squares.. So far we have considered 1-of-K coding for the target values. If, however, we. adopt a slightly different target coding scheme, then the least-squares solution for. E =. 1. 2. n=1. n=1. N. n=1. n=1. N. N. N. 190. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. the weights becomes equivalent to the Fisher solution (Duda and Hart, 1973). In. particular, we shall take the targets for class C1 to be N/N1, where N1 is the number. of patterns in class C1, and N is the total number of patterns. This target value. approximates the reciprocal of the prior probability for class C1. For class C2, we. shall take the targets to be −N/N2, where N2 is the number of patterns in class C2.. The sum-of-squares error function can be written. wTxn + w0 − tn. 2. (4.31). Setting the derivatives of E with respect to w0 and w to zero, we obtain respectively. wTxn + w0 − tn. = 0. wTxn + w0 − tn. xn = 0.. (4.32). (4.33). From (4.32), and making use of our choice of target coding scheme for the tn, we. obtain an expression for the bias in the form. where we have used. w0 = −wTm. tn = N1. N. N1 − N2. (4.34). (4.35). N. N2. = 0. and where m is the mean of the total data set and is given by. m =. 1. N. N. xn =. n=1. 1. N. (N1m1 + N2m2).. (4.36). Exercise 4.6. After some straightforward algebra, and again making use of the choice of tn, the. second equation (4.33) becomes. SW + N1N2. N. SB. w = N(m1 − m2). (4.37). where SW is defined by (4.28), SB is defined by (4.27), and we have substituted for. the bias using (4.34). Using (4.27), we note that SBw is always in the direction of. (m2 − m1). Thus we can write. w ∝ S−1. W (m2 − m1). (4.38). where we have ignored irrelevant scale factors. Thus the weight vector coincides. with that found from the Fisher criterion. In addition, we have also found an expres-. sion for the bias value w0 given by (4.34). This tells us that a new vector x should be. classified as belonging to class C1 if y(x) = wT(x−m) > 0 and class C2 otherwise.. K. k=1. n∈Ck. 1. Nk. 1. N. n=1. n=1. N. N. K. K. 4.1.

66,4.1.6,Fisher’s discriminant for multiple classes,"We now consider the generalization of the Fisher discriminant to K > 2 classes,. and we shall assume that the dimensionality D of the input space is greater than the. number K of classes. Next, we introduce D > 1 linear ‘features’ yk = wT. k x, where. k = 1, . . . , D. These feature values can conveniently be grouped together to form. a vector y. Similarly, the weight vectors {wk} can be considered to be the columns. of a matrix W, so that. (4.39). Note that again we are not including any bias parameters in the definition of y. The. generalization of the within-class covariance matrix to the case of K classes follows. from (4.28) to give. y = WTx.. SW =. Sk. where. (xn − mk)(xn − mk)T. Sk =. mk =. xn. n∈Ck. and Nk is the number of patterns in class Ck. In order to find a generalization of the. between-class covariance matrix, we follow Duda and Hart (1973) and consider first. the total covariance matrix. where m is the mean of the total data set. ST =. (xn − m)(xn − m)T. m =. xn =. 1. N. Nkmk. k=1. and N =. k Nk is the total number of data points. The total covariance matrix can. be decomposed into the sum of the within-class covariance matrix, given by (4.40). and (4.41), plus an additional matrix SB, which we identify as a measure of the. between-class covariance. ST = SW + SB. where. SB =. k=1. Nk(mk − m)(mk − m)T.. (4.40). (4.41). (4.42). (4.43). (4.44). (4.45). (4.46). n∈Ck. k=1. k=1. K. K. n∈Ck. K. k=1. 192. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. These covariance matrices have been defined in the original x-space. We can now. define similar matrices in the projected D-dimensional y-space. and. where. sW =. (yn − µk)(yn − µk)T. sB =. Nk(µk − µ)(µk − µ)T. µk =. 1. Nk. yn,. 1. N. Nkµk.. (4.47). (4.48). (4.49). Again we wish to construct a scalar that is large when the between-class covariance. is large and when the within-class covariance is small. There are now many possible. choices of criterion (Fukunaga, 1990). One example is given by. J(W) = Tr. s−1. W sB. (4.50). This criterion can then be rewritten as an explicit function of the projection matrix. W in the form. J(w) = Tr. (WSWWT)−1(WSBWT). (4.51). Maximization of such criteria is straightforward, though somewhat involved, and is. discussed at length in Fukunaga (1990). The weight values are determined by those. eigenvectors of S−1. W SB that correspond to the D largest eigenvalues.. There is one important result that is common to all such criteria, which is worth. emphasizing. We first note from (4.46) that SB is composed of the sum of K ma-. trices, each of which is an outer product of two vectors and therefore of rank 1. In. addition, only (K − 1) of these matrices are independent as a result of the constraint. (4.44). Thus, SB has rank at most equal to (K − 1) and so there are at most (K − 1). nonzero eigenvalues. This shows that the projection onto the (K − 1)-dimensional. subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of SB does not alter the value of J(w), and. so we are therefore unable to find more than (K − 1) linear ‘features’ by this means. (Fukunaga, 1990).. "
67,4.1.7,The perceptron algorithm,"Another example of a linear discriminant model is the perceptron of Rosenblatt. (1962), which occupies an important place in the history of pattern recognition al-. gorithms. It corresponds to a two-class model in which the input vector x is first. transformed using a fixed nonlinear transformation to give a feature vector φ(x),. and this is then used to construct a generalized linear model of the form. y(x) = f. wTφ(x). (4.52). 4.1. Discriminant Functions. 193. where the nonlinear activation function f(·) is given by a step function of the form. (4.53). f(a) =. +1, a � 0. −1, a < 0.. The vector φ(x) will typically include a bias component φ0(x) = 1.. In earlier. discussions of two-class classification problems, we have focussed on a target coding. scheme in which t ∈ {0, 1}, which is appropriate in the context of probabilistic. models. For the perceptron, however, it is more convenient to use target values. t = +1 for class C1 and t = −1 for class C2, which matches the choice of activation. function.. The algorithm used to determine the parameters w of the perceptron can most. easily be motivated by error function minimization. A natural choice of error func-. tion would be the total number of misclassified patterns. However, this does not lead. to a simple learning algorithm because the error is a piecewise constant function. of w, with discontinuities wherever a change in w causes the decision boundary to. move across one of the data points. Methods based on changing w using the gradi-. ent of the error function cannot then be applied, because the gradient is zero almost. everywhere.. We therefore consider an alternative error function known as the perceptron cri-. terion. To derive this, we note that we are seeking a weight vector w such that. patterns xn in class C1 will have wTφ(xn) > 0, whereas patterns xn in class C2. have wTφ(xn) < 0. Using the t ∈ {−1, +1} target coding scheme it follows that. we would like all patterns to satisfy wTφ(xn)tn > 0. The perceptron criterion. associates zero error with any pattern that is correctly classified, whereas for a mis-. classified pattern xn it tries to minimize the quantity −wTφ(xn)tn. The perceptron. criterion is therefore given by. EP(w) = −. n∈M. wTφntn. (4.54). Frank Rosenblatt. 1928–1969. Rosenblatt’s perceptron played an. important role in the history of ma-. chine learning.. Initially, Rosenblatt. simulated the perceptron on an IBM. 704 computer at Cornell. in 1957,. but by the early 1960s he had built. special-purpose hardware that provided a direct, par-. allel implementation of perceptron learning. Many of. his ideas were encapsulated in “Principles of Neuro-. dynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mech-. anisms” published in 1962. Rosenblatt’s work was. criticized by Marvin Minksy, whose objections were. published in the book “Perceptrons”, co-authored with. Seymour Papert. This book was widely misinter-. preted at the time as showing that neural networks. were fatally flawed and could only learn solutions for. linearly separable problems.. In fact, it only proved. such limitations in the case of single-layer networks. such as the perceptron and merely conjectured (in-. correctly) that they applied to more general network. models. Unfortunately, however, this book contributed. to the substantial decline in research funding for neu-. ral computing, a situation that was not reversed un-. til the mid-1980s. Today, there are many hundreds,. if not thousands, of applications of neural networks. in widespread use, with examples in areas such as. handwriting recognition and information retrieval be-. ing used routinely by millions of people.. 194. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. Section 3.1.3. where M denotes the set of all misclassified patterns. The contribution to the error. associated with a particular misclassified pattern is a linear function of w in regions. of w space where the pattern is misclassified and zero in regions where it is correctly. classified. The total error function is therefore piecewise linear.. We now apply the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this error function.. The change in the weight vector w is then given by. w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇EP(w) = w(τ ) + ηφntn. (4.55). where η is the learning rate parameter and τ is an integer that indexes the steps of. the algorithm. Because the perceptron function y(x, w) is unchanged if we multiply. w by a constant, we can set the learning rate parameter η equal to 1 without of. generality. Note that, as the weight vector evolves during training, the set of patterns. that are misclassified will change.. The perceptron learning algorithm has a simple interpretation, as follows. We. cycle through the training patterns in turn, and for each pattern xn we evaluate the. perceptron function (4.52).. If the pattern is correctly classified, then the weight. vector remains unchanged, whereas if it is incorrectly classified, then for class C1. we add the vector φ(xn) onto the current estimate of weight vector w while for. class C2 we subtract the vector φ(xn) from w. The perceptron learning algorithm is. illustrated in Figure 4.7.. If we consider the effect of a single update in the perceptron learning algorithm,. we see that the contribution to the error from a misclassified pattern will be reduced. because from (4.55) we have. −w(τ +1)Tφntn = −w(τ )Tφntn − (φntn)Tφntn < −w(τ )Tφntn. (4.56). where we have set η = 1, and made use of φntn2 > 0. Of course, this does. not imply that the contribution to the error function from the other misclassified. patterns will have been reduced. Furthermore, the change in weight vector may have. caused some previously correctly classified patterns to become misclassified. Thus. the perceptron learning rule is not guaranteed to reduce the total error function at. each stage.. However, the perceptron convergence theorem states that if there exists an ex-. act solution (in other words, if the training data set is linearly separable), then the. perceptron learning algorithm is guaranteed to find an exact solution in a finite num-. ber of steps. Proofs of this theorem can be found for example in Rosenblatt (1962),. Block (1962), Nilsson (1965), Minsky and Papert (1969), Hertz et al. (1991), and. Bishop (1995a). Note, however, that the number of steps required to achieve con-. vergence could still be substantial, and in practice, until convergence is achieved,. we will not be able to distinguish between a nonseparable problem and one that is. simply slow to converge.. Even when the data set is linearly separable, there may be many solutions, and. which one is found will depend on the initialization of the parameters and on the or-. der of presentation of the data points. Furthermore, for data sets that are not linearly. separable, the perceptron learning algorithm will never converge.. 4.1.

The data point circled. in green is misclassified and so its feature vector is added to the current weight vector, giving the new decision. boundary shown in the top right plot. The bottom left plot shows the next misclassified point to be considered,. indicated by the green circle, and its feature vector is again added to the weight vector giving the decision. boundary shown in the bottom right plot for which all data points are correctly classified.. 196. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. Figure 4.8 Illustration of the Mark 1 perceptron hardware. The photograph on the left shows how the inputs. were obtained using a simple camera system in which an input scene, in this case a printed character, was. illuminated by powerful lights, and an image focussed onto a 20 × 20 array of cadmium sulphide photocells,. giving a primitive 400 pixel image. The perceptron also had a patch board, shown in the middle photograph,. which allowed different configurations of input features to be tried. Often these were wired up at random to. demonstrate the ability of the perceptron to learn without the need for precise wiring, in contrast to a modern. digital computer. The photograph on the right shows one of the racks of adaptive weights. Each weight was. implemented using a rotary variable resistor, also called a potentiometer, driven by an electric motor thereby. allowing the value of the weight to be adjusted automatically by the learning algorithm.. Aside from difficulties with the learning algorithm, the perceptron does not pro-. vide probabilistic outputs, nor does it generalize readily to K > 2 classes. The most. important limitation, however, arises from the fact that (in common with all of the. models discussed in this chapter and the previous one) it is based on linear com-. binations of fixed basis functions. More detailed discussions of the limitations of. perceptrons can be found in Minsky and Papert (1969) and Bishop (1995a).. Analogue hardware implementations of the perceptron were built by Rosenblatt,. based on motor-driven variable resistors to implement the adaptive parameters wj.. These are illustrated in Figure 4.8. The inputs were obtained from a simple camera. system based on an array of photo-sensors, while the basis functions φ could be. chosen in a variety of ways, for example based on simple fixed functions of randomly. chosen subsets of pixels from the input image. Typical applications involved learning. to discriminate simple shapes or characters.. At the same time that the perceptron was being developed, a closely related. system called the adaline, which is short for ‘adaptive linear element’, was being. explored by Widrow and co-workers. The functional form of the model was the same. as for the perceptron, but a different approach to training was adopted (Widrow and. Hoff, 1960; Widrow and Lehr, 1990).. "
68,4.2,Probabilistic Generative Models,"We turn next to a probabilistic view of classification and show how models with. linear decision boundaries arise from simple assumptions about the distribution of. the data. In Section 1.5.4, we discussed the distinction between the discriminative. and the generative approaches to classification. Here we shall adopt a generative. 4.2. Probabilistic Generative Models. 197. Figure 4.9 Plot of the logistic sigmoid function. σ(a) defined by (4.59), shown in. red, together with the scaled pro-. bit function Φ(λa), for λ2 = π/8,. shown in dashed blue, where Φ(a). is defined by (4.114). The scal-. ing factor π/8 is chosen so that the. derivatives of the two curves are. equal for a = 0.. 1. 0.5. 0. −5. 0. 5. approach in which we model the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck), as well as the. class priors p(Ck), and then use these to compute posterior probabilities p(Ck|x). through Bayes’ theorem.. Consider first of all the case of two classes. The posterior probability for class. C1 can be written as. p(C1|x) =. p(x|C1)p(C1). p(x|C1)p(C1) + p(x|C2)p(C2). 1 + exp(−a). = σ(a). 1. where we have defined. a = ln p(x|C1)p(C1). p(x|C2)p(C2). and σ(a) is the logistic sigmoid function defined by. σ(a) =. 1. 1 + exp(−a). which is plotted in Figure 4.9. The term ‘sigmoid’ means S-shaped. This type of. function is sometimes also called a ‘squashing function’ because it maps the whole. real axis into a finite interval. The logistic sigmoid has been encountered already. in earlier chapters and plays an important role in many classification algorithms. It. satisfies the following symmetry property. as is easily verified. The inverse of the logistic sigmoid is given by. σ(−a) = 1 − σ(a). a = ln. 1 − σ. and is known as the logit function. It represents the log of the ratio of probabilities. ln [p(C1|x)/p(C2|x)] for the two classes, also known as the log odds.. (4.57). (4.58). (4.59). (4.60). (4.61). 198. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. Note that in (4.57) we have simply rewritten the posterior probabilities in an. equivalent form, and so the appearance of the logistic sigmoid may seem rather vac-. uous. However, it will have significance provided a(x) takes a simple functional. form. We shall shortly consider situations in which a(x) is a linear function of x, in. which case the posterior probability is governed by a generalized linear model.. For the case of K > 2 classes, we have. p(Ck|x) =. p(x|Ck)p(Ck). j p(x|Cj)p(Cj). exp(ak). j exp(aj). ak = ln p(x|Ck)p(Ck).. (4.62). (4.63). which is known as the normalized exponential and can be regarded as a multiclass. generalization of the logistic sigmoid. Here the quantities ak are defined by. The normalized exponential is also known as the softmax function, as it represents. a smoothed version of the ‘max’ function because, if ak. aj for all j = k, then. p(Ck|x)  1, and p(Cj|x)  0.. We now investigate the consequences of choosing specific forms for the class-. conditional densities, looking first at continuous input variables x and then dis-. cussing briefly the case of discrete inputs.. "
69,4.2.1,Continuous inputs,"Let us assume that the class-conditional densities are Gaussian and then explore. the resulting form for the posterior probabilities. To start with, we shall assume that. all classes share the same covariance matrix. Thus the density for class Ck is given. by. 1. 1. p(x|Ck) =. (x − µk)TΣ−1(x − µk). Consider first the case of two classes. From (4.57) and (4.58), we have. |Σ|1/2. (2π)D/2. exp. 1. 2. where we have defined. p(C1|x) = σ(wTx + w0). w = Σ−1(µ1 − µ2). 1 Σ−1µ1 +. w0 = −. 1. 2 µT. 1. 2 µT. 2 Σ−1µ2 + ln p(C1). p(C2) .. (4.64). (4.65). (4.66). (4.67). We see that the quadratic terms in x from the exponents of the Gaussian densities. have cancelled (due to the assumption of common covariance matrices) leading to. a linear function of x in the argument of the logistic sigmoid. This result is illus-. trated for the case of a two-dimensional input space x in Figure 4.10. The resulting. 4.2. Probabilistic Generative Models. 199. Figure 4.10 The left-hand plot shows the class-conditional densities for two classes, denoted red and blue.. On the right is the corresponding posterior probability p(C1|x), which is given by a logistic sigmoid of a linear. function of x. The surface in the right-hand plot is coloured using a proportion of red ink given by p(C1|x) and a. proportion of blue ink given by p(C2|x) = 1 − p(C1|x).. decision boundaries correspond to surfaces along which the posterior probabilities. p(Ck|x) are constant and so will be given by linear functions of x, and therefore. the decision boundaries are linear in input space. The prior probabilities p(Ck) enter. only through the bias parameter w0 so that changes in the priors have the effect of. making parallel shifts of the decision boundary and more generally of the parallel. contours of constant posterior probability.. For the general case of K classes we have, from (4.62) and (4.63),. where we have defined. ak(x) = wT. k x + wk0. wk = Σ−1µk. 1. wk0 = −. 2 µT. k Σ−1µk + ln p(Ck).. (4.68). (4.69). (4.70). We see that the ak(x) are again linear functions of x as a consequence of the cancel-. lation of the quadratic terms due to the shared covariances. The resulting decision. boundaries, corresponding to the minimum misclassification rate, will occur when. two of the posterior probabilities (the two largest) are equal, and so will be defined. by linear functions of x, and so again we have a generalized linear model.. If we relax the assumption of a shared covariance matrix and allow each class-. conditional density p(x|Ck) to have its own covariance matrix Σk, then the earlier. cancellations will no longer occur, and we will obtain quadratic functions of x, giv-. ing rise to a quadratic discriminant. The linear and quadratic decision boundaries. are illustrated in Figure 4.11.. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. 200. 2.5. 2. 1.5. 1. 0.5. 0. −0.5. −1. −1.5. −2. −2.5. N. −2. −1. 0. 1. 2.

The right-hand plot shows the corresponding posterior probabilities, in which the RGB colour vector represents. the posterior probabilities for the respective three classes. The decision boundaries are also shown. Notice that. the boundary between the red and green classes, which have the same covariance matrix, is linear, whereas. those between the other pairs of classes are quadratic.. "
70,4.2.2,Maximum likelihood solution,"Once we have specified a parametric functional form for the class-conditional. densities p(x|Ck), we can then determine the values of the parameters, together with. the prior class probabilities p(Ck), using maximum likelihood. This requires a data. set comprising observations of x along with their corresponding class labels.. Consider first the case of two classes, each having a Gaussian class-conditional. density with a shared covariance matrix, and suppose we have a data set {xn, tn}. where n = 1, . . . , N. Here tn = 1 denotes class C1 and tn = 0 denotes class C2. We. denote the prior class probability p(C1) = π, so that p(C2) = 1 − π. For a data point. xn from class C1, we have tn = 1 and hence. p(xn,C1) = p(C1)p(xn|C1) = πN (xn|µ1, Σ).. Similarly for class C2, we have tn = 0 and hence. p(xn,C2) = p(C2)p(xn|C2) = (1 − π)N (xn|µ2, Σ).. Thus the likelihood function is given by. p(t|π, µ1, µ2, Σ) =. n=1. [πN (xn|µ1, Σ)]tn [(1 − π)N (xn|µ2, Σ)]1−tn. (4.71). where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. As usual, it is convenient to maximize the log of the. likelihood function. Consider first the maximization with respect to π. The terms in. N. n=1. N. n=1. n=1. n=1. n=1. N. N. N. 1. N1. n=1. n=1. n=1. N. N. N. n=1. N. N. Exercise 4.9. 201. (4.72). (4.74). (4.75).

Setting the derivative with respect to π equal to zero and rearranging, we obtain. 1. N. tn = N1. N. N1. N1 + N2. (4.73). where N1 denotes the total number of data points in class C1, and N2 denotes the total. number of data points in class C2. Thus the maximum likelihood estimate for π is. simply the fraction of points in class C1 as expected. This result is easily generalized. to the multiclass case where again the maximum likelihood estimate of the prior. probability associated with class Ck is given by the fraction of the training set points. assigned to that class.. Now consider the maximization with respect to µ1. Again we can pick out of. the log likelihood function those terms that depend on µ1 giving. tn lnN (xn|µ1, Σ) = −. tn(xn − µ1)TΣ−1(xn − µ1) + const.. 1. 2. Setting the derivative with respect to µ1 to zero and rearranging, we obtain. which is simply the mean of all the input vectors xn assigned to class C1. By a. similar argument, the corresponding result for µ2 is given by. µ1 =. tnxn. µ2 =. 1. N2. (1 − tn)xn. which again is the mean of all the input vectors xn assigned to class C2..

Using the standard result for the maximum likelihood solution for a Gaussian distri-. bution, we see that Σ = S, which represents a weighted average of the covariance. matrices associated with each of the two classes separately.. This result is easily extended to the K class problem to obtain the corresponding. maximum likelihood solutions for the parameters in which each class-conditional. density is Gaussian with a shared covariance matrix. Note that the approach of fitting. Gaussian distributions to the classes is not robust to outliers, because the maximum. likelihood estimation of a Gaussian is not robust.. "
71,4.2.3,Discrete features,"Let us now consider the case of discrete feature values xi. For simplicity, we. begin by looking at binary feature values xi ∈ {0, 1} and discuss the extension to. more general discrete features shortly. If there are D inputs, then a general distribu-. tion would correspond to a table of 2D numbers for each class, containing 2D − 1. independent variables (due to the summation constraint). Because this grows expo-. nentially with the number of features, we might seek a more restricted representa-. tion. Here we will make the naive Bayes assumption in which the feature values are. treated as independent, conditioned on the class Ck. Thus we have class-conditional. distributions of the form. p(x|Ck) =. i=1. ki(1 − µki)1−xi. µxi. (4.81). which contain D independent parameters for each class. Substituting into (4.63) then. gives. ak(x) =. i=1. {xi ln µki + (1 − xi) ln(1 − µki)} + ln p(Ck). (4.82). which again are linear functions of the input values xi. For the case of K = 2 classes,. we can alternatively consider the logistic sigmoid formulation given by (4.57). Anal-. ogous results are obtained for discrete variables each of which can take M > 2. states.. "

These are particular cases. of a more general result obtained by assuming that the class-conditional densities. p(x|Ck) are members of the exponential family of distributions.. distribution of x can be written in the form. Using the form (2.194) for members of the exponential family, we see that the. p(x|λk) = h(x)g(λk) exp. k u(x). λT. (4.83). We now restrict attention to the subclass of such distributions for which u(x) = x.. Then we make use of (2.236) to introduce a scaling parameter s, so that we obtain. the restricted set of exponential family class-conditional densities of the form. p(x|λk, s) =. 1. s. h. 1. s. x. g(λk) exp. 1. s. λT. k x. (4.84). Note that we are allowing each class to have its own parameter vector λk but we are. assuming that the classes share the same scale parameter s.. For the two-class problem, we substitute this expression for the class-conditional. densities into (4.58) and we see that the posterior class probability is again given by. a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function a(x) which is given by. a(x) = (λ1 − λ2)Tx + ln g(λ1) − ln g(λ2) + ln p(C1) − ln p(C2).. (4.85). Similarly, for the K-class problem, we substitute the class-conditional density ex-. pression into (4.63) to give. ak(x) = λT. k x + ln g(λk) + ln p(Ck). (4.86). and so again is a linear function of x.. 4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models. For the two-class classification problem, we have seen that the posterior probability. of class C1 can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of x, for a. wide choice of class-conditional distributions p(x|Ck). Similarly, for the multiclass. case, the posterior probability of class Ck is given by a softmax transformation of a. linear function of x. For specific choices of the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck),. we have used maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the densities as. well as the class priors p(Ck) and then used Bayes’ theorem to find the posterior class. probabilities.. However, an alternative approach is to use the functional form of the generalized. linear model explicitly and to determine its parameters directly by using maximum. likelihood. We shall see that there is an efficient algorithm finding such solutions. known as iterative reweighted least squares, or IRLS..

In the direct approach, we are maximizing a likelihood. function defined through the conditional distribution p(Ck|x), which represents a. form of discriminative training. One advantage of the discriminative approach is. that there will typically be fewer adaptive parameters to be determined, as we shall. see shortly. It may also lead to improved predictive performance, particularly when. the class-conditional density assumptions give a poor approximation to the true dis-. tributions.. "
74,4.3.1,Fixed basis functions,"So far in this chapter, we have considered classification models that work di-. rectly with the original input vector x. However, all of the algorithms are equally. applicable if we first make a fixed nonlinear transformation of the inputs using a. vector of basis functions φ(x). The resulting decision boundaries will be linear in. the feature space φ, and these correspond to nonlinear decision boundaries in the. original x space, as illustrated in Figure 4.12. Classes that are linearly separable. in the feature space φ(x) need not be linearly separable in the original observation. space x. Note that as in our discussion of linear models for regression, one of the. 4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models. 205. basis functions is typically set to a constant, say φ0(x) = 1, so that the correspond-. ing parameter w0 plays the role of a bias. For the remainder of this chapter, we shall. include a fixed basis function transformation φ(x), as this will highlight some useful. similarities to the regression models discussed in Chapter 3.. For many problems of practical interest, there is significant overlap between. the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck). This corresponds to posterior probabilities. p(Ck|x), which, for at least some values of x, are not 0 or 1. In such cases, the opti-. mal solution is obtained by modelling the posterior probabilities accurately and then. applying standard decision theory, as discussed in Chapter 1. Note that nonlinear. transformations φ(x) cannot remove such class overlap. Indeed, they can increase. the level of overlap, or create overlap where none existed in the original observation. space. However, suitable choices of nonlinearity can make the process of modelling. the posterior probabilities easier.. Such fixed basis function models have important limitations, and these will be. resolved in later chapters by allowing the basis functions themselves to adapt to the. data. Notwithstanding these limitations, models with fixed nonlinear basis functions. play an important role in applications, and a discussion of such models will intro-. duce many of the key concepts needed for an understanding of their more complex. counterparts.. "
75,4.3.2,Logistic regression,"We begin our treatment of generalized linear models by considering the problem. of two-class classification. In our discussion of generative approaches in Section 4.2,. we saw that under rather general assumptions, the posterior probability of class C1. can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of the feature vector. φ so that. p(C1|φ) = y(φ) = σ. (4.87). with p(C2|φ) = 1 − p(C1|φ). Here σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid function defined by. (4.59). In the terminology of statistics, this model is known as logistic regression,. although it should be emphasized that this is a model for classification rather than. regression.. wTφ. For an M-dimensional feature space φ, this model has M adjustable parameters.. By contrast, if we had fitted Gaussian class conditional densities using maximum. likelihood, we would have used 2M parameters for the means and M(M + 1)/2. parameters for the (shared) covariance matrix. Together with the class prior p(C1),. this gives a total of M(M +5)/2+1 parameters, which grows quadratically with M,. in contrast to the linear dependence on M of the number of parameters in logistic. regression. For large values of M, there is a clear advantage in working with the. logistic regression model directly.. We now use maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the logistic. regression model. To do this, we shall make use of the derivative of the logistic sig-. moid function, which can conveniently be expressed in terms of the sigmoid function. itself. dσ. da. = σ(1 − σ).. (4.88). Section 3.6. Exercise 4.12. n=1. N. N. n=1. N. Exercise 4.13. Section 3.1.1. Exercise 4.14. E(w) = − ln p(t|w) = −. {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)}. (4.90). where yn = σ(an) and an = wTφn. Taking the gradient of the error function with. respect to w, we obtain. ∇E(w) =. (yn − tn)φn. n=1. (4.91). where we have made use of (4.88). We see that the factor involving the derivative. of the logistic sigmoid has cancelled, leading to a simplified form for the gradient. of the log likelihood. In particular, the contribution to the gradient from data point. n is given by the ‘error’ yn − tn between the target value and the prediction of the. model, times the basis function vector φn. Furthermore, comparison with (3.13). shows that this takes precisely the same form as the gradient of the sum-of-squares. error function for the linear regression model.. If desired, we could make use of the result (4.91) to give a sequential algorithm. in which patterns are presented one at a time, in which each of the weight vectors is. updated using (3.22) in which ∇En is the nth term in (4.91).. It is worth noting that maximum likelihood can exhibit severe over-fitting for. data sets that are linearly separable. This arises because the maximum likelihood so-. lution occurs when the hyperplane corresponding to σ = 0.5, equivalent to wTφ =. 0, separates the two classes and the magnitude of w goes to infinity. In this case, the. logistic sigmoid function becomes infinitely steep in feature space, corresponding to. a Heaviside step function, so that every training point from each class k is assigned. a posterior probability p(Ck|x) = 1. Furthermore, there is typically a continuum. of such solutions because any separating hyperplane will give rise to the same pos-. terior probabilities at the training data points, as will be seen later in Figure 10.13.. Maximum likelihood provides no way to favour one such solution over another, and. which solution is found in practice will depend on the choice of optimization algo-. rithm and on the parameter initialization. Note that the problem will arise even if. the number of data points is large compared with the number of parameters in the. model, so long as the training data set is linearly separable. The singularity can be. avoided by inclusion of a prior and finding a MAP solution for w, or equivalently by. adding a regularization term to the error function.. 206. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. For a data set {φn, tn}, where tn ∈ {0, 1} and φn = φ(xn), with n =. 1, . . . , N, the likelihood function can be written. p(t|w) =. n {1 − yn}1−tn. ytn. (4.89). where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T and yn = p(C1|φn). As usual, we can define an error. function by taking the negative logarithm of the likelihood, which gives the cross-. entropy error function in the form. n=1. N. N. n=1. N. N. 4.3.

76,4.3.3,Iterative reweighted least squares,"In the case of the linear regression models discussed in Chapter 3, the maxi-. mum likelihood solution, on the assumption of a Gaussian noise model, leads to a. closed-form solution. This was a consequence of the quadratic dependence of the. log likelihood function on the parameter vector w. For logistic regression, there. is no longer a closed-form solution, due to the nonlinearity of the logistic sigmoid. function. However, the departure from a quadratic form is not substantial. To be. precise, the error function is concave, as we shall see shortly, and hence has a unique. minimum. Furthermore, the error function can be minimized by an efficient iterative. technique based on the Newton-Raphson iterative optimization scheme, which uses a. local quadratic approximation to the log likelihood function. The Newton-Raphson. update, for minimizing a function E(w), takes the form (Fletcher, 1987; Bishop and. Nabney, 2008). (4.92). where H is the Hessian matrix whose elements comprise the second derivatives of. E(w) with respect to the components of w.. w(new) = w(old) − H−1∇E(w).. Let us first of all apply the Newton-Raphson method to the linear regression. model (3.3) with the sum-of-squares error function (3.12). The gradient and Hessian. of this error function are given by. ∇E(w) =. (wTφn − tn)φn = ΦTΦw − ΦTt. H = ∇∇E(w) =. φnφT. n = ΦTΦ. w(new) = w(old) − (ΦTΦ)−1. = (ΦTΦ)−1ΦTt. ΦTΦw(old) − ΦTt. (4.95). which we recognize as the standard least-squares solution. Note that the error func-. tion in this case is quadratic and hence the Newton-Raphson formula gives the exact. solution in one step.. Now let us apply the Newton-Raphson update to the cross-entropy error function. (4.90) for the logistic regression model. From (4.91) we see that the gradient and. Hessian of this error function are given by. ∇E(w) =. n=1. (yn − tn)φn = ΦT(y − t). H = ∇∇E(w) =. n=1. yn(1 − yn)φnφT. n = ΦTRΦ. (4.93). (4.94). (4.96). (4.97).

We see that the Hessian is no longer constant but depends on w through the weight-. ing matrix R, corresponding to the fact that the error function is no longer quadratic.. Using the property 0 < yn < 1, which follows from the form of the logistic sigmoid. function, we see that uTHu > 0 for an arbitrary vector u, and so the Hessian matrix. H is positive definite. It follows that the error function is a concave function of w. and hence has a unique minimum.. The Newton-Raphson update formula for the logistic regression model then be-.

(4.100). We see that the update formula (4.99) takes the form of a set of normal equations for a. weighted least-squares problem. Because the weighing matrix R is not constant but. depends on the parameter vector w, we must apply the normal equations iteratively,. each time using the new weight vector w to compute a revised weighing matrix. R. For this reason, the algorithm is known as iterative reweighted least squares, or. IRLS (Rubin, 1983). As in the weighted least-squares problem, the elements of the. diagonal weighting matrix R can be interpreted as variances because the mean and. variance of t in the logistic regression model are given by. E[t] = σ(x) = y. var[t] = E[t2] − E[t]2 = σ(x) − σ(x)2 = y(1 − y). (4.101). (4.102). where we have used the property t2 = t for t ∈ {0, 1}. In fact, we can interpret IRLS. as the solution to a linearized problem in the space of the variable a = wTφ. The. quantity zn, which corresponds to the nth element of z, can then be given a simple. interpretation as an effective target value in this space obtained by making a local. linear approximation to the logistic sigmoid function around the current operating. point w(old). an(w)  an(w(old)) +. nw(old) −. = φT. w(old). dan. dyn.

77,4.3.4,Multiclass logistic regression,"In our discussion of generative models for multiclass classification, we have. seen that for a large class of distributions, the posterior probabilities are given by a. softmax transformation of linear functions of the feature variables, so that. p(Ck|φ) = yk(φ) =. exp(ak). j exp(aj). where the ‘activations’ ak are given by. ak = wT. k φ.. (4.104). (4.105). (4.106). There we used maximum likelihood to determine separately the class-conditional. densities and the class priors and then found the corresponding posterior probabilities. using Bayes’ theorem, thereby implicitly determining the parameters {wk}. Here we. consider the use of maximum likelihood to determine the parameters {wk} of this. model directly. To do this, we will require the derivatives of yk with respect to all of. the activations aj. These are given by. ∂yk. ∂aj. = yk(Ikj − yj). where Ikj are the elements of the identity matrix.. Next we write down the likelihood function. This is most easily done using. the 1-of-K coding scheme in which the target vector tn for a feature vector φn. belonging to class Ck is a binary vector with all elements zero except for element k,. which equals one. The likelihood function is then given by. p(T|w1, . . . , wK) =. n=1. k=1. p(Ck|φn)tnk =. ytnk. nk. (4.107). where ynk = yk(φn), and T is an N × K matrix of target variables with elements. tnk. Taking the negative logarithm then gives. E(w1, . . . , wK) = − ln p(T|w1, . . . , wK) = −. tnk ln ynk. (4.108). n=1. k=1. which is known as the cross-entropy error function for the multiclass classification. problem.. We now take the gradient of the error function with respect to one of the param-. eter vectors wj. Making use of the result (4.106) for the derivatives of the softmax. function, we obtain. ∇wj E(w1, . . . , wK) =. (ynj − tnj) φn. n=1. (4.109). Section 4.2. Exercise 4.17. Exercise 4.18. N. 210. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. k tnk = 1. Once again, we see the same form arising. where we have made use of. for the gradient as was found for the sum-of-squares error function with the linear. model and the cross-entropy error for the logistic regression model, namely the prod-. uct of the error (ynj − tnj) times the basis function φn. Again, we could use this. to formulate a sequential algorithm in which patterns are presented one at a time, in. which each of the weight vectors is updated using (3.22).. We have seen that the derivative of the log likelihood function for a linear regres-. sion model with respect to the parameter vector w for a data point n took the form. of the ‘error’ yn − tn times the feature vector φn. Similarly, for the combination. of logistic sigmoid activation function and cross-entropy error function (4.90), and. for the softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function. (4.108), we again obtain this same simple form. This is an example of a more general. result, as we shall see in Section 4.3.6.. To find a batch algorithm, we again appeal to the Newton-Raphson update to. obtain the corresponding IRLS algorithm for the multiclass problem. This requires. evaluation of the Hessian matrix that comprises blocks of size M × M in which. block j, k is given by. Exercise 4.20. ∇wk∇wj E(w1, . . . , wK) = −. ynk(Ikj − ynj)φnφT. n.. n=1. (4.110). As with the two-class problem, the Hessian matrix for the multiclass logistic regres-. sion model is positive definite and so the error function again has a unique minimum.. Practical details of IRLS for the multiclass case can be found in Bishop and Nabney. (2008).. "
78,4.3.5,Probit regression,"We have seen that, for a broad range of class-conditional distributions, described. by the exponential family, the resulting posterior class probabilities are given by a. logistic (or softmax) transformation acting on a linear function of the feature vari-. ables. However, not all choices of class-conditional density give rise to such a simple. form for the posterior probabilities (for instance, if the class-conditional densities are. modelled using Gaussian mixtures). This suggests that it might be worth exploring. other types of discriminative probabilistic model. For the purposes of this chapter,. however, we shall return to the two-class case, and again remain within the frame-. work of generalized linear models so that. p(t = 1|a) = f(a). where a = wTφ, and f(·) is the activation function.. One way to motivate an alternative choice for the link function is to consider a. noisy threshold model, as follows. For each input φn, we evaluate an = wTφn and. then we set the target value according to. (4.111). tn = 1 if an � θ. tn = 0 otherwise.. (4.112). a. 4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models. 211.

Note that the value of the blue. curve at any point, such as that indicated by the vertical green. line, corresponds to the slope of the red curve at the same point.. Conversely, the value of the red curve at this point corresponds. to the area under the blue curve indicated by the shaded green. region. In the stochastic threshold model, the class label takes. the value t = 1 if the value of a = wTφ exceeds a threshold, oth-. erwise it takes the value t = 0. This is equivalent to an activation. function given by the cumulative distribution function f (a).. 1. 0.8. 0.6. 0.4. 0.2. 0. 0. 1. 2. 3. 4. If the value of θ is drawn from a probability density p(θ), then the corresponding. activation function will be given by the cumulative distribution function. f(a) =. p(θ) dθ. a. as illustrated in Figure 4.13.. As a specific example, suppose that the density p(θ) is given by a zero mean,. unit variance Gaussian. The corresponding cumulative distribution function is given. by. Φ(a) =. N (θ|0, 1) dθ. which is known as the probit function. It has a sigmoidal shape and is compared. with the logistic sigmoid function in Figure 4.9. Note that the use of a more gen-. eral Gaussian distribution does not change the model because this is equivalent to. a re-scaling of the linear coefficients w. Many numerical packages provide for the. evaluation of a closely related function defined by. (4.113). (4.114). erf(a) =. 2. a. 0. exp(−θ2/2) dθ. (4.115). Exercise 4.21. and known as the erf function or error function (not to be confused with the error. function of a machine learning model). It is related to the probit function by. Φ(a) =. 1. 2. 1 +. 1. √2. erf(a). (4.116). The generalized linear model based on a probit activation function is known as probit. regression.. We can determine the parameters of this model using maximum likelihood, by a. straightforward extension of the ideas discussed earlier. In practice, the results found. using probit regression tend to be similar to those of logistic regression. We shall,. 212. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. however, find another use for the probit model when we discuss Bayesian treatments. of logistic regression in Section 4.5.. One issue that can occur in practical applications is that of outliers, which can. arise for instance through errors in measuring the input vector x or through misla-. belling of the target value t. Because such points can lie a long way to the wrong side. of the ideal decision boundary, they can seriously distort the classifier. Note that the. logistic and probit regression models behave differently in this respect because the. tails of the logistic sigmoid decay asymptotically like exp(−x) for x → ∞, whereas. for the probit activation function they decay like exp(−x2), and so the probit model. can be significantly more sensitive to outliers.. However, both the logistic and the probit models assume the data is correctly. labelled. The effect of mislabelling is easily incorporated into a probabilistic model. by introducing a probability 	 that the target value t has been flipped to the wrong. value (Opper and Winther, 2000a), leading to a target value distribution for data point. x of the form. p(t|x) = (1 − 	)σ(x) + 	(1 − σ(x)).

79,4.3.6,Canonical link functions,"For the linear regression model with a Gaussian noise distribution, the error. function, corresponding to the negative log likelihood, is given by (3.12). If we take. the derivative with respect to the parameter vector w of the contribution to the error. function from a data point n, this takes the form of the ‘error’ yn − tn times the. feature vector φn, where yn = wTφn. Similarly, for the combination of the logistic. sigmoid activation function and the cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the. softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108),. we again obtain this same simple form. We now show that this is a general result. of assuming a conditional distribution for the target variable from the exponential. family, along with a corresponding choice for the activation function known as the. canonical link function.. We again make use of the restricted form (4.84) of exponential family distribu-. tions. Note that here we are applying the assumption of exponential family distribu-. tion to the target variable t, in contrast to Section 4.2.4 where we applied it to the. input vector x. We therefore consider conditional distributions of the target variable. of the form. p(t|η, s) =. 1. s. h. t. s. g(η) exp. (4.118). ηt. s.

80,4.4,The Laplace Approximation,"213. Thus y and η must related, and we denote this relation through η = ψ(y).. Following Nelder and Wedderburn (1972), we define a generalized linear model. to be one for which y is a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the input (or. feature) variables so that. y = f(wTφ). (4.120). where f(·) is known as the activation function in the machine learning literature, and. f−1(·) is known as the link function in statistics..

We now see that there is a considerable simplification if we choose a. particular form for the link function f−1(y) given by. f−1(y) = ψ(y). (4.123). which gives f(ψ(y)) = y and hence f(ψ)ψ(y) = 1. Also, because a = f−1(y),. we have a = ψ and hence f(a)ψ(y) = 1. In this case, the gradient of the error. function reduces to. ∇ ln E(w) =. 1. s. {yn − tn}φn.. n=1. (4.124). For the Gaussian s = β−1, whereas for the logistic model s = 1.. 4.4. The Laplace Approximation. In Section 4.5 we shall discuss the Bayesian treatment of logistic regression. As. we shall see, this is more complex than the Bayesian treatment of linear regression. models, discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.5. In particular, we cannot integrate exactly. 214. Chapter 10. Chapter 11. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. over the parameter vector w since the posterior distribution is no longer Gaussian.. It is therefore necessary to introduce some form of approximation. Later in the. book we shall consider a range of techniques based on analytical approximations. and numerical sampling.. Here we introduce a simple, but widely used, framework called the Laplace ap-. proximation, that aims to find a Gaussian approximation to a probability density. defined over a set of continuous variables. Consider first the case of a single contin-. uous variable z, and suppose the distribution p(z) is defined by. f(z) dz is the normalization coefficient. We shall suppose that the. where Z =. value of Z is unknown. In the Laplace method the goal is to find a Gaussian approx-. imation q(z) which is centred on a mode of the distribution p(z). The first step is to. find a mode of p(z), in other words a point z0 such that p(z0) = 0, or equivalently. p(z) =. f(z). 1. Z. df(z). dz. = 0.. z=z0. A Gaussian distribution has the property that its logarithm is a quadratic function. of the variables. We therefore consider a Taylor expansion of ln f(z) centred on the. mode z0 so that. where. Note that the first-order term in the Taylor expansion does not appear since z0 is a. local maximum of the distribution. Taking the exponential we obtain. ln f(z)  ln f(z0) −. 1. 2 A(z − z0)2. A = −. d2. dz2 ln f(z). z=z0. f(z)  f(z0) exp. A. 2. (z − z0)2. We can then obtain a normalized distribution q(z) by making use of the standard. result for the normalization of a Gaussian, so that. q(z) =. 1/2. exp. A. 2π. A. 2. (z − z0)2. (4.130). The Laplace approximation is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Note that the Gaussian. approximation will only be well defined if its precision A > 0, in other words the. stationary point z0 must be a local maximum, so that the second derivative of f(z). at the point z0 is negative..

We can extend the Laplace method to approximate a distribution p(z) = f(z)/Z. defined over an M-dimensional space z. At a stationary point z0 the gradient ∇f(z). will vanish. Expanding around this stationary point we have. ln f(z)  ln f(z0) −. (z − z0)TA(z − z0). 1. 2. where the M × M Hessian matrix A is defined by. A = − ∇∇ ln f(z)|z=z0. (4.131). (4.132). and ∇ is the gradient operator. Taking the exponential of both sides we obtain. f(z)  f(z0) exp. (z − z0)TA(z − z0). (4.133). 1. 2. The distribution q(z) is proportional to f(z) and the appropriate normalization coef-. ficient can be found by inspection, using the standard result (2.43) for a normalized. multivariate Gaussian, giving. q(z) = |A|1/2. (2π)M/2. exp. 1. 2. (z − z0)TA(z − z0). = N (z|z0, A−1). (4.134). where |A| denotes the determinant of A. This Gaussian distribution will be well. defined provided its precision matrix, given by A, is positive definite, which implies. that the stationary point z0 must be a local maximum, not a minimum or a saddle. point.. In order to apply the Laplace approximation we first need to find the mode z0,. and then evaluate the Hessian matrix at that mode. In practice a mode will typi-. cally be found by running some form of numerical optimization algorithm (Bishop. 216. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. and Nabney, 2008). Many of the distributions encountered in practice will be mul-. timodal and so there will be different Laplace approximations according to which. mode is being considered. Note that the normalization constant Z of the true distri-. bution does not need to be known in order to apply the Laplace method. As a result. of the central limit theorem, the posterior distribution for a model is expected to. become increasingly better approximated by a Gaussian as the number of observed. data points is increased, and so we would expect the Laplace approximation to be. most useful in situations where the number of data points is relatively large.. One major weakness of the Laplace approximation is that, since it is based on a. Gaussian distribution, it is only directly applicable to real variables. In other cases. it may be possible to apply the Laplace approximation to a transformation of the. variable. For instance if 0 � τ < ∞ then we can consider a Laplace approximation. of ln τ . The most serious limitation of the Laplace framework, however, is that. it is based purely on the aspects of the true distribution at a specific value of the. variable, and so can fail to capture important global properties. In Chapter 10 we. shall consider alternative approaches which adopt a more global perspective.. "
81,4.4.1,Model comparison and BIC,"As well as approximating the distribution p(z) we can also obtain an approxi-. mation to the normalization constant Z. Using the approximation (4.133) we have.

We can use the result (4.135) to. obtain an approximation to the model evidence which, as discussed in Section 3.4,. plays a central role in Bayesian model comparison.. Consider a data set D and a set of models {Mi} having parameters {θi}. For. each model we define a likelihood function p(D|θi,Mi). If we introduce a prior. p(θi|Mi) over the parameters, then we are interested in computing the model evi-. dence p(D|Mi) for the various models. From now on we omit the conditioning on. Mi to keep the notation uncluttered. From Bayes’ theorem the model evidence is. given by. (4.136). Identifying f(θ) = p(D|θ)p(θ) and Z = p(D), and applying the result (4.135), we. obtain. p(D|θ)p(θ) dθ.. p(D) =. ln p(D)  ln p(D|θMAP) + ln p(θMAP) + M. 2. 1. 2. ln|A|. (4.137). ln(2π) −.

A = −∇∇ ln p(D|θMAP)p(θMAP) = −∇∇ ln p(θMAP|D).. (4.138). The first term on the right hand side of (4.137) represents the log likelihood evalu-. ated using the optimized parameters, while the remaining three terms comprise the. ‘Occam factor’ which penalizes model complexity.. If we assume that the Gaussian prior distribution over parameters is broad, and. that the Hessian has full rank, then we can approximate (4.137) very roughly using. ln p(D)  ln p(D|θMAP) −. 1. 2 M ln N. (4.139). where N is the number of data points, M is the number of parameters in θ and. we have omitted additive constants. This is known as the Bayesian Information. Criterion (BIC) or the Schwarz criterion (Schwarz, 1978). Note that, compared to. AIC given by (1.73), this penalizes model complexity more heavily.. Complexity measures such as AIC and BIC have the virtue of being easy to. evaluate, but can also give misleading results. In particular, the assumption that the. Hessian matrix has full rank is often not valid since many of the parameters are not. ‘well-determined’. We can use the result (4.137) to obtain a more accurate estimate. of the model evidence starting from the Laplace approximation, as we illustrate in. the context of neural networks in Section 5.7.. 4.5. Bayesian Logistic Regression. We now turn to a Bayesian treatment of logistic regression. Exact Bayesian infer-. ence for logistic regression is intractable. In particular, evaluation of the posterior. distribution would require normalization of the product of a prior distribution and a. likelihood function that itself comprises a product of logistic sigmoid functions, one. for every data point. Evaluation of the predictive distribution is similarly intractable.. Here we consider the application of the Laplace approximation to the problem of. Bayesian logistic regression (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990; MacKay, 1992b).. "
83,4.5.1,Laplace approximation,"Recall from Section 4.4 that the Laplace approximation is obtained by finding. the mode of the posterior distribution and then fitting a Gaussian centred at that. mode. This requires evaluation of the second derivatives of the log posterior, which. is equivalent to finding the Hessian matrix.. Because we seek a Gaussian representation for the posterior distribution, it is. natural to begin with a Gaussian prior, which we write in the general form. p(w) = N (w|m0, S0). (4.140). 1. 2. N. n=1. N. 218. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. where m0 and S0 are fixed hyperparameters. The posterior distribution over w is. given by. (4.141). where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. Taking the log of both sides, and substituting for the prior. distribution using (4.140), and for the likelihood function using (4.89), we obtain. p(w|t) ∝ p(w)p(t|w). ln p(w|t) = −. (w − m0)TS−1. 0 (w − m0). n=1. {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)} + const. (4.142). where yn = σ(wTφn). To obtain a Gaussian approximation to the posterior dis-. tribution, we first maximize the posterior distribution to give the MAP (maximum. posterior) solution wMAP, which defines the mean of the Gaussian. The covariance. is then given by the inverse of the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log. likelihood, which takes the form. SN = −∇∇ ln p(w|t) = S−1. 0 +. yn(1 − yn)φnφT. n.. (4.143). The Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution therefore takes the form. q(w) = N (w|wMAP, SN ).. (4.144). Having obtained a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution, there. remains the task of marginalizing with respect to this distribution in order to make. predictions.. "
84,4.5.2,Predictive distribution,"The predictive distribution for class C1, given a new feature vector φ(x), is. obtained by marginalizing with respect to the posterior distribution p(w|t), which is. itself approximated by a Gaussian distribution q(w) so that. p(C1|φ, t) =. p(C1|φ, w)p(w|t) dw . σ(wTφ)q(w) dw. (4.145). with the corresponding probability for class C2 given by p(C2|φ, t) = 1− p(C1|φ, t).. To evaluate the predictive distribution, we first note that the function σ(wTφ) de-. pends on w only through its projection onto φ. Denoting a = wTφ, we have. σ(wTφ) =. δ(a − wTφ)σ(a) da. where δ(·) is the Dirac delta function. From this we obtain. (4.146). σ(wTφ)q(w) dw =. σ(a)p(a) da. (4.147). 4.5. Bayesian Logistic Regression. 219. (4.148). where. p(a) =. δ(a − wTφ)q(w) dw.. We can evaluate p(a) by noting that the delta function imposes a linear constraint. on w and so forms a marginal distribution from the joint distribution q(w) by inte-. grating out all directions orthogonal to φ. Because q(w) is Gaussian, we know from. Section 2.3.2 that the marginal distribution will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate. the mean and covariance of this distribution by taking moments, and interchanging. the order of integration over a and w, so that. µa = E[a] =. p(a)a da =. q(w)wTφ dw = wT. MAPφ.

Note that the distribution of a takes the same form as the predictive distribution. (3.58) for the linear regression model, with the noise variance set to zero. Thus our. variational approximation to the predictive distribution becomes. p(C1|t) =. σ(a)p(a) da =. σ(a)N (a|µa, σ2. a) da.. (4.151). This result can also be derived directly by making use of the results for the marginal. of a Gaussian distribution given in Section 2.3.2.. The integral over a represents the convolution of a Gaussian with a logistic sig-. moid, and cannot be evaluated analytically. We can, however, obtain a good approx-. imation (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990; MacKay, 1992b; Barber and Bishop,. 1998a) by making use of the close similarity between the logistic sigmoid function. σ(a) defined by (4.59) and the probit function Φ(a) defined by (4.114). In order to. obtain the best approximation to the logistic function we need to re-scale the hori-. zontal axis, so that we approximate σ(a) by Φ(λa). We can find a suitable value of. λ by requiring that the two functions have the same slope at the origin, which gives. λ2 = π/8. The similarity of the logistic sigmoid and the probit function, for this. choice of λ, is illustrated in Figure 4.9.. The advantage of using a probit function is that its convolution with a Gaussian. can be expressed analytically in terms of another probit function. Specifically we. can show that. Φ(λa)N (a|µ, σ2) da = Φ. (λ−2 + σ2)1/2. (4.152). Exercise 4.24. Exercise 4.25. Exercise 4.26. n. 220. 4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION. We now apply the approximation σ(a)  Φ(λa) to the probit functions appearing. on both sides of this equation, leading to the following approximation for the convo-. lution of a logistic sigmoid with a Gaussian. σ(a)N (a|µ, σ2) da  σ. κ(σ2)µ.

Thus if the decision criterion is based on minimizing misclassifica-. tion rate, with equal prior probabilities, then the marginalization over w has no ef-. fect. However, for more complex decision criteria it will play an important role.. Marginalization of the logistic sigmoid model under a Gaussian approximation to. the posterior distribution will be illustrated in the context of variational inference in. Figure 10.13..

85,5,Neural Networks,"In Chapters 3 and 4 we considered models for regression and classification that com-. prised linear combinations of fixed basis functions. We saw that such models have. useful analytical and computational properties but that their practical applicability. was limited by the curse of dimensionality. In order to apply such models to large-. scale problems, it is necessary to adapt the basis functions to the data.. Support vector machines (SVMs), discussed in Chapter 7, address this by first. defining basis functions that are centred on the training data points and then selecting. a subset of these during training. One advantage of SVMs is that, although the. training involves nonlinear optimization, the objective function is convex, and so the. solution of the optimization problem is relatively straightforward. The number of. basis functions in the resulting models is generally much smaller than the number of. training points, although it is often still relatively large and typically increases with. the size of the training set. The relevance vector machine, discussed in Section 7.2,. also chooses a subset from a fixed set of basis functions and typically results in much. 225. 226. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. sparser models. Unlike the SVM it also produces probabilistic outputs, although this. is at the expense of a nonconvex optimization during training.. An alternative approach is to fix the number of basis functions in advance but. allow them to be adaptive, in other words to use parametric forms for the basis func-. tions in which the parameter values are adapted during training. The most successful. model of this type in the context of pattern recognition is the feed-forward neural. network, also known as the multilayer perceptron, discussed in this chapter. In fact,. ‘multilayer perceptron’ is really a misnomer, because the model comprises multi-. ple layers of logistic regression models (with continuous nonlinearities) rather than. multiple perceptrons (with discontinuous nonlinearities). For many applications, the. resulting model can be significantly more compact, and hence faster to evaluate, than. a support vector machine having the same generalization performance. The price to. be paid for this compactness, as with the relevance vector machine, is that the like-. lihood function, which forms the basis for network training, is no longer a convex. function of the model parameters. In practice, however, it is often worth investing. substantial computational resources during the training phase in order to obtain a. compact model that is fast at processing new data.. The term ‘neural network’ has its origins in attempts to find mathematical rep-. resentations of information processing in biological systems (McCulloch and Pitts,. 1943; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart et al., 1986). Indeed,. it has been used very broadly to cover a wide range of different models, many of. which have been the subject of exaggerated claims regarding their biological plau-. sibility. From the perspective of practical applications of pattern recognition, how-. ever, biological realism would impose entirely unnecessary constraints. Our focus in. this chapter is therefore on neural networks as efficient models for statistical pattern. recognition. In particular, we shall restrict our attention to the specific class of neu-. ral networks that have proven to be of greatest practical value, namely the multilayer. perceptron.. We begin by considering the functional form of the network model, including. the specific parameterization of the basis functions, and we then discuss the prob-. lem of determining the network parameters within a maximum likelihood frame-. work, which involves the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This requires. the evaluation of derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the net-. work parameters, and we shall see how these can be obtained efficiently using the. technique of error backpropagation. We shall also show how the backpropagation. framework can be extended to allow other derivatives to be evaluated, such as the. Jacobian and Hessian matrices. Next we discuss various approaches to regulariza-. tion of neural network training and the relationships between them. We also consider. some extensions to the neural network model, and in particular we describe a gen-. eral framework for modelling conditional probability distributions known as mixture. density networks. Finally, we discuss the use of Bayesian treatments of neural net-. works. Additional background on neural network models can be found in Bishop. (1995a).. M. i=1. D. M. "
86,5.1,Feed-forward Network Functions,"227. 5.1. Feed-forward Network Functions. The linear models for regression and classification discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, re-. spectively, are based on linear combinations of fixed nonlinear basis functions φj(x). and take the form. y(x, w) = f. wjφj(x). j=1. (5.1). where f(·) is a nonlinear activation function in the case of classification and is the. identity in the case of regression. Our goal is to extend this model by making the. basis functions φj(x) depend on parameters and then to allow these parameters to. be adjusted, along with the coefficients {wj}, during training. There are, of course,. many ways to construct parametric nonlinear basis functions. Neural networks use. basis functions that follow the same form as (5.1), so that each basis function is itself. a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the inputs, where the coefficients in. the linear combination are adaptive parameters.. This leads to the basic neural network model, which can be described a series. of functional transformations. First we construct M linear combinations of the input. variables x1, . . . , xD in the form. aj =. w(1). ji xi + w(1). j0. (5.2). where j = 1, . . . , M, and the superscript (1) indicates that the corresponding param-. eters are in the first ‘layer’ of the network. We shall refer to the parameters w(1). ji as. weights and the parameters w(1). j0 as biases, following the nomenclature of Chapter 3.. The quantities aj are known as activations. Each of them is then transformed using. a differentiable, nonlinear activation function h(·) to give. zj = h(aj).. (5.3). These quantities correspond to the outputs of the basis functions in (5.1) that, in the. context of neural networks, are called hidden units. The nonlinear functions h(·) are. generally chosen to be sigmoidal functions such as the logistic sigmoid or the ‘tanh’. function. Following (5.1), these values are again linearly combined to give output. unit activations. ak =. w(2). kj zj + w(2). k0. j=1. (5.4). where k = 1, . . . , K, and K is the total number of outputs. This transformation cor-. responds to the second layer of the network, and again the w(2). k0 are bias parameters.. Finally, the output unit activations are transformed using an appropriate activation. function to give a set of network outputs yk. The choice of activation function is. determined by the nature of the data and the assumed distribution of target variables. Exercise 5.1. M. D. 228. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS.

Thus for standard regression problems, the activation function is the identity so. that yk = ak. Similarly, for multiple binary classification problems, each output unit. activation is transformed using a logistic sigmoid function so that. where. yk = σ(ak). σ(a) =. 1. 1 + exp(−a) .. (5.5). (5.6). Finally, for multiclass problems, a softmax activation function of the form (4.62). is used. The choice of output unit activation function is discussed in detail in Sec-. tion 5.2.. We can combine these various stages to give the overall network function that,. for sigmoidal output unit activation functions, takes the form. yk(x, w) = σ. w(2). kj h. w(1). ji xi + w(1). j0. + w(2). k0. (5.7). j=1. i=1. where the set of all weight and bias parameters have been grouped together into a. vector w. Thus the neural network model is simply a nonlinear function from a set. of input variables {xi} to a set of output variables {yk} controlled by a vector w of. adjustable parameters.. This function can be represented in the form of a network diagram as shown. in Figure 5.1. The process of evaluating (5.7) can then be interpreted as a forward. propagation of information through the network. It should be emphasized that these. diagrams do not represent probabilistic graphical models of the kind to be consid-. ered in Chapter 8 because the internal nodes represent deterministic variables rather. than stochastic ones. For this reason, we have adopted a slightly different graphical. i=0. D. M. D. 5.1. Feed-forward Network Functions. 229. notation for the two kinds of model. We shall see later how to give a probabilistic. interpretation to a neural network.. As discussed in Section 3.1, the bias parameters in (5.2) can be absorbed into. the set of weight parameters by defining an additional input variable x0 whose value. is clamped at x0 = 1, so that (5.2) takes the form. aj =. w(1). ji xi.. (5.8). We can similarly absorb the second-layer biases into the second-layer weights, so. that the overall network function becomes. yk(x, w) = σ. w(2). kj h. w(1). ji xi. (5.9). j=0. i=0. As can be seen from Figure 5.1, the neural network model comprises two stages. of processing, each of which resembles the perceptron model of Section 4.1.7, and. for this reason the neural network is also known as the multilayer perceptron, or. MLP. A key difference compared to the perceptron, however, is that the neural net-. work uses continuous sigmoidal nonlinearities in the hidden units, whereas the per-. ceptron uses step-function nonlinearities. This means that the neural network func-. tion is differentiable with respect to the network parameters, and this property will. play a central role in network training.. If the activation functions of all the hidden units in a network are taken to be. linear, then for any such network we can always find an equivalent network without. hidden units. This follows from the fact that the composition of successive linear. transformations is itself a linear transformation. However, if the number of hidden. units is smaller than either the number of input or output units, then the transforma-. tions that the network can generate are not the most general possible linear trans-. formations from inputs to outputs because information is lost in the dimensionality. reduction at the hidden units. In Section 12.4.2, we show that networks of linear. units give rise to principal component analysis. In general, however, there is little. interest in multilayer networks of linear units.. The network architecture shown in Figure 5.1 is the most commonly used one. in practice. However, it is easily generalized, for instance by considering additional. layers of processing each consisting of a weighted linear combination of the form. (5.4) followed by an element-wise transformation using a nonlinear activation func-. tion. Note that there is some confusion in the literature regarding the terminology. for counting the number of layers in such networks. Thus the network in Figure 5.1. may be described as a 3-layer network (which counts the number of layers of units,. and treats the inputs as units) or sometimes as a single-hidden-layer network (which. counts the number of layers of hidden units). We recommend a terminology in which. Figure 5.1 is called a two-layer network, because it is the number of layers of adap-. tive weights that is important for determining the network properties.. Another generalization of the network architecture is to include skip-layer con-. nections, each of which is associated with a corresponding adaptive parameter. For. inputs. x2. x1. 230. 5.

Note that. each hidden and output unit has an. associated bias parameter (omitted for. clarity).. z1. z2. z3. y2. outputs. y1. instance, in a two-layer network these would go directly from inputs to outputs. In. principle, a network with sigmoidal hidden units can always mimic skip layer con-. nections (for bounded input values) by using a sufficiently small first-layer weight. that, over its operating range, the hidden unit is effectively linear, and then com-. pensating with a large weight value from the hidden unit to the output. In practice,. however, it may be advantageous to include skip-layer connections explicitly.. Furthermore, the network can be sparse, with not all possible connections within. a layer being present. We shall see an example of a sparse network architecture when. we consider convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6.. Because there is a direct correspondence between a network diagram and its. mathematical function, we can develop more general network mappings by con-. sidering more complex network diagrams. However, these must be restricted to a. feed-forward architecture, in other words to one having no closed directed cycles, to. ensure that the outputs are deterministic functions of the inputs. This is illustrated. with a simple example in Figure 5.2. Each (hidden or output) unit in such a network. computes a function given by. zk = h. wkjzj. j. (5.10). where the sum runs over all units that send connections to unit k (and a bias param-. eter is included in the summation). For a given set of values applied to the inputs of. the network, successive application of (5.10) allows the activations of all units in the. network to be evaluated including those of the output units.. The approximation properties of feed-forward networks have been widely stud-. ied (Funahashi, 1989; Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Stinchecombe and White,. 1989; Cotter, 1990; Ito, 1991; Hornik, 1991; Kreinovich, 1991; Ripley, 1996) and. found to be very general. Neural networks are therefore said to be universal ap-. proximators. For example, a two-layer network with linear outputs can uniformly. approximate any continuous function on a compact input domain to arbitrary accu-. racy provided the network has a sufficiently large number of hidden units. This result. holds for a wide range of hidden unit activation functions, but excluding polynomi-. als. Although such theorems are reassuring, the key problem is how to find suitable. parameter values given a set of training data, and in later sections of this chapter we.

In. each case, N = 50 data points,. shown as blue dots, have been sam-. pled uniformly in x over the interval. (−1, 1) and the corresponding val-. ues of f (x) evaluated. These data. points are then used to train a two-. layer network having 3 hidden units. with ‘tanh’ activation functions and. linear output units.

(b). (d). will show that there exist effective solutions to this problem based on both maximum. likelihood and Bayesian approaches.. The capability of a two-layer network to model a broad range of functions is. illustrated in Figure 5.3. This figure also shows how individual hidden units work. collaboratively to approximate the final function. The role of hidden units in a simple. classification problem is illustrated in Figure 5.4 using the synthetic classification. data set described in Appendix A.. "
87,5.1.1,Weight-space symmetries,"One property of feed-forward networks, which will play a role when we consider. Bayesian model comparison, is that multiple distinct choices for the weight vector. w can all give rise to the same mapping function from inputs to outputs (Chen et al.,. 1993). Consider a two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 5.1 with M hidden. units having ‘tanh’ activation functions and full connectivity in both layers. If we. change the sign of all of the weights and the bias feeding into a particular hidden. unit, then, for a given input pattern, the sign of the activation of the hidden unit will. be reversed, because ‘tanh’ is an odd function, so that tanh(−a) = − tanh(a). This. transformation can be exactly compensated by changing the sign of all of the weights. leading out of that hidden unit. Thus, by changing the signs of a particular group of. weights (and a bias), the input–output mapping function represented by the network. is unchanged, and so we have found two different weight vectors that give rise to. the same mapping function. For M hidden units, there will be M such ‘sign-flip’. 232. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. Figure 5.4 Example of the solution of a simple two-. class classification problem involving. synthetic data using a neural network. having two inputs, two hidden units with. ‘tanh’ activation functions, and a single. output having a logistic sigmoid activa-. tion function.

Similarly, imagine that we interchange the values of all of the weights (and the. bias) leading both into and out of a particular hidden unit with the corresponding. values of the weights (and bias) associated with a different hidden unit. Again, this. clearly leaves the network input–output mapping function unchanged, but it corre-. sponds to a different choice of weight vector. For M hidden units, any given weight. vector will belong to a set of M! equivalent weight vectors associated with this inter-. change symmetry, corresponding to the M! different orderings of the hidden units.. The network will therefore have an overall weight-space symmetry factor of M!2M .. For networks with more than two layers of weights, the total level of symmetry will. be given by the product of such factors, one for each layer of hidden units.. It turns out that these factors account for all of the symmetries in weight space. (except for possible accidental symmetries due to specific choices for the weight val-. ues). Furthermore, the existence of these symmetries is not a particular property of. the ‘tanh’ function but applies to a wide range of activation functions (K˙urkov´a and. Kainen, 1994). In many cases, these symmetries in weight space are of little practi-. cal consequence, although in Section 5.7 we shall encounter a situation in which we. need to take them into account.. "
88,5.2,Network Training,"So far, we have viewed neural networks as a general class of parametric nonlinear. functions from a vector x of input variables to a vector y of output variables. A. simple approach to the problem of determining the network parameters is to make an. analogy with the discussion of polynomial curve fitting in Section 1.1, and therefore. to minimize a sum-of-squares error function. Given a training set comprising a set. of input vectors {xn}, where n = 1, . . . , N, together with a corresponding set of. n=1. N. N. N. N. n=1. target vectors {tn}, we minimize the error function. E(w) =. 1. 2. y(xn, w) − tn2.. 5.2. Network Training. 233. (5.11). However, we can provide a much more general view of network training by first. giving a probabilistic interpretation to the network outputs. We have already seen. many advantages of using probabilistic predictions in Section 1.5.4. Here it will also. provide us with a clearer motivation both for the choice of output unit nonlinearity. and the choice of error function.. We start by discussing regression problems, and for the moment we consider. a single target variable t that can take any real value. Following the discussions. in Section 1.2.5 and 3.1, we assume that t has a Gaussian distribution with an x-. dependent mean, which is given by the output of the neural network, so that. p(t|x, w) = N. t|y(x, w), β−1. (5.12). where β is the precision (inverse variance) of the Gaussian noise. Of course this. is a somewhat restrictive assumption, and in Section 5.6 we shall see how to extend. this approach to allow for more general conditional distributions. For the conditional. distribution given by (5.12), it is sufficient to take the output unit activation function. to be the identity, because such a network can approximate any continuous function. from x to y. Given a data set of N independent, identically distributed observations. X = {x1, . . . , xN}, along with corresponding target values t = {t1, . . . , tN}, we. can construct the corresponding likelihood function. p(t|X, w, β) =. p(tn|xn, w, β).. n=1. Taking the negative logarithm, we obtain the error function. 2. {y(xn, w) − tn}2 −. N. 2. ln β + N. 2. ln(2π). (5.13). which can be used to learn the parameters w and β. In Section 5.7, we shall dis-. cuss the Bayesian treatment of neural networks, while here we consider a maximum. likelihood approach. Note that in the neural networks literature, it is usual to con-. sider the minimization of an error function rather than the maximization of the (log). likelihood, and so here we shall follow this convention. Consider first the determi-. nation of w. Maximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to minimizing the. sum-of-squares error function given by. E(w) =. 1. 2. {y(xn, w) − tn}2. n=1. (5.14). n=1. N. N. 234. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. where we have discarded additive and multiplicative constants. The value of w found. by minimizing E(w) will be denoted wML because it corresponds to the maximum. likelihood solution. In practice, the nonlinearity of the network function y(xn, w). causes the error E(w) to be nonconvex, and so in practice local maxima of the. likelihood may be found, corresponding to local minima of the error function, as. discussed in Section 5.2.1.. Having found wML, the value of β can be found by minimizing the negative log. likelihood to give. 1. βML. 1. N. {y(xn, wML) − tn}2.. (5.15). Note that this can be evaluated once the iterative optimization required to find wML. is completed. If we have multiple target variables, and we assume that they are inde-. pendent conditional on x and w with shared noise precision β, then the conditional. distribution of the target values is given by. p(t|x, w) = N. t|y(x, w), β−1I. (5.16). Following the same argument as for a single target variable, we see that the maximum. likelihood weights are determined by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function. (5.11). The noise precision is then given by. Exercise 5.2. Exercise 5.3. 1. βML. 1. N K. y(xn, wML) − tn2. n=1. (5.17). where K is the number of target variables. The assumption of independence can be. dropped at the expense of a slightly more complex optimization problem.. Recall from Section 4.3.6 that there is a natural pairing of the error function. (given by the negative log likelihood) and the output unit activation function. In the. regression case, we can view the network as having an output activation function that. is the identity, so that yk = ak. The corresponding sum-of-squares error function. has the property. ∂E. ∂ak. = yk − tk. (5.18). which we shall make use of when discussing error backpropagation in Section 5.3.. Now consider the case of binary classification in which we have a single target. variable t such that t = 1 denotes class C1 and t = 0 denotes class C2. Following. the discussion of canonical link functions in Section 4.3.6, we consider a network. having a single output whose activation function is a logistic sigmoid. y = σ(a) ≡. 1. 1 + exp(−a). (5.19). so that 0 � y(x, w) � 1. We can interpret y(x, w) as the conditional probability. p(C1|x), with p(C2|x) given by 1 − y(x, w). The conditional distribution of targets. given inputs is then a Bernoulli distribution of the form. p(t|x, w) = y(x, w)t {1 − y(x, w)}1−t .. (5.20). n=1. K. N. K. k=1. N. N. K. If we consider a training set of independent observations, then the error function,. which is given by the negative log likelihood, is then a cross-entropy error function. of the form. E(w) = −. {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)}. (5.21). where yn denotes y(xn, w). Note that there is no analogue of the noise precision β. because the target values are assumed to be correctly labelled. However, the model. is easily extended to allow for labelling errors. Simard et al. (2003) found that using. the cross-entropy error function instead of the sum-of-squares for a classification. problem leads to faster training as well as improved generalization.. If we have K separate binary classifications to perform, then we can use a net-. work having K outputs each of which has a logistic sigmoid activation function.. Associated with each output is a binary class label tk ∈ {0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K.. If we assume that the class labels are independent, given the input vector, then the. conditional distribution of the targets is. p(t|x, w) =. yk(x, w)tk [1 − yk(x, w)]1−tk .. (5.22). Taking the negative logarithm of the corresponding likelihood function then gives. the following error function. E(w) = −. n=1. k=1. {tnk ln ynk + (1 − tnk) ln(1 − ynk)}. (5.23). where ynk denotes yk(xn, w). Again, the derivative of the error function with re-. spect to the activation for a particular output unit takes the form (5.18) just as in the. regression case.. It is interesting to contrast the neural network solution to this problem with the. corresponding approach based on a linear classification model of the kind discussed. in Chapter 4. Suppose that we are using a standard two-layer network of the kind. shown in Figure 5.1. We see that the weight parameters in the first layer of the. network are shared between the various outputs, whereas in the linear model each. classification problem is solved independently. The first layer of the network can. be viewed as performing a nonlinear feature extraction, and the sharing of features. between the different outputs can save on computation and can also lead to improved. generalization.. Finally, we consider the standard multiclass classification problem in which each. input is assigned to one of K mutually exclusive classes. The binary target variables. tk ∈ {0, 1} have a 1-of-K coding scheme indicating the class, and the network. outputs are interpreted as yk(x, w) = p(tk = 1|x), leading to the following error. function. E(w) = −. n=1. k=1. tkn ln yk(xn, w).. (5.24). 5.2. Network Training. 235. Exercise 5.4. Exercise 5.5. Exercise 5.6. 236. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS.

At any point wC, the local gradient of the error. surface is given by the vector ∇E.. E(w). wA. wB. wC. w1. w2. ∇E. Following the discussion of Section 4.3.4, we see that the output unit activation. function, which corresponds to the canonical link, is given by the softmax function. yk(x, w) =. (5.25). exp(ak(x, w)). exp(aj(x, w)). j. which satisfies 0 � yk � 1 and. k yk = 1. Note that the yk(x, w) are unchanged. if a constant is added to all of the ak(x, w), causing the error function to be constant. for some directions in weight space. This degeneracy is removed if an appropriate. regularization term (Section 5.5) is added to the error function.. Once again, the derivative of the error function with respect to the activation for. Exercise 5.7. a particular output unit takes the familiar form (5.18).. In summary, there is a natural choice of both output unit activation function. and matching error function, according to the type of problem being solved. For re-. gression we use linear outputs and a sum-of-squares error, for (multiple independent). binary classifications we use logistic sigmoid outputs and a cross-entropy error func-. tion, and for multiclass classification we use softmax outputs with the corresponding. multiclass cross-entropy error function. For classification problems involving two. classes, we can use a single logistic sigmoid output, or alternatively we can use a. network with two outputs having a softmax output activation function.. "
89,5.2.1,Parameter optimization,"We turn next to the task of finding a weight vector w which minimizes the. chosen function E(w). At this point, it is useful to have a geometrical picture of the. error function, which we can view as a surface sitting over weight space as shown in. Figure 5.5. First note that if we make a small step in weight space from w to w+ δw. then the change in the error function is δE  δwT∇E(w), where the vector ∇E(w). points in the direction of greatest rate of increase of the error function. Because the. error E(w) is a smooth continuous function of w, its smallest value will occur at a. Section 5.1.1. 5.2. Network Training. 237. point in weight space such that the gradient of the error function vanishes, so that. (5.26). as otherwise we could make a small step in the direction of −∇E(w) and thereby. further reduce the error. Points at which the gradient vanishes are called stationary. points, and may be further classified into minima, maxima, and saddle points.. ∇E(w) = 0. Our goal is to find a vector w such that E(w) takes its smallest value. How-. ever, the error function typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights. and bias parameters, and so there will be many points in weight space at which the. gradient vanishes (or is numerically very small). Indeed, from the discussion in Sec-. tion 5.1.1 we see that for any point w that is a local minimum, there will be other. points in weight space that are equivalent minima. For instance, in a two-layer net-. work of the kind shown in Figure 5.1, with M hidden units, each point in weight. space is a member of a family of M!2M equivalent points.. Furthermore, there will typically be multiple inequivalent stationary points and. in particular multiple inequivalent minima. A minimum that corresponds to the. smallest value of the error function for any weight vector is said to be a global. minimum. Any other minima corresponding to higher values of the error function. are said to be local minima. For a successful application of neural networks, it may. not be necessary to find the global minimum (and in general it will not be known. whether the global minimum has been found) but it may be necessary to compare. several local minima in order to find a sufficiently good solution.. Because there is clearly no hope of finding an analytical solution to the equa-. tion ∇E(w) = 0 we resort to iterative numerical procedures. The optimization of. continuous nonlinear functions is a widely studied problem and there exists an ex-. tensive literature on how to solve it efficiently. Most techniques involve choosing. some initial value w(0) for the weight vector and then moving through weight space. in a succession of steps of the form. w(τ +1) = w(τ ) + ∆w(τ ). (5.27). where τ labels the iteration step. Different algorithms involve different choices for. the weight vector update ∆w(τ ). Many algorithms make use of gradient information. and therefore require that, after each update, the value of ∇E(w) is evaluated at. the new weight vector w(τ +1). In order to understand the importance of gradient. information, it is useful to consider a local approximation to the error function based. on a Taylor expansion.. "
90,5.2.2,Local quadratic approximation,"Insight into the optimization problem, and into the various techniques for solv-. ing it, can be obtained by considering a local quadratic approximation to the error. function.. Consider the Taylor expansion of E(w) around some point. w in weight space. E(w)  E(. w) + (w −. w)Tb +. 1. 2. (w −. w)TH(w −. w). (5.28). 238. 5.

Consider the particular case of a local quadratic approximation around a point. w that is a minimum of the error function.

91,5.2.3,Use of gradient information,"As we shall see in Section 5.3, it is possible to evaluate the gradient of an error. function efficiently by means of the backpropagation procedure. The use of this. gradient information can lead to significant improvements in the speed with which. the minima of the error function can be located. We can see why this is so, as follows.. In the quadratic approximation to the error function, given in (5.28), the error. surface is specified by the quantities b and H, which contain a total of W (W +. 3)/2 independent elements (because the matrix H is symmetric), where W is the. dimensionality of w (i.e., the total number of adaptive parameters in the network).. The location of the minimum of this quadratic approximation therefore depends on. O(W 2) parameters, and we should not expect to be able to locate the minimum until. we have gathered O(W 2) independent pieces of information. If we do not make. use of gradient information, we would expect to have to perform O(W 2) function. Exercise 5.13. 240. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. evaluations, each of which would require O(W ) steps. Thus, the computational. effort needed to find the minimum using such an approach would be O(W 3).. Now compare this with an algorithm that makes use of the gradient information.. Because each evaluation of ∇E brings W items of information, we might hope to. find the minimum of the function in O(W ) gradient evaluations. As we shall see,. by using error backpropagation, each such evaluation takes only O(W ) steps and so. the minimum can now be found in O(W 2) steps. For this reason, the use of gradient. information forms the basis of practical algorithms for training neural networks.. N. "
92,5.2.4,Gradient descent optimization,"The simplest approach to using gradient information is to choose the weight. update in (5.27) to comprise a small step in the direction of the negative gradient, so. that. w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇E(w(τ )). (5.41). where the parameter η > 0 is known as the learning rate. After each such update, the. gradient is re-evaluated for the new weight vector and the process repeated. Note that. the error function is defined with respect to a training set, and so each step requires. that the entire training set be processed in order to evaluate ∇E. Techniques that. use the whole data set at once are called batch methods. At each step the weight. vector is moved in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of the error function,. and so this approach is known as gradient descent or steepest descent. Although. such an approach might intuitively seem reasonable, in fact it turns out to be a poor. algorithm, for reasons discussed in Bishop and Nabney (2008).. For batch optimization, there are more efficient methods, such as conjugate gra-. dients and quasi-Newton methods, which are much more robust and much faster. than simple gradient descent (Gill et al., 1981; Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright,. 1999). Unlike gradient descent, these algorithms have the property that the error. function always decreases at each iteration unless the weight vector has arrived at a. local or global minimum.. In order to find a sufficiently good minimum, it may be necessary to run a. gradient-based algorithm multiple times, each time using a different randomly cho-. sen starting point, and comparing the resulting performance on an independent vali-. dation set.. There is, however, an on-line version of gradient descent that has proved useful. in practice for training neural networks on large data sets (Le Cun et al., 1989).. Error functions based on maximum likelihood for a set of independent observations. comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point. E(w) =. En(w).. n=1. (5.42). On-line gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent or stochastic. gradient descent, makes an update to the weight vector based on one data point at a. time, so that. w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇En(w(τ )).. (5.43). "
93,5.3,Error Backpropagation,"241. This update is repeated by cycling through the data either in sequence or by selecting. points at random with replacement. There are of course intermediate scenarios in. which the updates are based on batches of data points.. One advantage of on-line methods compared to batch methods is that the former. handle redundancy in the data much more efficiently. To see, this consider an ex-. treme example in which we take a data set and double its size by duplicating every. data point. Note that this simply multiplies the error function by a factor of 2 and so. is equivalent to using the original error function. Batch methods will require double. the computational effort to evaluate the batch error function gradient, whereas on-. line methods will be unaffected. Another property of on-line gradient descent is the. possibility of escaping from local minima, since a stationary point with respect to. the error function for the whole data set will generally not be a stationary point for. each data point individually.. Nonlinear optimization algorithms, and their practical application to neural net-. work training, are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney (2008).. 5.3. Error Backpropagation. Our goal in this section is to find an efficient technique for evaluating the gradient. of an error function E(w) for a feed-forward neural network. We shall see that. this can be achieved using a local message passing scheme in which information is. sent alternately forwards and backwards through the network and is known as error. backpropagation, or sometimes simply as backprop.. It should be noted that the term backpropagation is used in the neural com-. puting literature to mean a variety of different things. For instance, the multilayer. perceptron architecture is sometimes called a backpropagation network. The term. backpropagation is also used to describe the training of a multilayer perceptron us-. ing gradient descent applied to a sum-of-squares error function. In order to clarify. the terminology, it is useful to consider the nature of the training process more care-. fully. Most training algorithms involve an iterative procedure for minimization of an. error function, with adjustments to the weights being made in a sequence of steps. At. each such step, we can distinguish between two distinct stages. In the first stage, the. derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights must be evaluated. As. we shall see, the important contribution of the backpropagation technique is in pro-. viding a computationally efficient method for evaluating such derivatives. Because. it is at this stage that errors are propagated backwards through the network, we shall. use the term backpropagation specifically to describe the evaluation of derivatives.. In the second stage, the derivatives are then used to compute the adjustments to be. made to the weights. The simplest such technique, and the one originally considered. by Rumelhart et al. (1986), involves gradient descent. It is important to recognize. that the two stages are distinct. Thus, the first stage, namely the propagation of er-. rors backwards through the network in order to evaluate derivatives, can be applied. to many other kinds of network and not just the multilayer perceptron. It can also be. applied to error functions other that just the simple sum-of-squares, and to the eval-. n=1. N. k. i. yk =. wkixi. En =. 1. 2. (ynk − tnk)2. ∂En. ∂wji. = (ynj − tnj)xni. (5.45). (5.46). (5.47). where ynk = yk(xn, w). The gradient of this error function with respect to a weight. wji is given by. which can be interpreted as a ‘local’ computation involving the product of an ‘error. signal’ ynj − tnj associated with the output end of the link wji and the variable xni. associated with the input end of the link. In Section 4.3.2, we saw how a similar. formula arises with the logistic sigmoid activation function together with the cross. entropy error function, and similarly for the softmax activation function together. with its matching cross-entropy error function. We shall now see how this simple. result extends to the more complex setting of multilayer feed-forward networks.. In a general feed-forward network, each unit computes a weighted sum of its. inputs of the form. aj =. wjizi. i. (5.48). 242. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. uation of other derivatives such as the Jacobian and Hessian matrices, as we shall. see later in this chapter. Similarly, the second stage of weight adjustment using the. calculated derivatives can be tackled using a variety of optimization schemes, many. of which are substantially more powerful than simple gradient descent.. "
94,5.3.1,Evaluation of error-function derivatives,"We now derive the backpropagation algorithm for a general network having ar-. bitrary feed-forward topology, arbitrary differentiable nonlinear activation functions,. and a broad class of error function. The resulting formulae will then be illustrated. using a simple layered network structure having a single layer of sigmoidal hidden. units together with a sum-of-squares error.. Many error functions of practical interest, for instance those defined by maxi-. mum likelihood for a set of i.i.d. data, comprise a sum of terms, one for each data. point in the training set, so that. E(w) =. En(w).. (5.44). Here we shall consider the problem of evaluating ∇En(w) for one such term in the. error function. This may be used directly for sequential optimization, or the results. can be accumulated over the training set in the case of batch methods.. Consider first a simple linear model in which the outputs yk are linear combina-. tions of the input variables xi so that. together with an error function that, for a particular input pattern n, takes the form. 5.3. Error Backpropagation. 243. where zi is the activation of a unit, or input, that sends a connection to unit j, and wji. is the weight associated with that connection. In Section 5.1, we saw that biases can. be included in this sum by introducing an extra unit, or input, with activation fixed. at +1. We therefore do not need to deal with biases explicitly. The sum in (5.48) is. transformed by a nonlinear activation function h(·) to give the activation zj of unit j. in the form. (5.49). Note that one or more of the variables zi in the sum in (5.48) could be an input, and. similarly, the unit j in (5.49) could be an output.. zj = h(aj).. For each pattern in the training set, we shall suppose that we have supplied the. corresponding input vector to the network and calculated the activations of all of. the hidden and output units in the network by successive application of (5.48) and. (5.49). This process is often called forward propagation because it can be regarded. as a forward flow of information through the network.. Now consider the evaluation of the derivative of En with respect to a weight. wji. The outputs of the various units will depend on the particular input pattern n.. However, in order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall omit the subscript n. from the network variables. First we note that En depends on the weight wji only. via the summed input aj to unit j. We can therefore apply the chain rule for partial. derivatives to give. ∂En. ∂wji. = ∂En. ∂aj. ∂aj. ∂wji. We now introduce a useful notation. δj ≡. ∂En. ∂aj. (5.50). (5.51). where the δ’s are often referred to as errors for reasons we shall see shortly. Using. (5.48), we can write. (5.52). (5.53). ∂aj. ∂wji. = zi.. Substituting (5.51) and (5.52) into (5.50), we then obtain. ∂En. ∂wji. = δjzi.. Equation (5.53) tells us that the required derivative is obtained simply by multiplying. the value of δ for the unit at the output end of the weight by the value of z for the unit. at the input end of the weight (where z = 1 in the case of a bias). Note that this takes. the same form as for the simple linear model considered at the start of this section.. Thus, in order to evaluate the derivatives, we need only to calculate the value of δj. for each hidden and output unit in the network, and then apply (5.53).. As we have seen already, for the output units, we have. δk = yk − tk. (5.54). k. δj ≡. ∂En. ∂ak. ∂ak. ∂aj. ∂En. ∂aj. (5.55). where the sum runs over all units k to which unit j sends connections. The arrange-. ment of units and weights is illustrated in Figure 5.7. Note that the units labelled k. could include other hidden units and/or output units. In writing down (5.55), we are. making use of the fact that variations in aj give rise to variations in the error func-. tion only through variations in the variables ak. If we now substitute the definition. of δ given by (5.51) into (5.55), and make use of (5.48) and (5.49), we obtain the. following backpropagation formula. δj = h(aj). wkjδk. k. (5.56). which tells us that the value of δ for a particular hidden unit can be obtained by. propagating the δ’s backwards from units higher up in the network, as illustrated. in Figure 5.7. Note that the summation in (5.56) is taken over the first index on. wkj (corresponding to backward propagation of information through the network),. whereas in the forward propagation equation (5.10) it is taken over the second index.. Because we already know the values of the δ’s for the output units, it follows that. by recursively applying (5.56) we can evaluate the δ’s for all of the hidden units in a. feed-forward network, regardless of its topology.. The backpropagation procedure can therefore be summarized as follows.. Error Backpropagation. 1. Apply an input vector xn to the network and forward propagate through. the network using (5.48) and (5.49) to find the activations of all the hidden. and output units.. 2. Evaluate the δk for all the output units using (5.54).. 3. Backpropagate the δ’s using (5.56) to obtain δj for each hidden unit in the. network.. 4. Use (5.53) to evaluate the required derivatives.. 244. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS.

For batch methods, the derivative of the total error E can then be obtained by. repeating the above steps for each pattern in the training set and then summing over. all patterns:. ∂E. ∂wji. ∂En. ∂wji. (5.57). In the above derivation we have implicitly assumed that each hidden or output unit in. the network has the same activation function h(·). The derivation is easily general-. ized, however, to allow different units to have individual activation functions, simply. by keeping track of which form of h(·) goes with which unit.. "
95,5.3.2,A simple example,"The above derivation of the backpropagation procedure allowed for general. forms for the error function, the activation functions, and the network topology. In. order to illustrate the application of this algorithm, we shall consider a particular. example. This is chosen both for its simplicity and for its practical importance, be-. cause many applications of neural networks reported in the literature make use of. this type of network. Specifically, we shall consider a two-layer network of the form. illustrated in Figure 5.1, together with a sum-of-squares error, in which the output. units have linear activation functions, so that yk = ak, while the hidden units have. logistic sigmoid activation functions given by. where. A useful feature of this function is that its derivative can be expressed in a par-. ticularly simple form:. (5.60). We also consider a standard sum-of-squares error function, so that for pattern n the. error is given by. h(a) = 1 − h(a)2.. h(a) ≡ tanh(a). tanh(a) = ea − e−a. ea + e−a .. En =. 1. 2.

For each pattern in the training set in turn, we first perform a forward propagation. using. aj =. K. Next we compute the δ’s for each output unit using. δk = yk − tk.. Then we backpropagate these to obtain δs for the hidden units using. (5.65). (5.66). 246. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. δj = (1 − z2. j ). k=1. wkjδk.. Finally, the derivatives with respect to the first-layer and second-layer weights are. given by. ∂En. ∂w(1). ji. = δjxi,. ∂En. ∂w(2). kj. = δkzj.. (5.67). "
96,5.3.3,Efficiency of backpropagation,"One of the most important aspects of backpropagation is its computational effi-. ciency. To understand this, let us examine how the number of computer operations. required to evaluate the derivatives of the error function scales with the total number. W of weights and biases in the network. A single evaluation of the error function. (for a given input pattern) would require O(W ) operations, for sufficiently large W .. This follows from the fact that, except for a network with very sparse connections,. the number of weights is typically much greater than the number of units, and so the. bulk of the computational effort in forward propagation is concerned with evaluat-. ing the sums in (5.48), with the evaluation of the activation functions representing a. small overhead. Each term in the sum in (5.48) requires one multiplication and one. addition, leading to an overall computational cost that is O(W ).. An alternative approach to backpropagation for computing the derivatives of the. error function is to use finite differences. This can be done by perturbing each weight. in turn, and approximating the derivatives by the expression. ∂En. ∂wji. = En(wji + 	) − En(wji). + O(	). (5.68). where 	  1. In a software simulation, the accuracy of the approximation to the. derivatives can be improved by making 	 smaller, until numerical roundoff problems. arise. The accuracy of the finite differences method can be improved significantly. by using symmetrical central differences of the form. ∂En. ∂wji. = En(wji + 	) − En(wji − 	). 2. + O(	2).. (5.69). Exercise 5.14. In this case, the O(	) corrections cancel, as can be verified by Taylor expansion on. the right-hand side of (5.69), and so the residual corrections are O(	2). The number. of computational steps is, however, roughly doubled compared with (5.68).. The main problem with numerical differentiation is that the highly desirable. O(W ) scaling has been lost. Each forward propagation requires O(W ) steps, and. Figure 5.8 Illustration of a modular pattern. recognition system in which the. Jacobian matrix can be used. to backpropagate error signals. from the outputs through to ear-. lier modules in the system.. u. x. 5.3. Error Backpropagation. 247. v. z. w. y. there are W weights in the network each of which must be perturbed individually, so. that the overall scaling is O(W 2).. However, numerical differentiation plays an important role in practice, because a. comparison of the derivatives calculated by backpropagation with those obtained us-. ing central differences provides a powerful check on the correctness of any software. implementation of the backpropagation algorithm. When training networks in prac-. tice, derivatives should be evaluated using backpropagation, because this gives the. greatest accuracy and numerical efficiency. However, the results should be compared. with numerical differentiation using (5.69) for some test cases in order to check the. correctness of the implementation.. "
97,5.3.4,The Jacobian matrix,"We have seen how the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights. can be obtained by the propagation of errors backwards through the network. The. technique of backpropagation can also be applied to the calculation of other deriva-. tives. Here we consider the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix, whose elements are. given by the derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the inputs. Jki ≡. ∂yk. ∂xi. (5.70). where each such derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held fixed. Jacobian. matrices play a useful role in systems built from a number of distinct modules, as. illustrated in Figure 5.8. Each module can comprise a fixed or adaptive function,. which can be linear or nonlinear, so long as it is differentiable. Suppose we wish. to minimize an error function E with respect to the parameter w in Figure 5.8. The. derivative of the error function is given by. ∂E. ∂w. k,j. ∂E. ∂yk. ∂yk. ∂zj. ∂zj. ∂w. (5.71). in which the Jacobian matrix for the red module in Figure 5.8 appears in the middle. term.. Because the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of the local sensitivity of the. outputs to changes in each of the input variables, it also allows any known errors ∆xi. i. j. j. associated with the inputs to be propagated through the trained network in order to. estimate their contribution ∆yk to the errors at the outputs, through the relation. ∆yk . ∂yk. ∂xi. ∆xi. (5.72). which is valid provided the |∆xi| are small. In general, the network mapping rep-. resented by a trained neural network will be nonlinear, and so the elements of the. Jacobian matrix will not be constants but will depend on the particular input vector. used. Thus (5.72) is valid only for small perturbations of the inputs, and the Jacobian. itself must be re-evaluated for each new input vector.. The Jacobian matrix can be evaluated using a backpropagation procedure that is. similar to the one derived earlier for evaluating the derivatives of an error function. with respect to the weights. We start by writing the element Jki in the form. Jki = ∂yk. ∂xi. ∂yk. ∂aj. ∂aj. ∂xi. wji. ∂yk. ∂aj. (5.73). where we have made use of (5.48). The sum in (5.73) runs over all units j to which. the input unit i sends connections (for example, over all units in the first hidden. layer in the layered topology considered earlier). We now write down a recursive. backpropagation formula to determine the derivatives ∂yk/∂aj. 248. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. ∂yk. ∂aj. l. ∂yk. ∂al. ∂al. ∂aj. = h(aj). wlj. ∂yk. ∂al. l. (5.74). where the sum runs over all units l to which unit j sends connections (corresponding. to the first index of wlj). Again, we have made use of (5.48) and (5.49). This. backpropagation starts at the output units for which the required derivatives can be. found directly from the functional form of the output-unit activation function. For. instance, if we have individual sigmoidal activation functions at each output unit,. then. ∂yk. ∂aj. whereas for softmax outputs we have. = δkjσ(aj). (5.75). (5.76). ∂yk. ∂aj. = δkjyk − ykyj.. We can summarize the procedure for evaluating the Jacobian matrix as follows.. Apply the input vector corresponding to the point in input space at which the Ja-. cobian matrix is to be found, and forward propagate in the usual way to obtain the. "

Next, for each row. k of the Jacobian matrix, corresponding to the output unit k, backpropagate using. the recursive relation (5.74), starting with (5.75) or (5.76), for all of the hidden units. in the network. Finally, use (5.73) to do the backpropagation to the inputs. The. Jacobian can also be evaluated using an alternative forward propagation formalism,. which can be derived in an analogous way to the backpropagation approach given. here.. Again, the implementation of such algorithms can be checked by using numeri-. cal differentiation in the form. ∂yk. ∂xi. = yk(xi + 	) − yk(xi − 	). 2. + O(	2). (5.77). which involves 2D forward propagations for a network having D inputs.. Exercise 5.15. 5.4. The Hessian Matrix. We have shown how the technique of backpropagation can be used to obtain the first. derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights in the network. Back-. propagation can also be used to evaluate the second derivatives of the error, given. by. ∂2E. ∂wji∂wlk. (5.78). Note that it is sometimes convenient to consider all of the weight and bias parameters. as elements wi of a single vector, denoted w, in which case the second derivatives. form the elements Hij of the Hessian matrix H, where i, j ∈ {1, . . . , W} and W is. the total number of weights and biases. The Hessian plays an important role in many. aspects of neural computing, including the following:. 1. Several nonlinear optimization algorithms used for training neural networks. are based on considerations of the second-order properties of the error surface,. which are controlled by the Hessian matrix (Bishop and Nabney, 2008).. 2. The Hessian forms the basis of a fast procedure for re-training a feed-forward. network following a small change in the training data (Bishop, 1991).. 3. The inverse of the Hessian has been used to identify the least significant weights. in a network as part of network ‘pruning’ algorithms (Le Cun et al., 1990).. 4. The Hessian plays a central role in the Laplace approximation for a Bayesian. neural network (see Section 5.7). Its inverse is used to determine the predic-. tive distribution for a trained network, its eigenvalues determine the values of. hyperparameters, and its determinant is used to evaluate the model evidence.. Various approximation schemes have been used to evaluate the Hessian matrix. for a neural network. However, the Hessian can also be calculated exactly using an. extension of the backpropagation technique.. k. 250. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. An important consideration for many applications of the Hessian is the efficiency. with which it can be evaluated. If there are W parameters (weights and biases) in the. network, then the Hessian matrix has dimensions W × W and so the computational. effort needed to evaluate the Hessian will scale like O(W 2) for each pattern in the. data set. As we shall see, there are efficient methods for evaluating the Hessian. whose scaling is indeed O(W 2).. "
99,5.4.1,Diagonal approximation,"Some of the applications for the Hessian matrix discussed above require the. inverse of the Hessian, rather than the Hessian itself. For this reason, there has. been some interest in using a diagonal approximation to the Hessian, in other words. one that simply replaces the off-diagonal elements with zeros, because its inverse is. trivial to evaluate. Again, we shall consider an error function that consists of a sum. of terms, one for each pattern in the data set, so that E =. n En. The Hessian can. then be obtained by considering one pattern at a time, and then summing the results. over all patterns. From (5.48), the diagonal elements of the Hessian, for pattern n,. can be written. ∂2En. ∂w2. ji. = ∂2En. ∂a2. j. z2. i .. (5.79). Using (5.48) and (5.49), the second derivatives on the right-hand side of (5.79) can. be found recursively using the chain rule of differential calculus to give a backprop-. agation equation of the form. ∂2En. ∂a2. j. = h(aj)2. k. k. wkjwkj. ∂2En. ∂ak∂ak. + h(aj). wkj. ∂En. ∂ak. (5.80). If we now neglect off-diagonal elements in the second-derivative terms, we obtain. (Becker and Le Cun, 1989; Le Cun et al., 1990). ∂2En. ∂a2. j. = h(aj)2. w2. kj. ∂2En. ∂a2. k. k. + h(aj). wkj. ∂En. ∂ak. k. (5.81). Note that the number of computational steps required to evaluate this approximation. is O(W ), where W is the total number of weight and bias parameters in the network,. compared with O(W 2) for the full Hessian.. Ricotti et al. (1988) also used the diagonal approximation to the Hessian, but. they retained all terms in the evaluation of ∂2En/∂a2. j and so obtained exact expres-. sions for the diagonal terms. Note that this no longer has O(W ) scaling. The major. problem with diagonal approximations, however, is that in practice the Hessian is. typically found to be strongly nondiagonal, and so these approximations, which are. driven mainly be computational convenience, must be treated with care..

100,5.4.2,Outer product approximation,"When neural networks are applied to regression problems, it is common to use. a sum-of-squares error function of the form. 1. 2. (yn − tn)2. (5.82). where we have considered the case of a single output in order to keep the notation. simple (the extension to several outputs is straightforward). We can then write the. Hessian matrix in the form. H = ∇∇E =. ∇yn∇yn +. (yn − tn)∇∇yn.. n=1. (5.83). If the network has been trained on the data set, and its outputs yn happen to be very. close to the target values tn, then the second term in (5.83) will be small and can. be neglected. More generally, however, it may be appropriate to neglect this term. by the following argument. Recall from Section 1.5.5 that the optimal function that. minimizes a sum-of-squares loss is the conditional average of the target data. The. quantity (yn − tn) is then a random variable with zero mean. If we assume that its. value is uncorrelated with the value of the second derivative term on the right-hand. side of (5.83), then the whole term will average to zero in the summation over n.. By neglecting the second term in (5.83), we arrive at the Levenberg–Marquardt. approximation or outer product approximation (because the Hessian matrix is built. up from a sum of outer products of vectors), given by. H . bnbT. n. n=1. (5.84). where bn = ∇yn = ∇an because the activation function for the output units is. simply the identity. Evaluation of the outer product approximation for the Hessian. is straightforward as it only involves first derivatives of the error function, which. can be evaluated efficiently in O(W ) steps using standard backpropagation. The. elements of the matrix can then be found in O(W 2) steps by simple multiplication.. It is important to emphasize that this approximation is only likely to be valid for a. network that has been trained appropriately, and that for a general network mapping. the second derivative terms on the right-hand side of (5.83) will typically not be. negligible.. In the case of the cross-entropy error function for a network with logistic sigmoid. output-unit activation functions, the corresponding approximation is given by. Exercise 5.16. Exercise 5.17. Exercise 5.19. Exercise 5.20. An analogous result can be obtained for multiclass networks having softmax output-. unit activation functions.. H . n=1. yn(1 − yn)bnbT. n.. (5.85). N. 252. 5.

101,5.4.3,Inverse Hessian,"We can use the outer-product approximation to develop a computationally ef-. ficient procedure for approximating the inverse of the Hessian (Hassibi and Stork,. 1993). First we write the outer-product approximation in matrix notation as. HN =. bnbT. n. n=1. (5.86). where bn ≡ ∇wan is the contribution to the gradient of the output unit activation. arising from data point n. We now derive a sequential procedure for building up the. Hessian by including data points one at a time. Suppose we have already obtained. the inverse Hessian using the first L data points. By separating off the contribution. from data point L + 1, we obtain. In order to evaluate the inverse of the Hessian, we now consider the matrix identity. HL+1 = HL + bL+1bT. L+1.. (5.87). M + vvT. −1 = M−1 −. (M−1v). vTM−1. 1 + vTM−1v. (5.88). where I is the unit matrix, which is simply a special case of the Woodbury identity. (C.7). If we now identify HL with M and bL+1 with v, we obtain. H−1. L+1 = H−1. L −. H−1. 1 + bT. L bL+1bT. L+1H−1. L+1H−1. L bL+1. L. (5.89). Exercise 5.21. In this way, data points are sequentially absorbed until L+1 = N and the whole data. set has been processed. This result therefore represents a procedure for evaluating. the inverse of the Hessian using a single pass through the data set. The initial matrix. H0 is chosen to be αI, where α is a small quantity, so that the algorithm actually. finds the inverse of H + αI. The results are not particularly sensitive to the precise. value of α. Extension of this algorithm to networks having more than one output is. straightforward.. We note here that the Hessian matrix can sometimes be calculated indirectly as. part of the network training algorithm. In particular, quasi-Newton nonlinear opti-. mization algorithms gradually build up an approximation to the inverse of the Hes-. sian during training. Such algorithms are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney. (2008).. "
102,5.4.4,Finite differences,"As in the case of the first derivatives of the error function, we can find the second. derivatives by using finite differences, with accuracy limited by numerical precision.. If we perturb each possible pair of weights in turn, we obtain. ∂wji∂wlk. ∂2E. 1. 4	2 {E(wji + 	, wlk + 	) − E(wji + 	, wlk − 	). −E(wji − 	, wlk + 	) + E(wji − 	, wlk − 	)} + O(	2).. (5.90). 5.4. The Hessian Matrix. 253. Again, by using a symmetrical central differences formulation, we ensure that the. residual errors are O(	2) rather than O(	). Because there are W 2 elements in the. Hessian matrix, and because the evaluation of each element requires four forward. propagations each needing O(W ) operations (per pattern), we see that this approach. will require O(W 3) operations to evaluate the complete Hessian. It therefore has. poor scaling properties, although in practice it is very useful as a check on the soft-. ware implementation of backpropagation methods.. A more efficient version of numerical differentiation can be found by applying. central differences to the first derivatives of the error function, which are themselves. calculated using backpropagation. This gives. ∂2E. ∂wji∂wlk. 1. 2. ∂E. ∂wji. (wlk + 	) −. ∂E. ∂wji. (wlk − 	). + O(	2).. (5.91). Because there are now only W weights to be perturbed, and because the gradients. can be evaluated in O(W ) steps, we see that this method gives the Hessian in O(W 2). operations.. "
103,5.4.5,Exact evaluation of the Hessian,"So far, we have considered various approximation schemes for evaluating the. Hessian matrix or its inverse. The Hessian can also be evaluated exactly, for a net-. work of arbitrary feed-forward topology, using extension of the technique of back-. propagation used to evaluate first derivatives, which shares many of its desirable. features including computational efficiency (Bishop, 1991; Bishop, 1992). It can be. applied to any differentiable error function that can be expressed as a function of. the network outputs and to networks having arbitrary differentiable activation func-. tions. The number of computational steps needed to evaluate the Hessian scales. like O(W 2). Similar algorithms have also been considered by Buntine and Weigend. (1993).. Here we consider the specific case of a network having two layers of weights,. for which the required equations are easily derived. We shall use indices i and i. to denote inputs, indices j and j to denoted hidden units, and indices k and k to. denote outputs. We first define. δk = ∂En. ∂ak. Mkk ≡. ∂2En. ∂ak∂ak. (5.92). where En is the contribution to the error from data point n. The Hessian matrix for. this network can then be considered in three separate blocks as follows.. 1. Both weights in the second layer:. ∂2En. kj ∂w(2). kj. ∂w(2). = zjzjMkk.. (5.93). Exercise 5.22. k. k. 254. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. 2.

If one or both of the weights is. a bias term, then the corresponding expressions are obtained simply by setting the. appropriate activation(s) to 1. Inclusion of skip-layer connections is straightforward.. "
104,5.4.6,Fast multiplication by the Hessian,"For many applications of the Hessian, the quantity of interest is not the Hessian. matrix H itself but the product of H with some vector v. We have seen that the. evaluation of the Hessian takes O(W 2) operations, and it also requires storage that is. O(W 2). The vector vTH that we wish to calculate, however, has only W elements,. so instead of computing the Hessian as an intermediate step, we can instead try to. find an efficient approach to evaluating vTH directly in a way that requires only. O(W ) operations.. To do this, we first note that. vTH = vT∇(∇E). (5.96). where ∇ denotes the gradient operator in weight space. We can then write down. the standard forward-propagation and backpropagation equations for the evaluation. of ∇E and apply (5.96) to these equations to give a set of forward-propagation and. backpropagation equations for the evaluation of vTH (Møller, 1993; Pearlmutter,. 1994). This corresponds to acting on the original forward-propagation and back-. propagation equations with a differential operator vT∇. Pearlmutter (1994) used the. notation R{·} to denote the operator vT∇, and we shall follow this convention. The. analysis is straightforward and makes use of the usual rules of differential calculus,. together with the result. R{w} = v.. (5.97). The technique is best illustrated with a simple example, and again we choose a. two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 5.1, with linear output units and a. sum-of-squares error function. As before, we consider the contribution to the error. function from one pattern in the data set. The required vector is then obtained as. k. j. i. j. i. j. 5.4. The Hessian Matrix. 255. usual by summing over the contributions from each of the patterns separately. For. the two-layer network, the forward-propagation equations are given by. We now act on these equations using the R{·} operator to obtain a set of forward. propagation equations in the form. aj =. wjixi. zj = h(aj). yk =. wkjzj.. vjixi. R{aj} =. R{zj} = h(aj)R{aj}. R{yk} =. wkjR{zj} +. vkjzj. (5.98). (5.99). (5.100). (5.101). (5.102). (5.103). (5.104). (5.105). (5.106). where vji is the element of the vector v that corresponds to the weight wji. Quan-. tities of the form R{zj}, R{aj} and R{yk} are to be regarded as new variables. whose values are found using the above equations.. Because we are considering a sum-of-squares error function, we have the fol-. lowing standard backpropagation expressions:. δk = yk − tk. δj = h(aj). wkjδk.. Again, we act on these equations with the R{·} operator to obtain a set of backprop-. agation equations in the form. R{δk} = R{yk}. R{δj} = h(aj)R{aj}. wkjδk. k. + h(aj). vkjδk + h(aj). k. wkjR{δk}.. k. (5.107). Finally, we have the usual equations for the first derivatives of the error. ∂E. ∂wkj. ∂E. ∂wji. = δkzj. = δjxi. (5.108). (5.109). and acting on these with the R{·} operator, we obtain expressions for the elements. of the vector vTH. = R{δk}zj + δkR{zj}. = xiR{δj}.. (5.110). (5.111). R. R. ∂E. ∂wkj. ∂E. ∂wji. 256. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. The implementation of this algorithm involves the introduction of additional. variables R{aj}, R{zj} and R{δj} for the hidden units and R{δk} and R{yk}. for the output units. For each input pattern, the values of these quantities can be. found using the above results, and the elements of vTH are then given by (5.110). and (5.111). An elegant aspect of this technique is that the equations for evaluating. vTH mirror closely those for standard forward and backward propagation, and so the. extension of existing software to compute this product is typically straightforward.. If desired, the technique can be used to evaluate the full Hessian matrix by. choosing the vector v to be given successively by a series of unit vectors of the. form (0, 0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) each of which picks out one column of the Hessian. This. leads to a formalism that is analytically equivalent to the backpropagation procedure. of Bishop (1992), as described in Section 5.4.5, though with some loss of efficiency. due to redundant calculations.. "
105,5.5,Regularization in Neural Networks,"The number of input and outputs units in a neural network is generally determined. by the dimensionality of the data set, whereas the number M of hidden units is a free. parameter that can be adjusted to give the best predictive performance. Note that M. controls the number of parameters (weights and biases) in the network, and so we. might expect that in a maximum likelihood setting there will be an optimum value. of M that gives the best generalization performance, corresponding to the optimum. balance between under-fitting and over-fitting. Figure 5.9 shows an example of the. effect of different values of M for the sinusoidal regression problem.. The generalization error, however, is not a simple function of M due to the. presence of local minima in the error function, as illustrated in Figure 5.10. Here. we see the effect of choosing multiple random initializations for the weight vector. for a range of values of M. The overall best validation set performance in this. case occurred for a particular solution having M = 8. In practice, one approach to. choosing M is in fact to plot a graph of the kind shown in Figure 5.10 and then to. choose the specific solution having the smallest validation set error.. There are, however, other ways to control the complexity of a neural network. model in order to avoid over-fitting. From our discussion of polynomial curve fitting. in Chapter 1, we see that an alternative approach is to choose a relatively large value. for M and then to control complexity by the addition of a regularization term to the. error function. The simplest regularizer is the quadratic, giving a regularized error. of the form. E(w) = E(w) + λ. 2. wTw.. (5.112). This regularizer is also known as weight decay and has been discussed at length. in Chapter 3. The effective model complexity is then determined by the choice of. the regularization coefficient λ. As we have seen previously, this regularizer can be. interpreted as the negative logarithm of a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution over. the weight vector w.. "
106,5.5.1,Consistent Gaussian priors,"One of the limitations of simple weight decay in the form (5.112) is that is. inconsistent with certain scaling properties of network mappings. To illustrate this,. consider a multilayer perceptron network having two layers of weights and linear. output units, which performs a mapping from a set of input variables {xi} to a set. of output variables {yk}. The activations of the hidden units in the first hidden layer.

NEURAL NETWORKS. take the form. while the activations of the output units are given by. zj = h. wjixi + wj0. yk =. wkjzj + wk0.. Suppose we perform a linear transformation of the input data of the form. xi = axi + b.. Exercise 5.24. Then we can arrange for the mapping performed by the network to be unchanged. by making a corresponding linear transformation of the weights and biases from the. inputs to the units in the hidden layer of the form. Similarly, a linear transformation of the output variables of the network of the form. can be achieved by making a transformation of the second-layer weights and biases. using. 1. a. wji. wji →. wj0 →. wj0 = wj0 −. wji.. yk = cyk + d. wkj →. wk0 →. wkj = cwkj. wk0 = cwk0 + d.. If we train one network using the original data and one network using data for which. the input and/or target variables are transformed by one of the above linear transfor-. mations, then consistency requires that we should obtain equivalent networks that. differ only by the linear transformation of the weights as given. Any regularizer. should be consistent with this property, otherwise it arbitrarily favours one solution. over another, equivalent one. Clearly, simple weight decay (5.112), that treats all. weights and biases on an equal footing, does not satisfy this property.. We therefore look for a regularizer which is invariant under the linear trans-. formations (5.116), (5.117), (5.119) and (5.120). These require that the regularizer. should be invariant to re-scaling of the weights and to shifts of the biases. Such a. regularizer is given by. λ1. 2. w2 + λ2. 2. w∈W1. w∈W2. w2. (5.121). where W1 denotes the set of weights in the first layer, W2 denotes the set of weights. in the second layer, and biases are excluded from the summations. This regularizer. w∈W1. k. 1. 2. 5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks. 259. will remain unchanged under the weight transformations provided the regularization. parameters are re-scaled using λ1 → a1/2λ1 and λ2 → c−1/2λ2.. The regularizer (5.121) corresponds to a prior of the form. p(w|α1, α2) ∝ exp. α1. 2. w2 −. α2. 2. w2. (5.122). w∈W2. Note that priors of this form are improper (they cannot be normalized) because the. bias parameters are unconstrained. The use of improper priors can lead to difficulties. in selecting regularization coefficients and in model comparison within the Bayesian. framework, because the corresponding evidence is zero. It is therefore common to. include separate priors for the biases (which then break shift invariance) having their. own hyperparameters. We can illustrate the effect of the resulting four hyperpa-. rameters by drawing samples from the prior and plotting the corresponding network. functions, as shown in Figure 5.11.. More generally, we can consider priors in which the weights are divided into. any number of groups Wk so that. p(w) ∝ exp. αkw2. k. where. w2. k =. w2. j .. j∈Wk. (5.123). (5.124). As a special case of this prior, if we choose the groups to correspond to the sets. of weights associated with each of the input units, and we optimize the marginal. likelihood with respect to the corresponding parameters αk, we obtain automatic. relevance determination as discussed in Section 7.2.2.. "
107,5.5.2,Early stopping,"An alternative to regularization as a way of controlling the effective complexity. of a network is the procedure of early stopping. The training of nonlinear network. models corresponds to an iterative reduction of the error function defined with re-. spect to a set of training data. For many of the optimization algorithms used for. network training, such as conjugate gradients, the error is a nonincreasing function. of the iteration index. However, the error measured with respect to independent data,. generally called a validation set, often shows a decrease at first, followed by an in-. crease as the network starts to over-fit. Training can therefore be stopped at the point. of smallest error with respect to the validation data set, as indicated in Figure 5.12,. in order to obtain a network having good generalization performance.. The behaviour of the network in this case is sometimes explained qualitatively. in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom in the network, in which this. number starts out small and then to grows during the training process, corresponding. to a steady increase in the effective complexity of the model.

The priors are governed by four hyperparameters αb. the precisions of the Gaussian distributions of the first-layer biases, first-layer weights, second-layer biases, and. 2 governs the vertical scale of functions (note. second-layer weights, respectively.

In the case of a quadratic error function, we can verify this insight, and show. that early stopping should exhibit similar behaviour to regularization using a sim-. ple weight-decay term. This can be understood from Figure 5.13, in which the axes. in weight space have been rotated to be parallel to the eigenvectors of the Hessian. matrix. If, in the absence of weight decay, the weight vector starts at the origin and. proceeds during training along a path that follows the local negative gradient vec-. tor, then the weight vector will move initially parallel to the w2 axis through a point. w and then move towards the minimum of the error func-. corresponding roughly to. tion wML. This follows from the shape of the error surface and the widely differing. w is therefore similar to weight. eigenvalues of the Hessian. Stopping at a point near. decay. The relationship between early stopping and weight decay can be made quan-. titative, thereby showing that the quantity τ η (where τ is the iteration index, and η. is the learning rate parameter) plays the role of the reciprocal of the regularization.

The effective number of parameters in the network therefore grows. during the course of training.. "
108,5.5.3,Invariances,"In many applications of pattern recognition, it is known that predictions should. be unchanged, or invariant, under one or more transformations of the input vari-. ables. For example, in the classification of objects in two-dimensional images, such. as handwritten digits, a particular object should be assigned the same classification. irrespective of its position within the image (translation invariance) or of its size. (scale invariance). Such transformations produce significant changes in the raw. data, expressed in terms of the intensities at each of the pixels in the image, and. yet should give rise to the same output from the classification system. Similarly. in speech recognition, small levels of nonlinear warping along the time axis, which. preserve temporal ordering, should not change the interpretation of the signal.. If sufficiently large numbers of training patterns are available, then an adaptive. model such as a neural network can learn the invariance, at least approximately. This. involves including within the training set a sufficiently large number of examples of. the effects of the various transformations. Thus, for translation invariance in an im-. age, the training set should include examples of objects at many different positions.. This approach may be impractical, however, if the number of training examples. is limited, or if there are several invariants (because the number of combinations of. transformations grows exponentially with the number of such transformations). We. therefore seek alternative approaches for encouraging an adaptive model to exhibit. the required invariances. These can broadly be divided into four categories:. 1. The training set is augmented using replicas of the training patterns, trans-. formed according to the desired invariances. For instance, in our digit recog-. nition example, we could make multiple copies of each example in which the. w. w2. wML. w1. e. 262. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. Figure 5.13 A schematic illustration of why. early stopping can give similar. results to weight decay in the. case of a quadratic error func-. tion. The ellipse shows a con-. tour of constant error, and wML. denotes the minimum of the er-. ror function.. If the weight vector. starts at the origin and moves ac-. cording to the local negative gra-. dient direction, then it will follow. the path shown by the curve. By. stopping training early, a weight. vector. w is found that is qual-. itatively similar to that obtained. with a simple weight-decay reg-. ularizer and training to the mini-. mum of the regularized error, as. can be seen by comparing with. Figure 3.15.. digit is shifted to a different position in each image.. 2. A regularization term is added to the error function that penalizes changes in. the model output when the input is transformed. This leads to the technique of. "
109,5.5.4,Tangent propagation,"3. Invariance is built into the pre-processing by extracting features that are invari-. ant under the required transformations. Any subsequent regression or classi-. fication system that uses such features as inputs will necessarily also respect. these invariances.. 4. The final option is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neu-. ral network (or into the definition of a kernel function in the case of techniques. such as the relevance vector machine). One way to achieve this is through the. use of local receptive fields and shared weights, as discussed in the context of. convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6.. Approach 1 is often relatively easy to implement and can be used to encourage com-. plex invariances such as those illustrated in Figure 5.14. For sequential training. algorithms, this can be done by transforming each input pattern before it is presented. to the model so that, if the patterns are being recycled, a different transformation. (drawn from an appropriate distribution) is added each time. For batch methods, a. similar effect can be achieved by replicating each data point a number of times and. transforming each copy independently. The use of such augmented data can lead to. significant improvements in generalization (Simard et al., 2003), although it can also. be computationally costly.. Approach 2 leaves the data set unchanged but modifies the error function through. the addition of a regularizer. In Section 5.5.5, we shall show that this approach is. closely related to approach 2.. 5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks. 263. Figure 5.14 Illustration of the synthetic warping of a handwritten digit. The original image is shown on the. left. On the right, the top row shows three examples of warped digits, with the corresponding displacement. fields shown on the bottom row. These displacement fields are generated by sampling random displacements. ∆x, ∆y ∈ (0, 1) at each pixel and then smoothing by convolution with Gaussians of width 0.01, 30 and 60. respectively.. One advantage of approach 3 is that it can correctly extrapolate well beyond the. range of transformations included in the training set. However, it can be difficult. to find hand-crafted features with the required invariances that do not also discard. information that can be useful for discrimination.. 5.5.4 Tangent propagation. We can use regularization to encourage models to be invariant to transformations. of the input through the technique of tangent propagation (Simard et al., 1992).. Consider the effect of a transformation on a particular input vector xn. Provided the. transformation is continuous (such as translation or rotation, but not mirror reflection. for instance), then the transformed pattern will sweep out a manifold M within the. D-dimensional input space. This is illustrated in Figure 5.15, for the case of D =. 2 for simplicity. Suppose the transformation is governed by a single parameter ξ. (which might be rotation angle for instance). Then the subspace M swept out by xn. Figure 5.15 Illustration of a two-dimensional. input space. showing the effect of a continuous transforma-. tion on a particular input vector xn. A one-. dimensional transformation, parameterized by. the continuous variable ξ, applied to xn causes. it to sweep out a one-dimensional manifold M.. Locally, the effect of the transformation can be. approximated by the tangent vector τ n.. x2. τ n. xn. M. x1. i=1. D. D. i=1. D. 264. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. will be one-dimensional, and will be parameterized by ξ. Let the vector that results. from acting on xn by this transformation be denoted by s(xn, ξ), which is defined. so that s(x, 0) = x. Then the tangent to the curve M is given by the directional. derivative τ = ∂s/∂ξ, and the tangent vector at the point xn is given by. τ n = ∂s(xn, ξ). ξ=0. (5.125). Under a transformation of the input vector, the network output vector will, in general,. change. The derivative of output k with respect to ξ is given by. ∂yk. ξ=0. ∂yk. ∂xi. ∂xi. ξ=0. Jkiτi. (5.126). where Jki is the (k, i) element of the Jacobian matrix J, as discussed in Section 5.3.4.. The result (5.126) can be used to modify the standard error function, so as to encour-. age local invariance in the neighbourhood of the data points, by the addition to the. original error function E of a regularization function Ω to give a total error function. of the form. E = E + λΩ. (5.127). where λ is a regularization coefficient and. 1. 2. n. k. ∂ynk. 2. 1. 2. ξ=0. n. k. i=1. 2. Jnkiτni. (5.128). Exercise 5.26. The regularization function will be zero when the network mapping function is in-. variant under the transformation in the neighbourhood of each pattern vector, and. the value of the parameter λ determines the balance between fitting the training data. and learning the invariance property.. In a practical implementation, the tangent vector τ n can be approximated us-. ing finite differences, by subtracting the original vector xn from the corresponding. vector after transformation using a small value of ξ, and then dividing by ξ. This is. illustrated in Figure 5.16.. The regularization function depends on the network weights through the Jaco-. bian J. A backpropagation formalism for computing the derivatives of the regu-. larizer with respect to the network weights is easily obtained by extension of the. techniques introduced in Section 5.3.. If the transformation is governed by L parameters (e.g., L = 3 for the case of. translations combined with in-plane rotations in a two-dimensional image), then the. manifold M will have dimensionality L, and the corresponding regularizer is given. by the sum of terms of the form (5.128), one for each transformation. If several. transformations are considered at the same time, and the network mapping is made. invariant to each separately, then it will be (locally) invariant to combinations of the. transformations (Simard et al., 1992).. 5.5.

110,5.5.5,Training with transformed data,"We have seen that one way to encourage invariance of a model to a set of trans-. formations is to expand the training set using transformed versions of the original. input patterns. Here we show that this approach is closely related to the technique of. tangent propagation (Bishop, 1995b; Leen, 1995).. As in Section 5.5.4, we shall consider a transformation governed by a single. parameter ξ and described by the function s(x, ξ), with s(x, 0) = x. We shall. also consider a sum-of-squares error function. The error function for untransformed. inputs can be written (in the infinite data set limit) in the form. E =. 1. 2. {y(x) − t}2p(t|x)p(x) dx dt. (5.129). as discussed in Section 1.5.5. Here we have considered a network having a single. output, in order to keep the notation uncluttered.. If we now consider an infinite. number of copies of each data point, each of which is perturbed by the transformation. 2. 266. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. in which the parameter ξ is drawn from a distribution p(ξ), then the error function. defined over this expanded data set can be written as. E =. 1. 2. {y(s(x, ξ)) − t}2p(t|x)p(x)p(ξ) dx dt dξ.. (5.130). We now assume that the distribution p(ξ) has zero mean with small variance, so that. we are only considering small transformations of the original input vectors. We can. then expand the transformation function as a Taylor series in powers of ξ to give. s(x, ξ) = s(x, 0) + ξ. s(x, ξ). + ξ2. 2. ∂2. ∂ξ2 s(x, ξ). ξ=0. + O(ξ3). ξ=0. 1. 2 ξ2τ  + O(ξ3). = x + ξτ +. where τ  denotes the second derivative of s(x, ξ) with respect to ξ evaluated at ξ = 0.. This allows us to expand the model function to give. y(s(x, ξ)) = y(x) + ξτ T∇y(x) + ξ2. 2. (τ )T ∇y(x) + τ T∇∇y(x)τ. + O(ξ3).. Substituting into the mean error function (5.130) and expanding, we then have. E =. 1. 2. {y(x) − t}2p(t|x)p(x) dx dt. + E[ξ]. {y(x) − t}τ T∇y(x)p(t|x)p(x) dx dt. + E[ξ2]. {y(x) − t}. 1. 2. (τ )T ∇y(x) + τ T∇∇y(x)τ. τ T∇y(x). p(t|x)p(x) dx dt + O(ξ3).. Because the distribution of transformations has zero mean we have E[ξ] = 0. Also,. we shall denote E[ξ2] by λ. Omitting terms of O(ξ3), the average error function then. becomes. (5.131). where E is the original sum-of-squares error, and the regularization term Ω takes the. form. E = E + λΩ. {y(x) − E[t|x]}. τ T∇y(x). 2. p(x) dx. 1. 2. (τ )T ∇y(x) + τ T∇∇y(x)τ. (5.132). in which we have performed the integration over t.. We can further simplify this regularization term as follows. In Section 1.5.5 we. saw that the function that minimizes the sum-of-squares error is given by the condi-. tional average E[t|x] of the target values t. From (5.131) we see that the regularized. error will equal the unregularized sum-of-squares plus terms which are O(ξ), and so. the network function that minimizes the total error will have the form. y(x) = E[t|x] + O(ξ).. (5.133). Thus, to leading order in ξ, the first term in the regularizer vanishes and we are left. with. 1. 2. τ T∇y(x). 2. p(x) dx. (5.134). which is equivalent to the tangent propagation regularizer (5.128).. If we consider the special case in which the transformation of the inputs simply. consists of the addition of random noise, so that x → x + ξ, then the regularizer. takes the form. (5.135). 1. 2. ∇y(x)2 p(x) dx. which is known as Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Bishop,. 1995b). Derivatives of this regularizer with respect to the network weights can be. found using an extended backpropagation algorithm (Bishop, 1993). We see that, for. small noise amplitudes, Tikhonov regularization is related to the addition of random. noise to the inputs, which has been shown to improve generalization in appropriate. circumstances (Sietsma and Dow, 1991).. "
111,5.5.6,Convolutional networks,"Another approach to creating models that are invariant to certain transformation. of the inputs is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neural net-. work. This is the basis for the convolutional neural network (Le Cun et al., 1989;. LeCun et al., 1998), which has been widely applied to image data.. Consider the specific task of recognizing handwritten digits. Each input image. comprises a set of pixel intensity values, and the desired output is a posterior proba-. bility distribution over the ten digit classes. We know that the identity of the digit is. invariant under translations and scaling as well as (small) rotations. Furthermore, the. network must also exhibit invariance to more subtle transformations such as elastic. deformations of the kind illustrated in Figure 5.14. One simple approach would be to. treat the image as the input to a fully connected network, such as the kind shown in. Figure 5.1. Given a sufficiently large training set, such a network could in principle. yield a good solution to this problem and would learn the appropriate invariances by. example.. However, this approach ignores a key property of images, which is that nearby. pixels are more strongly correlated than more distant pixels. Many of the modern. approaches to computer vision exploit this property by extracting local features that. depend only on small subregions of the image. Information from such features can. then be merged in later stages of processing in order to detect higher-order features. 5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks. 267. Exercise 5.27. 268. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. Input image. Convolutional layer. Sub-sampling. layer. Figure 5.17 Diagram illustrating part of a convolutional neural network, showing a layer of convolu-. tional units followed by a layer of subsampling units. Several successive pairs of such. layers may be used.. and ultimately to yield information about the image as whole. Also, local features. that are useful in one region of the image are likely to be useful in other regions of. the image, for instance if the object of interest is translated.. These notions are incorporated into convolutional neural networks through three. mechanisms: (i) local receptive fields, (ii) weight sharing, and (iii) subsampling. The. structure of a convolutional network is illustrated in Figure 5.17. In the convolutional. layer the units are organized into planes, each of which is called a feature map. Units. in a feature map each take inputs only from a small subregion of the image, and all. of the units in a feature map are constrained to share the same weight values. For. instance, a feature map might consist of 100 units arranged in a 10 × 10 grid, with. each unit taking inputs from a 5×5 pixel patch of the image. The whole feature map. therefore has 25 adjustable weight parameters plus one adjustable bias parameter.. Input values from a patch are linearly combined using the weights and the bias, and. the result transformed by a sigmoidal nonlinearity using (5.1). If we think of the units. as feature detectors, then all of the units in a feature map detect the same pattern but. at different locations in the input image. Due to the weight sharing, the evaluation. of the activations of these units is equivalent to a convolution of the image pixel. intensities with a ‘kernel’ comprising the weight parameters. If the input image is. shifted, the activations of the feature map will be shifted by the same amount but will. otherwise be unchanged. This provides the basis for the (approximate) invariance of. 5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks. 269. the network outputs to translations and distortions of the input image. Because we. will typically need to detect multiple features in order to build an effective model,. there will generally be multiple feature maps in the convolutional layer, each having. its own set of weight and bias parameters.. The outputs of the convolutional units form the inputs to the subsampling layer. of the network. For each feature map in the convolutional layer, there is a plane of. units in the subsampling layer and each unit takes inputs from a small receptive field. in the corresponding feature map of the convolutional layer. These units perform. subsampling. For instance, each subsampling unit might take inputs from a 2 × 2. unit region in the corresponding feature map and would compute the average of. those inputs, multiplied by an adaptive weight with the addition of an adaptive bias. parameter, and then transformed using a sigmoidal nonlinear activation function.. The receptive fields are chosen to be contiguous and nonoverlapping so that there. are half the number of rows and columns in the subsampling layer compared with. the convolutional layer. In this way, the response of a unit in the subsampling layer. will be relatively insensitive to small shifts of the image in the corresponding regions. of the input space.. In a practical architecture, there may be several pairs of convolutional and sub-. sampling layers. At each stage there is a larger degree of invariance to input trans-. formations compared to the previous layer. There may be several feature maps in a. given convolutional layer for each plane of units in the previous subsampling layer,. so that the gradual reduction in spatial resolution is then compensated by an increas-. ing number of features. The final layer of the network would typically be a fully. connected, fully adaptive layer, with a softmax output nonlinearity in the case of. multiclass classification.. The whole network can be trained by error minimization using backpropagation. to evaluate the gradient of the error function. This involves a slight modification. of the usual backpropagation algorithm to ensure that the shared-weight constraints. are satisfied. Due to the use of local receptive fields, the number of weights in. the network is smaller than if the network were fully connected. Furthermore, the. number of independent parameters to be learned from the data is much smaller still,. due to the substantial numbers of constraints on the weights.. "
112,5.5.7,Soft weight sharing,"One way to reduce the effective complexity of a network with a large number. of weights is to constrain weights within certain groups to be equal. This is the. technique of weight sharing that was discussed in Section 5.5.6 as a way of building. translation invariance into networks used for image interpretation. It is only appli-. cable, however, to particular problems in which the form of the constraints can be. specified in advance. Here we consider a form of soft weight sharing (Nowlan and. Hinton, 1992) in which the hard constraint of equal weights is replaced by a form. of regularization in which groups of weights are encouraged to have similar values.. Furthermore, the division of weights into groups, the mean weight value for each. group, and the spread of values within the groups are all determined as part of the. learning process.. Exercise 5.28. j=1. j=1. M. M. i. 270. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. Section 2.3.9. Exercise 5.29. Recall that the simple weight decay regularizer, given in (5.112), can be viewed. as the negative log of a Gaussian prior distribution over the weights. We can encour-. age the weight values to form several groups, rather than just one group, by consid-. ering instead a probability distribution that is a mixture of Gaussians. The centres. and variances of the Gaussian components, as well as the mixing coefficients, will be. considered as adjustable parameters to be determined as part of the learning process.. Thus, we have a probability density of the form. where. p(w) =. p(wi). p(wi) =. πjN (wi|µj, σ2. j ). (5.136). (5.137). and πj are the mixing coefficients. Taking the negative logarithm then leads to a. regularization function of the form. Ω(w) = −. ln. i. πjN (wi|µj, σ2. j ). The total error function is then given by. E(w) = E(w) + λΩ(w). (5.138). (5.139). where λ is the regularization coefficient. This error is minimized both with respect. to the weights wi and with respect to the parameters {πj, µj, σj} of the mixture. model. If the weights were constant, then the parameters of the mixture model could. be determined by using the EM algorithm discussed in Chapter 9. However, the dis-. tribution of weights is itself evolving during the learning process, and so to avoid nu-. merical instability, a joint optimization is performed simultaneously over the weights. and the mixture-model parameters. This can be done using a standard optimization. algorithm such as conjugate gradients or quasi-Newton methods.. In order to minimize the total error function, it is necessary to be able to evaluate. its derivatives with respect to the various adjustable parameters. To do this it is con-. venient to regard the {πj} as prior probabilities and to introduce the corresponding. posterior probabilities which, following (2.192), are given by Bayes’ theorem in the. form. γj(w) =. πjN (w|µj, σ2. j ). k) .. k πkN (w|µk, σ2.

The effect of the regularization term is therefore to pull each weight towards the. centre of the jth Gaussian, with a force proportional to the posterior probability of. that Gaussian for the given weight. This is precisely the kind of effect that we are. seeking.. Derivatives of the error with respect to the centres of the Gaussians are also. γj(wi). (µi − wj). σ2. j. (5.142). which has a simple intuitive interpretation, because it pushes µj towards an aver-. age of the weight values, weighted by the posterior probabilities that the respective. weight parameters were generated by component j. Similarly, the derivatives with. respect to the variances are given by. γj(wi). 1. σj −. (wi − µj)2. σ3. j. (5.143). which drives σj towards the weighted average of the squared deviations of the weights. around the corresponding centre µj, where the weighting coefficients are again given. by the posterior probability that each weight is generated by component j. Note that. in a practical implementation, new variables ηj defined by. j = exp(ηj). σ2. (5.144). are introduced, and the minimization is performed with respect to the ηj. This en-. sures that the parameters σj remain positive. It also has the effect of discouraging. pathological solutions in which one or more of the σj goes to zero, corresponding. to a Gaussian component collapsing onto one of the weight parameter values. Such. solutions are discussed in more detail in the context of Gaussian mixture models in. Section 9.2.1.. For the derivatives with respect to the mixing coefficients πj, we need to take. πj = 1,. 0 � πi � 1. (5.145). j. which follow from the interpretation of the πj as prior probabilities. This can be. done by expressing the mixing coefficients in terms of a set of auxiliary variables. {ηj} using the softmax function given by. πj =. exp(ηj). M. k=1 exp(ηk). (5.146). Exercise 5.32. The derivatives of the regularized error function with respect to the {ηj} then take. the form. 272. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. Figure 5.18 The left figure shows a two-link robot arm,. in which the Cartesian coordinates (x1, x2) of the end ef-. fector are determined uniquely by the two joint angles θ1. and θ2 and the (fixed) lengths L1 and L2 of the arms.

113,5.6,Mixture Density Networks,"The goal of supervised learning is to model a conditional distribution p(t|x), which. for many simple regression problems is chosen to be Gaussian. However, practical. machine learning problems can often have significantly non-Gaussian distributions.. These can arise, for example, with inverse problems in which the distribution can be. multimodal, in which case the Gaussian assumption can lead to very poor predic-. tions.. As a simple example of an inverse problem, consider the kinematics of a robot. arm, as illustrated in Figure 5.18. The forward problem involves finding the end ef-. fector position given the joint angles and has a unique solution. However, in practice. we wish to move the end effector of the robot to a specific position, and to do this we. must set appropriate joint angles. We therefore need to solve the inverse problem,. which has two solutions as seen in Figure 5.18.. Forward problems often corresponds to causality in a physical system and gen-. erally have a unique solution. For instance, a specific pattern of symptoms in the. human body may be caused by the presence of a particular disease. In pattern recog-. nition, however, we typically have to solve an inverse problem, such as trying to. predict the presence of a disease given a set of symptoms. If the forward problem. involves a many-to-one mapping, then the inverse problem will have multiple solu-. tions. For instance, several different diseases may result in the same symptoms.. In the robotics example, the kinematics is defined by geometrical equations, and. the multimodality is readily apparent. However, in many machine learning problems. the presence of multimodality, particularly in problems involving spaces of high di-. mensionality, can be less obvious. For tutorial purposes, however, we shall consider. a simple toy problem for which we can easily visualize the multimodality. Data for. this problem is generated by sampling a variable x uniformly over the interval (0, 1),. to give a set of values {xn}, and the corresponding target values tn are obtained. (x1, x2). (x1, x2). elbow. up. θ1. elbow. down. (5.147). K. 1. 5.6. Mixture Density Networks. Figure 5.19 On the left is the data. set for a simple ‘forward problem’ in. which the red curve shows the result. of fitting a two-layer neural network. by minimizing the sum-of-squares. error function. The corresponding. inverse problem, shown on the right,. is obtained by exchanging the roles. of x and t. Here the same net-. work trained again by minimizing the. sum-of-squares error function gives. a very poor fit to the data due to the. multimodality of the data set.. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 273. 1. by computing the function xn + 0.3 sin(2πxn) and then adding uniform noise over. the interval (−0.1, 0.1). The inverse problem is then obtained by keeping the same. data points but exchanging the roles of x and t. Figure 5.19 shows the data sets for. the forward and inverse problems, along with the results of fitting two-layer neural. networks having 6 hidden units and a single linear output unit by minimizing a sum-. of-squares error function. Least squares corresponds to maximum likelihood under. a Gaussian assumption. We see that this leads to a very poor model for the highly. non-Gaussian inverse problem.. We therefore seek a general framework for modelling conditional probability. distributions. This can be achieved by using a mixture model for p(t|x) in which. both the mixing coefficients as well as the component densities are flexible functions. of the input vector x, giving rise to the mixture density network. For any given value. of x, the mixture model provides a general formalism for modelling an arbitrary. conditional density function p(t|x). Provided we consider a sufficiently flexible. network, we then have a framework for approximating arbitrary conditional distri-. butions.. Here we shall develop the model explicitly for Gaussian components, so that. p(t|x) =. k=1. πk(x)N. t|µk(x), σ2. k(x). (5.148). This is an example of a heteroscedastic model since the noise variance on the data. is a function of the input vector x. Instead of Gaussians, we can use other distribu-. tions for the components, such as Bernoulli distributions if the target variables are. binary rather than continuous. We have also specialized to the case of isotropic co-. variances for the components, although the mixture density network can readily be. extended to allow for general covariance matrices by representing the covariances. using a Cholesky factorization (Williams, 1996). Even with isotropic components,. the conditional distribution p(t|x) does not assume factorization with respect to the. components of t (in contrast to the standard sum-of-squares regression model) as a. consequence of the mixture distribution.. We now take the various parameters of the mixture model, namely the mixing. k(x), to be governed by. coefficients πk(x), the means µk(x), and the variances σ2. K. 274. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. xD. x1. θM. θ1. p(t|x). t. Figure 5.20 The mixturedensitynetwork can represent general conditional probability densities p(t|x). by considering a parametric mixture model for the distribution of t whose parameters are. determined by the outputs of a neural network that takes x as its input vector.. the outputs of a conventional neural network that takes x as its input. The structure. of this mixture density network is illustrated in Figure 5.20. The mixture density. network is closely related to the mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3. The. principle difference is that in the mixture density network the same function is used. to predict the parameters of all of the component densities as well as the mixing co-. efficients, and so the nonlinear hidden units are shared amongst the input-dependent. functions.. The neural network in Figure 5.20 can, for example, be a two-layer network. having sigmoidal (‘tanh’) hidden units. If there are L components in the mixture. model (5.148), and if t has K components, then the network will have L output unit. k that determine the mixing coefficients πk(x), K outputs. activations denoted by aπ. k that determine the kernel widths σk(x), and L × K outputs denoted. denoted by aσ. by aµ. kj that determine the components µkj(x) of the kernel centres µk(x). The total. number of network outputs is given by (K + 2)L, as compared with the usual K. outputs for a network, which simply predicts the conditional means of the target. variables.. The mixing coefficients must satisfy the constraints. πk(x) = 1,. k=1. 0 � πk(x) � 1. (5.149). which can be achieved using a set of softmax outputs. πk(x) =. exp(aπ. k). K. l=1 exp(aπ. l ). (5.150). Similarly, the variances must satisfy σ2. of the exponentials of the corresponding network activations using. k(x) � 0 and so can be represented in terms. Finally, because the means µk(x) have real components, they can be represented. σk(x) = exp(aσ. k).. (5.151). N. k. 5.6. Mixture Density Networks. directly by the network output activations. µkj(x) = aµ. kj.. The adaptive parameters of the mixture density network comprise the vector w. of weights and biases in the neural network, that can be set by maximum likelihood,. or equivalently by minimizing an error function defined to be the negative logarithm. of the likelihood. For independent data, this error function takes the form. E(w) = −. ln. n=1. k=1. πk(xn, w)N. tn|µk(xn, w), σ2. k(xn, w). (5.153). where we have made the dependencies on w explicit.. In order to minimize the error function, we need to calculate the derivatives of. the error E(w) with respect to the components of w. These can be evaluated by. using the standard backpropagation procedure, provided we obtain suitable expres-. sions for the derivatives of the error with respect to the output-unit activations. These. represent error signals δ for each pattern and for each output unit, and can be back-. propagated to the hidden units and the error function derivatives evaluated in the. usual way. Because the error function (5.153) is composed of a sum of terms, one. for each training data point, we can consider the derivatives for a particular pattern. n and then find the derivatives of E by summing over all patterns.. Because we are dealing with mixture distributions, it is convenient to view the. mixing coefficients πk(x) as x-dependent prior probabilities and to introduce the. corresponding posterior probabilities given by. where Nnk denotes N (tn|µk(xn), σ2. ing coefficients are given by. k(xn))..

We illustrate the use of a mixture density network by returning to the toy ex-. ample of an inverse problem shown in Figure 5.19. Plots of the mixing coeffi-. cients πk(x), the means µk(x), and the conditional density contours corresponding. to p(t|x), are shown in Figure 5.21. The outputs of the neural network, and hence the. parameters in the mixture model, are necessarily continuous single-valued functions. of the input variables. However, we see from Figure 5.21(c) that the model is able to. produce a conditional density that is unimodal for some values of x and trimodal for. other values by modulating the amplitudes of the mixing components πk(x).. Once a mixture density network has been trained, it can predict the conditional. density function of the target data for any given value of the input vector. This. conditional density represents a complete description of the generator of the data, so. far as the problem of predicting the value of the output vector is concerned. From. this density function we can calculate more specific quantities that may be of interest. in different applications. One of the simplest of these is the mean, corresponding to. the conditional average of the target data, and is given by. E [t|x] =. tp(t|x) dt =. k=1. πk(x)µk(x). (5.158). k=1. ⎧⎨⎩σ2. '''''µk(x) −.

Because a standard network trained by least squares. is approximating the conditional mean, we see that a mixture density network can. reproduce the conventional least-squares result as a special case. Of course, as we. have already noted, for a multimodal distribution the conditional mean is of limited. value.. We can similarly evaluate the variance of the density function about the condi-.

This is more general than the corresponding. least-squares result because the variance is a function of x.. We have seen that for multimodal distributions, the conditional mean can give. a poor representation of the data. For instance, in controlling the simple robot arm. shown in Figure 5.18, we need to pick one of the two possible joint angle settings. in order to achieve the desired end-effector location, whereas the average of the two. solutions is not itself a solution.. In such cases, the conditional mode may be of. more value. Because the conditional mode for the mixture density network does not. have a simple analytical solution, this would require numerical iteration. A simple. alternative is to take the mean of the most probable component (i.e., the one with the. largest mixing coefficient) at each value of x. This is shown for the toy data set in. Figure 5.21(d).. 5.7. Bayesian Neural Networks. So far, our discussion of neural networks has focussed on the use of maximum like-. lihood to determine the network parameters (weights and biases). Regularized max-. imum likelihood can be interpreted as a MAP (maximum posterior) approach in. which the regularizer can be viewed as the logarithm of a prior parameter distribu-. tion. However, in a Bayesian treatment we need to marginalize over the distribution. of parameters in order to make predictions.. In Section 3.3, we developed a Bayesian solution for a simple linear regression. model under the assumption of Gaussian noise. We saw that the posterior distribu-. tion, which is Gaussian, could be evaluated exactly and that the predictive distribu-. tion could also be found in closed form. In the case of a multilayered network, the. highly nonlinear dependence of the network function on the parameter values means. that an exact Bayesian treatment can no longer be found. In fact, the log of the pos-. terior distribution will be nonconvex, corresponding to the multiple local minima in. the error function.. The technique of variational inference, to be discussed in Chapter 10, has been. applied to Bayesian neural networks using a factorized Gaussian approximation. N. 278. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. to the posterior distribution (Hinton and van Camp, 1993) and also using a full-. covariance Gaussian (Barber and Bishop, 1998a; Barber and Bishop, 1998b). The. most complete treatment, however, has been based on the Laplace approximation. (MacKay, 1992c; MacKay, 1992b) and forms the basis for the discussion given here.. We will approximate the posterior distribution by a Gaussian, centred at a mode of. the true posterior. Furthermore, we shall assume that the covariance of this Gaus-. sian is small so that the network function is approximately linear with respect to the. parameters over the region of parameter space for which the posterior probability is. significantly nonzero. With these two approximations, we will obtain models that. are analogous to the linear regression and classification models discussed in earlier. chapters and so we can exploit the results obtained there. We can then make use of. the evidence framework to provide point estimates for the hyperparameters and to. compare alternative models (for example, networks having different numbers of hid-. den units). To start with, we shall discuss the regression case and then later consider. the modifications needed for solving classification tasks.. "
115,5.7.1,Posterior parameter distribution,"Consider the problem of predicting a single continuous target variable t from. a vector x of inputs (the extension to multiple targets is straightforward). We shall. suppose that the conditional distribution p(t|x) is Gaussian, with an x-dependent. mean given by the output of a neural network model y(x, w), and with precision. (inverse variance) β. p(t|x, w, β) = N (t|y(x, w), β−1).. (5.161). Similarly, we shall choose a prior distribution over the weights w that is Gaussian of. the form. (5.162). For an i.i.d. data set of N observations x1, . . . , xN , with a corresponding set of target. values D = {t1, . . . , tN}, the likelihood function is given by. p(w|α) = N (w|0, α−1I).. p(D|w, β) =. n=1. N (tn|y(xn, w), β−1). and so the resulting posterior distribution is then. p(w|D, α, β) ∝ p(w|α)p(D|w, β).. (5.163). (5.164). which, as a consequence of the nonlinear dependence of y(x, w) on w, will be non-. Gaussian.. We can find a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution by using the. Laplace approximation. To do this, we must first find a (local) maximum of the. posterior, and this must be done using iterative numerical optimization. As usual, it. is convenient to maximize the logarithm of the posterior, which can be written in the. n=1. N. Exercise 5.38. We can therefore make use of the general result (2.115) for the marginal p(t) to give. p(t|x, w, β)  N. t|y(x, wMAP) + gT(w − wMAP), β−1. (5.171). p(t|x,D, α, β) = N. t|y(x, wMAP), σ2(x).

Assuming for. the moment that α and β are fixed, we can find a maximum of the posterior, which. we denote wMAP, by standard nonlinear optimization algorithms such as conjugate. gradients, using error backpropagation to evaluate the required derivatives.. Having found a mode wMAP, we can then build a local Gaussian approximation. by evaluating the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log posterior distribu-. tion. From (5.165), this is given by. A = −∇∇ ln p(w|D, α, β) = αI + βH. (5.166). where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of-. squares error function with respect to the components of w. Algorithms for comput-. ing and approximating the Hessian were discussed in Section 5.4. The corresponding. Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given from (4.134) by. q(w|D) = N (w|wMAP, A−1).. Similarly, the predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing with respect. to this posterior distribution. p(t|x,D) =. p(t|x, w)q(w|D) dw.. However, even with the Gaussian approximation to the posterior, this integration is. still analytically intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function y(x, w). as a function of w. To make progress, we now assume that the posterior distribution. has small variance compared with the characteristic scales of w over which y(x, w). is varying. This allows us to make a Taylor series expansion of the network function. around wMAP and retain only the linear terms. y(x, w)  y(x, wMAP) + gT(w − wMAP). (5.169). where we have defined. (5.170). With this approximation, we now have a linear-Gaussian model with a Gaussian. distribution for p(w) and a Gaussian for p(t|w) whose mean is a linear function of. w of the form. g = ∇wy(x, w)|w=wMAP .. 280. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS. N. n=1. Exercise 5.39. This is easily evaluated by making use of the Laplace approximation result (4.135).. Taking logarithms then gives. p(D|α, β) =. p(D|w, β)p(w|α) dw.. (5.174). where the input-dependent variance is given by. σ2(x) = β−1 + gTA−1g.. (5.173). We see that the predictive distribution p(t|x,D) is a Gaussian whose mean is given. by the network function y(x, wMAP) with the parameter set to their MAP value. The. variance has two terms, the first of which arises from the intrinsic noise on the target. variable, whereas the second is an x-dependent term that expresses the uncertainty. in the interpolant due to the uncertainty in the model parameters w. This should. be compared with the corresponding predictive distribution for the linear regression. model, given by (3.58) and (3.59).. "
116,5.7.2,Hyperparameter optimization,"So far, we have assumed that the hyperparameters α and β are fixed and known.. We can make use of the evidence framework, discussed in Section 3.5, together with. the Gaussian approximation to the posterior obtained using the Laplace approxima-. tion, to obtain a practical procedure for choosing the values of such hyperparameters.. The marginal likelihood, or evidence, for the hyperparameters is obtained by. integrating over the network weights. ln p(D|α, β)  −E(wMAP) −. where W is the total number of parameters in w, and the regularized error function. is defined by. ln(2π) (5.175). ln β −. ln|A| + W. 2. ln α + N. 2. N. 2. 1. 2. E(wMAP) = β. 2. {y(xn, wMAP) − tn}2 + α. 2. wT. MAPwMAP.. (5.176). We see that this takes the same form as the corresponding result (3.86) for the linear. regression model.. In the evidence framework, we make point estimates for α and β by maximizing. ln p(D|α, β). Consider first the maximization with respect to α, which can be done. by analogy with the linear regression case discussed in Section 3.5.2. We first define. the eigenvalue equation. (5.177). where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of-. squares error function, evaluated at w = wMAP. By analogy with (3.92), we obtain. βHui = λiui. wT. MAPwMAP.

Note that this result was exact for the linear regression case. For the nonlinear neural. network, however, it ignores the fact that changes in α will cause changes in the. Hessian H, which in turn will change the eigenvalues. We have therefore implicitly. ignored terms involving the derivatives of λi with respect to α.. Similarly, from (3.95) we see that maximizing the evidence with respect to β. gives the re-estimation formula. 1. N. 1. N − γ. n=1. {y(xn, wMAP) − tn}2.. (5.180). As with the linear model, we need to alternate between re-estimation of the hyper-. parameters α and β and updating of the posterior distribution. The situation with. a neural network model is more complex, however, due to the multimodality of the. posterior distribution. As a consequence, the solution for wMAP found by maximiz-. ing the log posterior will depend on the initialization of w. Solutions that differ only. as a consequence of the interchange and sign reversal symmetries in the hidden units. are identical so far as predictions are concerned, and it is irrelevant which of the. equivalent solutions is found. However, there may be inequivalent solutions as well,. and these will generally yield different values for the optimized hyperparameters.. In order to compare different models, for example neural networks having differ-. ent numbers of hidden units, we need to evaluate the model evidence p(D). This can. be approximated by taking (5.175) and substituting the values of α and β obtained. from the iterative optimization of these hyperparameters. A more careful evaluation. is obtained by marginalizing over α and β, again by making a Gaussian approxima-. tion (MacKay, 1992c; Bishop, 1995a). In either case, it is necessary to evaluate the. determinant |A| of the Hessian matrix. This can be problematic in practice because. the determinant, unlike the trace, is sensitive to the small eigenvalues that are often. difficult to determine accurately.. The Laplace approximation is based on a local quadratic expansion around a. mode of the posterior distribution over weights. We have seen in Section 5.1.1 that. any given mode in a two-layer network is a member of a set of M!2M equivalent. modes that differ by interchange and sign-change symmetries, where M is the num-. ber of hidden units. When comparing networks having different numbers of hid-. den units, this can be taken into account by multiplying the evidence by a factor of. M!2M .. "
117,5.7.3,Bayesian neural networks for classification,"So far, we have used the Laplace approximation to develop a Bayesian treat-. ment of neural network regression models. We now discuss the modifications to. N. this framework that arise when it is applied to classification. Here we shall con-. sider a network having a single logistic sigmoid output corresponding to a two-class. classification problem. The extension to networks with multiclass softmax outputs. is straightforward. We shall build extensively on the analogous results for linear. classification models discussed in Section 4.5, and so we encourage the reader to. familiarize themselves with that material before studying this section.. The log likelihood function for this model is given by. ln p(D|w) =. = 1N {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)}. n. (5.181). where tn ∈ {0, 1} are the target values, and yn ≡ y(xn, w). Note that there is no. hyperparameter β, because the data points are assumed to be correctly labelled. As. before, the prior is taken to be an isotropic Gaussian of the form (5.162).. The first stage in applying the Laplace framework to this model is to initialize. the hyperparameter α, and then to determine the parameter vector w by maximizing. the log posterior distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the regularized error. function. E(w) = − ln p(D|w) + α. 2. wTw. (5.182). and can be achieved using error backpropagation combined with standard optimiza-. tion algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.3.. Having found a solution wMAP for the weight vector, the next step is to eval-. uate the Hessian matrix H comprising the second derivatives of the negative log. likelihood function. This can be done, for instance, using the exact method of Sec-. tion 5.4.5, or using the outer product approximation given by (5.85). The second. derivatives of the negative log posterior can again be written in the form (5.166), and. the Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given by (5.167).. To optimize the hyperparameter α, we again maximize the marginal likelihood,. which is easily shown to take the form. ln p(D|α)  −E(wMAP) −. 1. 2. ln|A| + W. 2. ln α + const. (5.183). where the regularized error function is defined by. E(wMAP) = −. n=1. {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)} + α. 2. wT. MAPwMAP (5.184). in which yn ≡ y(xn, wMAP). Maximizing this evidence function with respect to α. again leads to the re-estimation equation given by (5.178).. The use of the evidence procedure to determine α is illustrated in Figure 5.22. for the synthetic two-dimensional data discussed in Appendix A.. Finally, we need the predictive distribution, which is defined by (5.168). Again,. this integration is intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function. The. 282. 5. NEURAL NETWORKS.

(5.185). We can improve on this, however, by taking account of the variance of the posterior. distribution. In this case, a linear approximation for the network outputs, as was used. in the case of regression, would be inappropriate due to the logistic sigmoid output-. unit activation function that constrains the output to lie in the range (0, 1). Instead,. we make a linear approximation for the output unit activation in the form. a(x, w)  aMAP(x) + bT(w − wMAP). (5.186). where aMAP(x) = a(x, wMAP), and the vector b ≡ ∇a(x, wMAP) can be found by. backpropagation.. Because we now have a Gaussian approximation for the posterior distribution. over w, and a model for a that is a linear function of w, we can now appeal to the. results of Section 4.5.2. The distribution of output unit activation values, induced by. the distribution over network weights, is given by. p(a|x,D) =. a − aMAP(x) − bT(x)(w − wMAP). q(w|D) dw (5.187). where q(w|D) is the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution given by. (5.167). From Section 4.5.2, we see that this distribution is Gaussian with mean. aMAP ≡ a(x, wMAP), and variance. a(x) = bT(x)A−1b(x).. σ2. (5.188).

On the right is the corresponding result obtained using (5.190). Note. that the effect of marginalization is to spread out the contours and to make the predictions less confident, so. that at each input point x, the posterior probabilities are shifted towards 0.5, while the y = 0.5 contour itself is. unaffected..

118,6,Kernel Methods,"In Chapters 3 and 4, we considered linear parametric models for regression and. classification in which the form of the mapping y(x, w) from input x to output y. is governed by a vector w of adaptive parameters. During the learning phase, a. set of training data is used either to obtain a point estimate of the parameter vector. or to determine a posterior distribution over this vector. The training data is then. discarded, and predictions for new inputs are based purely on the learned parameter. vector w. This approach is also used in nonlinear parametric models such as neural. networks.. However, there is a class of pattern recognition techniques, in which the training. data points, or a subset of them, are kept and used also during the prediction phase.. For instance, the Parzen probability density model comprised a linear combination. of ‘kernel’ functions each one centred on one of the training data points. Similarly,. in Section 2.5.2 we introduced a simple technique for classification called nearest. neighbours, which involved assigning to each new test vector the same label as the. Chapter 5. Section 2.5.1. 291. 292. 6. KERNEL METHODS. closest example from the training set. These are examples of memory-based methods. that involve storing the entire training set in order to make predictions for future data. points. They typically require a metric to be defined that measures the similarity of. any two vectors in input space, and are generally fast to ‘train’ but slow at making. predictions for test data points.. Many linear parametric models can be re-cast into an equivalent ‘dual represen-. tation’ in which the predictions are also based on linear combinations of a kernel. function evaluated at the training data points. As we shall see, for models which are. based on a fixed nonlinear feature space mapping φ(x), the kernel function is given. by the relation. k(x, x) = φ(x)Tφ(x).. (6.1). From this definition, we see that the kernel is a symmetric function of its arguments. so that k(x, x) = k(x, x). The kernel concept was introduced into the field of pat-. tern recognition by Aizerman et al. (1964) in the context of the method of potential. functions, so-called because of an analogy with electrostatics. Although neglected. for many years, it was re-introduced into machine learning in the context of large-. margin classifiers by Boser et al.. (1992) giving rise to the technique of support. vector machines. Since then, there has been considerable interest in this topic, both. in terms of theory and applications. One of the most significant developments has. been the extension of kernels to handle symbolic objects, thereby greatly expanding. the range of problems that can be addressed.. The simplest example of a kernel function is obtained by considering the identity. mapping for the feature space in (6.1) so that φ(x) = x, in which case k(x, x) =. xTx. We shall refer to this as the linear kernel.. The concept of a kernel formulated as an inner product in a feature space allows. us to build interesting extensions of many well-known algorithms by making use of. the kernel trick, also known as kernel substitution. The general idea is that, if we have. an algorithm formulated in such a way that the input vector x enters only in the form. of scalar products, then we can replace that scalar product with some other choice of. kernel. For instance, the technique of kernel substitution can be applied to principal. component analysis in order to develop a nonlinear variant of PCA (Sch¨olkopf et al.,. 1998). Other examples of kernel substitution include nearest-neighbour classifiers. and the kernel Fisher discriminant (Mika et al., 1999; Roth and Steinhage, 2000;. Baudat and Anouar, 2000).. There are numerous forms of kernel functions in common use, and we shall en-. counter several examples in this chapter. Many have the property of being a function. only of the difference between the arguments, so that k(x, x) = k(x − x), which. are known as stationary kernels because they are invariant to translations in input. space. A further specialization involves homogeneous kernels, also known as ra-. dial basis functions, which depend only on the magnitude of the distance (typically. Euclidean) between the arguments so that k(x, x) = k(x − x).. brich (2002), and Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004)..

119,6.1,Dual Representations,"293. 6.1. Dual Representations. Many linear models for regression and classification can be reformulated in terms of. a dual representation in which the kernel function arises naturally. This concept will. play an important role when we consider support vector machines in the next chapter.. Here we consider a linear regression model whose parameters are determined by. minimizing a regularized sum-of-squares error function given by. J(w) =. 1. 2. wTφ(xn) − tn. 2 + λ. 2. wTw. (6.2). where λ � 0. If we set the gradient of J(w) with respect to w equal to zero, we see. that the solution for w takes the form of a linear combination of the vectors φ(xn),. with coefficients that are functions of w, of the form. w = −. 1. wTφ(xn) − tn. φ(xn) =. anφ(xn) = ΦTa. (6.3). where Φ is the design matrix, whose nth row is given by φ(xn)T. Here the vector. a = (a1, . . . , aN )T, and we have defined. an = −. 1. wTφ(xn) − tn. (6.4). Instead of working with the parameter vector w, we can now reformulate the least-. squares algorithm in terms of the parameter vector a, giving rise to a dual represen-. tation. If we substitute w = ΦTa into J(w), we obtain. J(a) =. 1. 2. aTΦΦTΦΦTa − aTΦΦTt +. 1. 2. tTt + λ. 2. aTΦΦTa. (6.5). where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. We now define the Gram matrix K = ΦΦT, which is an. N × N symmetric matrix with elements. Knm = φ(xn)Tφ(xm) = k(xn, xm). (6.6). where we have introduced the kernel function k(x, x) defined by (6.1). In terms of. the Gram matrix, the sum-of-squares error function can be written as. J(a) =. 1. 2. aTKKa − aTKt +. 1. 2. tTt + λ. 2. aTKa.. (6.7). Setting the gradient of J(a) with respect to a to zero, we obtain the following solu-. tion. a = (K + λIN )−1 t.. (6.8). If we substitute this back into the linear regression model, we obtain the following. prediction for a new input x. y(x) = wTφ(x) = aTΦφ(x) = k(x)T (K + λIN )−1 t. (6.9). where we have defined the vector k(x) with elements kn(x) = k(xn, x). Thus we. see that the dual formulation allows the solution to the least-squares problem to be. expressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x). This is known as a dual. formulation because, by noting that the solution for a can be expressed as a linear. combination of the elements of φ(x), we recover the original formulation in terms of. the parameter vector w. Note that the prediction at x is given by a linear combination. of the target values from the training set. In fact, we have already obtained this result,. using a slightly different notation, in Section 3.3.3.. In the dual formulation, we determine the parameter vector a by inverting an. N × N matrix, whereas in the original parameter space formulation we had to invert. an M × M matrix in order to determine w. Because N is typically much larger. than M, the dual formulation does not seem to be particularly useful. However, the. advantage of the dual formulation, as we shall see, is that it is expressed entirely in. terms of the kernel function k(x, x). We can therefore work directly in terms of. kernels and avoid the explicit introduction of the feature vector φ(x), which allows. us implicitly to use feature spaces of high, even infinite, dimensionality.. The existence of a dual representation based on the Gram matrix is a property of. many linear models, including the perceptron. In Section 6.4, we will develop a dual-. ity between probabilistic linear models for regression and the technique of Gaussian. processes. Duality will also play an important role when we discuss support vector. machines in Chapter 7.. Exercise 6.1. Exercise 6.2. i=1. M. 294. 6. KERNEL METHODS. "
120,6.2,Constructing Kernels,"In order to exploit kernel substitution, we need to be able to construct valid kernel. functions. One approach is to choose a feature space mapping φ(x) and then use. this to find the corresponding kernel, as is illustrated in Figure 6.1. Here the kernel. function is defined for a one-dimensional input space by. k(x, x) = φ(x)Tφ(x) =. φi(x)φi(x). (6.10). where φi(x) are the basis functions.. An alternative approach is to construct kernel functions directly. In this case,. we must ensure that the function we choose is a valid kernel, in other words that it. corresponds to a scalar product in some (perhaps infinite dimensional) feature space.. As a simple example, consider a kernel function given by. k(x, z) =. xTz. 2. (6.11). 1. 0.5. 0. −0.5. −1. −1. 0.04. 0.02. 0. −1. 1. 0.75. 0.5. 0.25. 0. −1. 0.04. 0.02. 0. −1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 6.2.

If we take the particular case of a two-dimensional input space x = (x1, x2) we. can expand out the terms and thereby identify the corresponding nonlinear feature. mapping. k(x, z) =. 2 = (x1z1 + x2z2)2. 2z2. 2. xTz. = x2. 1 + 2x1z1x2z2 + x2. 1z2. 1,√2x1x2, x2. = (x2. = φ(x)Tφ(z).. 1,√2z1z2, z2. 2)T. 2)(z2. (6.12). 2)T and. We see that the feature mapping takes the form φ(x) = (x2. therefore comprises all possible second order terms, with a specific weighting be-. tween them.. 1,√2x1x2, x2. More generally, however, we need a simple way to test whether a function con-. stitutes a valid kernel without having to construct the function φ(x) explicitly. A. necessary and sufficient condition for a function k(x, x) to be a valid kernel (Shawe-. Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) is that the Gram matrix K, whose elements are given by. k(xn, xm), should be positive semidefinite for all possible choices of the set {xn}.. Note that a positive semidefinite matrix is not the same thing as a matrix whose. elements are nonnegative.. One powerful technique for constructing new kernels is to build them out of. simpler kernels as building blocks. This can be done using the following properties:. Appendix C. 296. 6. KERNEL METHODS. Techniques for Constructing New Kernels.. Given valid kernels k1(x, x) and k2(x, x), the following new kernels will also. be valid:. k(x, x) = ck1(x, x). k(x, x) = f(x)k1(x, x)f(x). k(x, x) = q (k1(x, x)). k(x, x) = exp (k1(x, x)). k(x, x) = k1(x, x) + k2(x, x). k(x, x) = k1(x, x)k2(x, x). k(x, x) = k3 (φ(x), φ(x)). k(x, x) = xTAx. k(x, x) = ka(xa, xa) + kb(xb, xb). k(x, x) = ka(xa, xa)kb(xb, xb). (6.13). (6.14). (6.15). (6.16). (6.17). (6.18). (6.19). (6.20). (6.21). (6.22). where c > 0 is a constant, f(·) is any function, q(·) is a polynomial with nonneg-. ative coefficients, φ(x) is a function from x to RM , k3(·,·) is a valid kernel in. RM , A is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, xa and xb are variables (not. necessarily disjoint) with x = (xa, xb), and ka and kb are valid kernel functions. over their respective spaces.. Equipped with these properties, we can now embark on the construction of more. complex kernels appropriate to specific applications. We require that the kernel. k(x, x) be symmetric and positive semidefinite and that it expresses the appropriate. form of similarity between x and x according to the intended application. Here we. consider a few common examples of kernel functions. For a more extensive discus-. sion of ‘kernel engineering’, see Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004).. We saw that the simple polynomial kernel k(x, x) =. xTx. 2 contains only. If we consider the slightly generalized kernel k(x, x) =. 2 with c > 0, then the corresponding feature mapping φ(x) contains con-. M. terms of degree two.. xTx + c. stant and linear terms as well as terms of order two. Similarly, k(x, x) =. contains all monomials of order M. For instance, if x and x are two images, then. the kernel represents a particular weighted sum of all possible products of M pixels. in the first image with M pixels in the second image. This can similarly be gener-. M. alized to include all terms up to degree M by considering k(x, x) =. with c > 0. Using the results (6.17) and (6.18) for combining kernels we see that. these will all be valid kernel functions.. xTx + c. xTx. Another commonly used kernel takes the form. k(x, x) = exp. −x − x2/2σ2. (6.23). and is often called a ‘Gaussian’ kernel. Note, however, that in this context it is. not interpreted as a probability density, and hence the normalization coefficient is. Exercise 6.11. Exercise 6.12. 6.2. Constructing Kernels. 297. (6.24). (6.25). omitted. We can see that this is a valid kernel by expanding the square. x − x2 = xTx + (x)Tx − 2xTx. to give. k(x, x) = exp. −xTx/2σ2. exp. xTx/σ2. exp. −(x)Tx/2σ2. and then making use of (6.14) and (6.16), together with the validity of the linear. kernel k(x, x) = xTx. Note that the feature vector that corresponds to the Gaussian. kernel has infinite dimensionality.. The Gaussian kernel is not restricted to the use of Euclidean distance. If we use. kernel substitution in (6.24) to replace xTx with a nonlinear kernel κ(x, x), we. obtain. k(x, x) = exp. 1. 2σ2 (κ(x, x) + κ(x, x) − 2κ(x, x)). (6.26). An important contribution to arise from the kernel viewpoint has been the exten-. sion to inputs that are symbolic, rather than simply vectors of real numbers. Kernel. functions can be defined over objects as diverse as graphs, sets, strings, and text doc-. uments. Consider, for instance, a fixed set and define a nonvectorial space consisting. of all possible subsets of this set. If A1 and A2 are two such subsets then one simple. choice of kernel would be. k(A1, A2) = 2|A1∩A2|. (6.27). where A1 ∩ A2 denotes the intersection of sets A1 and A2, and |A| denotes the. number of subsets in A. This is a valid kernel function because it can be shown to. correspond to an inner product in a feature space.. One powerful approach to the construction of kernels starts from a probabilistic. generative model (Haussler, 1999), which allows us to apply generative models in a. discriminative setting. Generative models can deal naturally with missing data and. in the case of hidden Markov models can handle sequences of varying length. By. contrast, discriminative models generally give better performance on discriminative. tasks than generative models. It is therefore of some interest to combine these two. approaches (Lasserre et al., 2006). One way to combine them is to use a generative. model to define a kernel, and then use this kernel in a discriminative approach.. Given a generative model p(x) we can define a kernel by. k(x, x) = p(x)p(x).. (6.28). This is clearly a valid kernel function because we can interpret it as an inner product. in the one-dimensional feature space defined by the mapping p(x). It says that two. inputs x and x are similar if they both have high probabilities. We can use (6.13) and. (6.17) to extend this class of kernels by considering sums over products of different. probability distributions, with positive weighting coefficients p(i), of the form. k(x, x) =. p(x|i)p(x|i)p(i).. i. (6.29). Z. N. 298. 6. KERNEL METHODS. This is equivalent, up to an overall multiplicative constant, to a mixture distribution. in which the components factorize, with the index i playing the role of a ‘latent’. variable. Two inputs x and x will give a large value for the kernel function, and. hence appear similar, if they have significant probability under a range of different. components. Taking the limit of an infinite sum, we can also consider kernels of the. form. k(x, x) =. p(x|z)p(x|z)p(z) dz. (6.30). where z is a continuous latent variable.. Now suppose that our data consists of ordered sequences of length L so that. an observation is given by X = {x1, . . . , xL}. A popular generative model for. sequences is the hidden Markov model, which expresses the distribution p(X) as a. marginalization over a corresponding sequence of hidden states Z = {z1, . . . , zL}.. We can use this approach to define a kernel function measuring the similarity of two. sequences X and X by extending the mixture representation (6.29) to give. k(X, X) =. p(X|Z)p(X|Z)p(Z). (6.31). so that both observed sequences are generated by the same hidden sequence Z. This. model can easily be extended to allow sequences of differing length to be compared.. An alternative technique for using generative models to define kernel functions. is known as the Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999). Consider a parametric. generative model p(x|θ) where θ denotes the vector of parameters. The goal is to. find a kernel that measures the similarity of two input vectors x and x induced by the. generative model. Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) consider the gradient with respect. to θ, which defines a vector in a ‘feature’ space having the same dimensionality as. θ. In particular, they consider the Fisher score. Section 9.2. Section 13.2. Exercise 6.13. from which the Fisher kernel is defined by. g(θ, x) = ∇θ ln p(x|θ). Here F is the Fisher information matrix, given by. k(x, x) = g(θ, x)TF−1g(θ, x).. (6.32). (6.33). F = Ex. g(θ, x)g(θ, x)T. (6.34). where the expectation is with respect to x under the distribution p(x|θ). This can. be motivated from the perspective of information geometry (Amari, 1998), which. considers the differential geometry of the space of model parameters. Here we sim-. ply note that the presence of the Fisher information matrix causes this kernel to be. invariant under a nonlinear re-parameterization of the density model θ → ψ(θ).. In practice, it is often infeasible to evaluate the Fisher information matrix. One. approach is simply to replace the expectation in the definition of the Fisher informa-. tion with the sample average, giving. 1. N. F . g(θ, xn)g(θ, xn)T.. (6.35). n=1. N. "
121,6.3,Radial Basis Function Networks,"299. Section 12.1.3. Section 6.4.7. This is the covariance matrix of the Fisher scores, and so the Fisher kernel corre-. sponds to a whitening of these scores. More simply, we can just omit the Fisher. information matrix altogether and use the noninvariant kernel. k(x, x) = g(θ, x)Tg(θ, x).. (6.36). An application of Fisher kernels to document retrieval is given by Hofmann (2000).. A final example of a kernel function is the sigmoidal kernel given by. k(x, x) = tanh. axTx + b. (6.37). whose Gram matrix in general is not positive semidefinite. This form of kernel. has, however, been used in practice (Vapnik, 1995), possibly because it gives kernel. expansions such as the support vector machine a superficial resemblance to neural. network models. As we shall see, in the limit of an infinite number of basis functions,. a Bayesian neural network with an appropriate prior reduces to a Gaussian process,. thereby providing a deeper link between neural networks and kernel methods.. 6.3. Radial Basis Function Networks. In Chapter 3, we discussed regression models based on linear combinations of fixed. basis functions, although we did not discuss in detail what form those basis functions. might take. One choice that has been widely used is that of radial basis functions,. which have the property that each basis function depends only on the radial distance. (typically Euclidean) from a centre µj, so that φj(x) = h(x − µj).. Historically, radial basis functions were introduced for the purpose of exact func-. tion interpolation (Powell, 1987). Given a set of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along. with corresponding target values {t1, . . . , tN}, the goal is to find a smooth function. f(x) that fits every target value exactly, so that f(xn) = tn for n = 1, . . . , N. This. is achieved by expressing f(x) as a linear combination of radial basis functions, one. centred on every data point. f(x) =. wnh(x − xn).. n=1. (6.38). The values of the coefficients {wn} are found by least squares, and because there. are the same number of coefficients as there are constraints, the result is a function. that fits every target value exactly. In pattern recognition applications, however, the. target values are generally noisy, and exact interpolation is undesirable because this. corresponds to an over-fitted solution.. Expansions in radial basis functions also arise from regularization theory (Pog-. gio and Girosi, 1990; Bishop, 1995a). For a sum-of-squares error function with a. regularizer defined in terms of a differential operator, the optimal solution is given. by an expansion in the Green’s functions of the operator (which are analogous to the. eigenvectors of a discrete matrix), again with one basis function centred on each data. N. n=1. n=1. N. 300. 6. KERNEL METHODS. point. If the differential operator is isotropic then the Green’s functions depend only. on the radial distance from the corresponding data point. Due to the presence of the. regularizer, the solution no longer interpolates the training data exactly.. Another motivation for radial basis functions comes from a consideration of. the interpolation problem when the input (rather than the target) variables are noisy. If the noise on the input variable x is described. (Webb, 1994; Bishop, 1995a).. by a variable ξ having a distribution ν(ξ), then the sum-of-squares error function. becomes. E =. 1. 2. {y(xn + ξ) − tn}2 ν(ξ) dξ.. Appendix D. Exercise 6.17. Using the calculus of variations, we can optimize with respect to the function f(x). to give. (6.39). (6.40). (6.41). where the basis functions are given by. y(xn) =. tnh(x − xn). h(x − xn) = ν(x − xn). ν(x − xn). N. n=1. We see that there is one basis function centred on every data point. This is known as. the Nadaraya-Watson model and will be derived again from a different perspective. in Section 6.3.1. If the noise distribution ν(ξ) is isotropic, so that it is a function. only of ξ, then the basis functions will be radial.. n h(x − xn) = 1. for any value of x. The effect of such normalization is shown in Figure 6.2. Normal-. ization is sometimes used in practice as it avoids having regions of input space where. all of the basis functions take small values, which would necessarily lead to predic-. tions in such regions that are either small or controlled purely by the bias parameter.. Note that the basis functions (6.41) are normalized, so that. Another situation in which expansions in normalized radial basis functions arise. is in the application of kernel density estimation to the problem of regression, as we. shall discuss in Section 6.3.1.. Because there is one basis function associated with every data point, the corre-. sponding model can be computationally costly to evaluate when making predictions. for new data points. Models have therefore been proposed (Broomhead and Lowe,. 1988; Moody and Darken, 1989; Poggio and Girosi, 1990), which retain the expan-. sion in radial basis functions but where the number M of basis functions is smaller. than the number N of data points. Typically, the number of basis functions, and the. locations µi of their centres, are determined based on the input data {xn} alone. The. basis functions are then kept fixed and the coefficients {wi} are determined by least. squares by solving the usual set of linear equations, as discussed in Section 3.1.1.. 6.3.

One of the simplest ways of choosing basis function centres is to use a randomly. chosen subset of the data points. A more systematic approach is called orthogonal. least squares (Chen et al., 1991). This is a sequential selection process in which at. each step the next data point to be chosen as a basis function centre corresponds to. the one that gives the greatest reduction in the sum-of-squares error. Values for the. expansion coefficients are determined as part of the algorithm. Clustering algorithms. such as K-means have also been used, which give a set of basis function centres that. no longer coincide with training data points.. "
122,6.3.1,Nadaraya-Watson model,"In Section 3.3.3, we saw that the prediction of a linear regression model for a. new input x takes the form of a linear combination of the training set target values. with coefficients given by the ‘equivalent kernel’ (3.62) where the equivalent kernel. satisfies the summation constraint (3.64).. We can motivate the kernel regression model (3.61) from a different perspective,. starting with kernel density estimation. Suppose we have a training set {xn, tn} and. we use a Parzen density estimator to model the joint distribution p(x, t), so that. p(x, t) =. 1. N. f(x − xn, t − tn). n=1. (6.42). where f(x, t) is the component density function, and there is one such component. centred on each data point. We now find an expression for the regression function. y(x), corresponding to the conditional average of the target variable conditioned on. m. m. n. n. m. n. N. y(x) =. g(x − xn)tn. g(x − xm). k(x, xn)tn. k(x, xn) = g(x − xn). g(x − xm). g(x) =. f(x, t) dt.. k(x, xn) = 1.. n=1. where n, m = 1, . . . , N and the kernel function k(x, xn) is given by. and we have defined. The result (6.45) is known as the Nadaraya-Watson model, or kernel regression. (Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964). For a localized kernel function, it has the prop-. erty of giving more weight to the data points xn that are close to x. Note that the. kernel (6.46) satisfies the summation constraint. 302. 6.

Exercise 6.18. from which other expectations can be evaluated.. As an illustration we consider the case of a single input variable x in which. f(x, t) is given by a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian over the variable z = (x, t) with. variance σ2. The corresponding conditional distribution (6.48) is given by a Gaus-. sian mixture, and is shown, together with the conditional mean, for the sinusoidal. synthetic data set in Figure 6.3.. An obvious extension of this model is to allow for more flexible forms of Gaus-. sian components, for instance having different variance parameters for the input and. target variables. More generally, we could model the joint distribution p(t, x) using. a Gaussian mixture model, trained using techniques discussed in Chapter 9 (Ghahra-. mani and Jordan, 1994), and then find the corresponding conditional distribution. p(t|x). In this latter case we no longer have a representation in terms of kernel func-. tions evaluated at the training set data points. However, the number of components. in the mixture model can be smaller than the number of training set points, resulting. in a model that is faster to evaluate for test data points. We have thereby accepted an. increased computational cost during the training phase in order to have a model that. is faster at making predictions.. 6.4. Gaussian Processes. In Section 6.1, we introduced kernels by applying the concept of duality to a non-. probabilistic model for regression. Here we extend the role of kernels to probabilis-. 304. 6. KERNEL METHODS. tic discriminative models, leading to the framework of Gaussian processes. We shall. thereby see how kernels arise naturally in a Bayesian setting.. In Chapter 3, we considered linear regression models of the form y(x, w) =. wTφ(x) in which w is a vector of parameters and φ(x) is a vector of fixed nonlinear. basis functions that depend on the input vector x. We showed that a prior distribution. over w induced a corresponding prior distribution over functions y(x, w). Given a. training data set, we then evaluated the posterior distribution over w and thereby. obtained the corresponding posterior distribution over regression functions, which. in turn (with the addition of noise) implies a predictive distribution p(t|x) for new. input vectors x.. In the Gaussian process viewpoint, we dispense with the parametric model and. instead define a prior probability distribution over functions directly. At first sight, it. might seem difficult to work with a distribution over the uncountably infinite space of. functions. However, as we shall see, for a finite training set we only need to consider. the values of the function at the discrete set of input values xn corresponding to the. training set and test set data points, and so in practice we can work in a finite space.. Models equivalent to Gaussian processes have been widely studied in many dif-. ferent fields. For instance, in the geostatistics literature Gaussian process regression. is known as kriging (Cressie, 1993). Similarly, ARMA (autoregressive moving aver-. age) models, Kalman filters, and radial basis function networks can all be viewed as. forms of Gaussian process models. Reviews of Gaussian processes from a machine. learning perspective can be found in MacKay (1998), Williams (1999), and MacKay. (2003), and a comparison of Gaussian process models with alternative approaches is. given in Rasmussen (1996). See also Rasmussen and Williams (2006) for a recent. textbook on Gaussian processes.. "
124,6.4.1,Linear regression revisited,"In order to motivate the Gaussian process viewpoint, let us return to the linear. regression example and re-derive the predictive distribution by working in terms. of distributions over functions y(x, w). This will provide a specific example of a. Gaussian process.. Consider a model defined in terms of a linear combination of M fixed basis. functions given by the elements of the vector φ(x) so that. y(x) = wTφ(x). (6.49). where x is the input vector and w is the M-dimensional weight vector. Now consider. a prior distribution over w given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form. p(w) = N (w|0, α−1I). (6.50). governed by the hyperparameter α, which represents the precision (inverse variance). of the distribution. For any given value of w, the definition (6.49) defines a partic-. ular function of x. The probability distribution over w defined by (6.50) therefore. induces a probability distribution over functions y(x). In practice, we wish to eval-. uate this function at specific values of x, for example at the training data points. (6.52). (6.53). (6.54). 6.4. Gaussian Processes. 305. x1, . . . , xN . We are therefore interested in the joint distribution of the function val-. ues y(x1), . . . , y(xN ), which we denote by the vector y with elements yn = y(xn). for n = 1, . . . , N. From (6.49), this vector is given by. y = Φw. (6.51). where Φ is the design matrix with elements Φnk = φk(xn). We can find the proba-. bility distribution of y as follows. First of all we note that y is a linear combination of. Gaussian distributed variables given by the elements of w and hence is itself Gaus-. sian. We therefore need only to find its mean and covariance, which are given from. (6.50) by. E[y] = ΦE[w] = 0. cov[y] = E. = ΦE. where K is the Gram matrix with elements. yyT. wwT. ΦT =. 1. ΦΦT = K. Knm = k(xn, xm) =. 1. φ(xn)Tφ(xm). and k(x, x) is the kernel function.. This model provides us with a particular example of a Gaussian process. In gen-. eral, a Gaussian process is defined as a probability distribution over functions y(x). such that the set of values of y(x) evaluated at an arbitrary set of points x1, . . . , xN. jointly have a Gaussian distribution. In cases where the input vector x is two di-. mensional, this may also be known as a Gaussian random field. More generally, a. stochastic process y(x) is specified by giving the joint probability distribution for. any finite set of values y(x1), . . . , y(xN ) in a consistent manner.. A key point about Gaussian stochastic processes is that the joint distribution. over N variables y1, . . . , yN is specified completely by the second-order statistics,. namely the mean and the covariance. In most applications, we will not have any. prior knowledge about the mean of y(x) and so by symmetry we take it to be zero.. This is equivalent to choosing the mean of the prior over weight values p(w|α) to. be zero in the basis function viewpoint. The specification of the Gaussian process is. then completed by giving the covariance of y(x) evaluated at any two values of x,. which is given by the kernel function. E [y(xn)y(xm)] = k(xn, xm).. (6.55). For the specific case of a Gaussian process defined by the linear regression model. (6.49) with a weight prior (6.50), the kernel function is given by (6.54).. We can also define the kernel function directly, rather than indirectly through a. choice of basis function. Figure 6.4 shows samples of functions drawn from Gaus-. sian processes for two different choices of kernel function. The first of these is a. ‘Gaussian’ kernel of the form (6.23), and the second is the exponential kernel given. by. k(x, x) = exp (−θ |x − x|). (6.56). which corresponds to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process originally introduced by Uh-. lenbeck and Ornstein (1930) to describe Brownian motion.. Exercise 2.31. 306. 6. KERNEL METHODS.

125,6.4.2,Gaussian processes for regression,"In order to apply Gaussian process models to the problem of regression, we need. to take account of the noise on the observed target values, which are given by. tn = yn + 	n. (6.57). where yn = y(xn), and 	n is a random noise variable whose value is chosen inde-. pendently for each observation n. Here we shall consider noise processes that have. a Gaussian distribution, so that. p(tn|yn) = N (tn|yn, β−1). (6.58). where β is a hyperparameter representing the precision of the noise. Because the. noise is independent for each data point, the joint distribution of the target values. t = (t1, . . . , tN )T conditioned on the values of y = (y1, . . . , yN )T is given by an. isotropic Gaussian of the form. (6.59). where IN denotes the N × N unit matrix. From the definition of a Gaussian process,. the marginal distribution p(y) is given by a Gaussian whose mean is zero and whose. covariance is defined by a Gram matrix K so that. p(t|y) = N (t|y, β−1IN ). p(y) = N (y|0, K).. (6.60). The kernel function that determines K is typically chosen to express the property. that, for points xn and xm that are similar, the corresponding values y(xn) and. y(xm) will be more strongly correlated than for dissimilar points. Here the notion. of similarity will depend on the application.. In order to find the marginal distribution p(t), conditioned on the input values. x1, . . . , xN , we need to integrate over y. This can be done by making use of the. results from Section 2.3.3 for the linear-Gaussian model. Using (2.115), we see that. the marginal distribution of t is given by. p(t) =. p(t|y)p(y) dy = N (t|0, C). (6.61). 6.4. Gaussian Processes. 307. (6.62). where the covariance matrix C has elements. C(xn, xm) = k(xn, xm) + β−1δnm.. This result reflects the fact that the two Gaussian sources of randomness, namely. that associated with y(x) and that associated with 	, are independent and so their. covariances simply add.. One widely used kernel function for Gaussian process regression is given by the. exponential of a quadratic form, with the addition of constant and linear terms to. give. k(xn, xm) = θ0 exp. θ1. 2 xn − xm2. + θ2 + θ3xT. nxm.. (6.63). Note that the term involving θ3 corresponds to a parametric model that is a linear. function of the input variables. Samples from this prior are plotted for various values. of the parameters θ0, . . . , θ3 in Figure 6.5, and Figure 6.6 shows a set of points sam-. pled from the joint distribution (6.60) along with the corresponding values defined. by (6.61).. So far, we have used the Gaussian process viewpoint to build a model of the. joint distribution over sets of data points. Our goal in regression, however, is to. make predictions of the target variables for new inputs, given a set of training data.. Let us suppose that tN = (t1, . . . , tN )T, corresponding to input values x1, . . . , xN ,. comprise the observed training set, and our goal is to predict the target variable tN +1. for a new input vector xN +1. This requires that we evaluate the predictive distri-. bution p(tN +1|tN ). Note that this distribution is conditioned also on the variables. x1, . . . , xN and xN +1. However, to keep the notation simple we will not show these. conditioning variables explicitly.. To find the conditional distribution p(tN +1|t), we begin by writing down the. joint distribution p(tN +1), where tN +1 denotes the vector (t1, . . . , tN , tN +1)T. We. then apply the results from Section 2.3.1 to obtain the required conditional distribu-. tion, as illustrated in Figure 6.7.. From (6.61), the joint distribution over t1, . . . , tN +1 will be given by. p(tN +1) = N (tN +1|0, CN +1). (6.64). where CN +1 is an (N + 1) × (N + 1) covariance matrix with elements given by. (6.62). Because this joint distribution is Gaussian, we can apply the results from. Section 2.3.1 to find the conditional Gaussian distribution. To do this, we partition. the covariance matrix as follows. CN +1 =. CN k. kT. c. (6.65). where CN is the N × N covariance matrix with elements given by (6.62) for n, m =. 1, . . . , N, the vector k has elements k(xn, xN +1) for n = 1, . . . , N, and the scalar. 308. 6.

The title above. each plot denotes (θ0, θ1, θ2, θ3).. c = k(xN +1, xN +1) + β−1. Using the results (2.81) and (2.82), we see that the con-. ditional distribution p(tN +1|t) is a Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance. given by. m(xN +1) = kTC−1. N t. σ2(xN +1) = c − kTC−1. N k.. (6.66). (6.67). These are the key results that define Gaussian process regression. Because the vector. k is a function of the test point input value xN +1, we see that the predictive distribu-. tion is a Gaussian whose mean and variance both depend on xN +1. An example of. Gaussian process regression is shown in Figure 6.8.. The only restriction on the kernel function is that the covariance matrix given by. (6.62) must be positive definite. If λi is an eigenvalue of K, then the corresponding. eigenvalue of C will be λi + β−1. It is therefore sufficient that the kernel matrix. k(xn, xm) be positive semidefinite for any pair of points xn and xm, so that λi � 0,. because any eigenvalue λi that is zero will still give rise to a positive eigenvalue. for C because β > 0. This is the same restriction on the kernel function discussed. earlier, and so we can again exploit all of the techniques in Section 6.2 to construct. −1. N. −3.

Thus, if the kernel function k(xn, xm). depends only on the distance xn − xm, then we obtain an expansion in radial. basis functions.. The results (6.66) and (6.67) define the predictive distribution for Gaussian pro-. cess regression with an arbitrary kernel function k(xn, xm). In the particular case in. which the kernel function k(x, x) is defined in terms of a finite set of basis functions,. we can derive the results obtained previously in Section 3.3.2 for linear regression. starting from the Gaussian process viewpoint.. For such models, we can therefore obtain the predictive distribution either by. taking a parameter space viewpoint and using the linear regression result or by taking. a function space viewpoint and using the Gaussian process result.. The central computational operation in using Gaussian processes will involve. the inversion of a matrix of size N × N, for which standard methods require O(N 3). computations. By contrast, in the basis function model we have to invert a matrix. SN of size M × M, which has O(M 3) computational complexity. Note that for. both viewpoints, the matrix inversion must be performed once for the given training. set. For each new test point, both methods require a vector-matrix multiply, which. has cost O(N 2) in the Gaussian process case and O(M 2) for the linear basis func-. tion model. If the number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of. data points, it will be computationally more efficient to work in the basis function. 310. 6. KERNEL METHODS.

However, an advantage of a Gaussian processes viewpoint is that we. can consider covariance functions that can only be expressed in terms of an infinite. number of basis functions.. For large training data sets, however, the direct application of Gaussian process. methods can become infeasible, and so a range of approximation schemes have been. developed that have better scaling with training set size than the exact approach. (Gibbs, 1997; Tresp, 2001; Smola and Bartlett, 2001; Williams and Seeger, 2001;. Csat´o and Opper, 2002; Seeger et al., 2003). Practical issues in the application of. Gaussian processes are discussed in Bishop and Nabney (2008).. We have introduced Gaussian process regression for the case of a single tar-. get variable.

"
126,6.4.3,Learning the hyperparameters,"The predictions of a Gaussian process model will depend, in part, on the choice. of covariance function. In practice, rather than fixing the covariance function, we. may prefer to use a parametric family of functions and then infer the parameter. values from the data. These parameters govern such things as the length scale of the. correlations and the precision of the noise and correspond to the hyperparameters in. a standard parametric model.. Techniques for learning the hyperparameters are based on the evaluation of the. likelihood function p(t|θ) where θ denotes the hyperparameters of the Gaussian pro-. cess model. The simplest approach is to make a point estimate of θ by maximizing. the log likelihood function. Because θ represents a set of hyperparameters for the. regression problem, this can be viewed as analogous to the type 2 maximum like-. lihood procedure for linear regression models. Maximization of the log likelihood. can be done using efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms such as conjugate. gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008).. The log likelihood function for a Gaussian process regression model is easily. evaluated using the standard form for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, giving. ln p(t|θ) = −. ln|CN| −. tTC−1. N t −. N. 2. ln(2π).. (6.69). For nonlinear optimization, we also need the gradient of the log likelihood func-. tion with respect to the parameter vector θ. We shall assume that evaluation of the. derivatives of CN is straightforward, as would be the case for the covariance func-. tions considered in this chapter. Making use of the result (C.21) for the derivative of. C−1. N , together with the result (C.22) for the derivative of ln|CN|, we obtain. ∂θi. ln p(t|θ) = −. 1. 2. Tr. C−1. N. ∂CN. ∂θi. 1. 2. tTC−1. N. ∂CN. ∂θi. C−1. N t.. (6.70). Because ln p(t|θ) will in general be a nonconvex function, it can have multiple max-. ima.. It is straightforward to introduce a prior over θ and to maximize the log poste-. rior using gradient-based methods. In a fully Bayesian treatment, we need to evaluate. marginals over θ weighted by the product of the prior p(θ) and the likelihood func-. tion p(t|θ). In general, however, exact marginalization will be intractable, and we. must resort to approximations.. The Gaussian process regression model gives a predictive distribution whose. mean and variance are functions of the input vector x. However, we have assumed. that the contribution to the predictive variance arising from the additive noise, gov-. erned by the parameter β, is a constant. For some problems, known as heteroscedas-. tic, the noise variance itself will also depend on x. To model this, we can extend the. Section 3.5. 2. 312. 6. KERNEL METHODS. for Gaussian processes,.

Because β is a variance,. and hence nonnegative, we use the Gaussian process to model ln β(x).. "
127,6.4.4,Automatic relevance determination,"In the previous section, we saw how maximum likelihood could be used to de-. termine a value for the correlation length-scale parameter in a Gaussian process.. This technique can usefully be extended by incorporating a separate parameter for. each input variable (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). The result, as we shall see, is. that the optimization of these parameters by maximum likelihood allows the relative. importance of different inputs to be inferred from the data. This represents an exam-. ple in the Gaussian process context of automatic relevance determination, or ARD,. which was originally formulated in the framework of neural networks (MacKay,. 1994; Neal, 1996). The mechanism by which appropriate inputs are preferred is. discussed in Section 7.2.2.. Consider a Gaussian process with a two-dimensional input space x = (x1, x2),. having a kernel function of the form. k(x, x) = θ0 exp. 1. 2. ηi(xi − xi)2. i=1. (6.71). Samples from the resulting prior over functions y(x) are shown for two different. settings of the precision parameters ηi in Figure 6.9. We see that, as a particu-. lar parameter ηi becomes small, the function becomes relatively insensitive to the. corresponding input variable xi. By adapting these parameters to a data set using. maximum likelihood, it becomes possible to detect input variables that have little. effect on the predictive distribution, because the corresponding values of ηi will be. small. This can be useful in practice because it allows such inputs to be discarded.. ARD is illustrated using a simple synthetic data set having three inputs x1, x2 and x3. (Nabney, 2002) in Figure 6.10. The target variable t, is generated by sampling 100. values of x1 from a Gaussian, evaluating the function sin(2πx1), and then adding. D. D. 6.4. Gaussian Processes. 313.

Values of x2 are given by copying the corresponding values of x1. and adding noise, and values of x3 are sampled from an independent Gaussian dis-. tribution. Thus x1 is a good predictor of t, x2 is a more noisy predictor of t, and x3. has only chance correlations with t. The marginal likelihood for a Gaussian process. with ARD parameters η1, η2, η3 is optimized using the scaled conjugate gradients. algorithm. We see from Figure 6.10 that η1 converges to a relatively large value, η2. converges to a much smaller value, and η3 becomes very small indicating that x3 is. irrelevant for predicting t.. The ARD framework is easily incorporated into the exponential-quadratic kernel. (6.63) to give the following form of kernel function, which has been found useful for. applications of Gaussian processes to a range of regression problems. k(xn, xm) = θ0 exp. 1. 2. ηi(xni − xmi)2. i=1. + θ2 + θ3. xnixmi.

128,6.4.5,Gaussian processes for classification,"In a probabilistic approach to classification, our goal is to model the posterior. probabilities of the target variable for a new input vector, given a set of training. data. These probabilities must lie in the interval (0, 1), whereas a Gaussian process. model makes predictions that lie on the entire real axis. However, we can easily. adapt Gaussian processes to classification problems by transforming the output of. the Gaussian process using an appropriate nonlinear activation function.. Consider first the two-class problem with a target variable t ∈ {0, 1}. If we de-. fine a Gaussian process over a function a(x) and then transform the function using. a logistic sigmoid y = σ(a), given by (4.59), then we will obtain a non-Gaussian. stochastic process over functions y(x) where y ∈ (0, 1). This is illustrated for the. case of a one-dimensional input space in Figure 6.11 in which the probability distri-. 314. 6.

Figure 6.11 The left plot shows a sample from a Gaussian process prior over functions a(x), and the right plot. shows the result of transforming this sample using a logistic sigmoid function.. bution over the target variable t is then given by the Bernoulli distribution. p(t|a) = σ(a)t(1 − σ(a))1−t.. (6.73). As usual, we denote the training set inputs by x1, . . . , xN with corresponding. observed target variables t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. We also consider a single test point. xN +1 with target value tN +1. Our goal is to determine the predictive distribution. p(tN +1|t), where we have left the conditioning on the input variables implicit. To do. this we introduce a Gaussian process prior over the vector aN +1, which has compo-. nents a(x1), . . . , a(xN +1). This in turn defines a non-Gaussian process over tN +1,. and by conditioning on the training data tN we obtain the required predictive distri-. bution. The Gaussian process prior for aN +1 takes the form. p(aN +1) = N (aN +1|0, CN +1).. (6.74). Unlike the regression case, the covariance matrix no longer includes a noise term. because we assume that all of the training data points are correctly labelled. How-. ever, for numerical reasons it is convenient to introduce a noise-like term governed. by a parameter ν that ensures that the covariance matrix is positive definite. Thus. the covariance matrix CN +1 has elements given by. C(xn, xm) = k(xn, xm) + νδnm. (6.75). where k(xn, xm) is any positive semidefinite kernel function of the kind considered. in Section 6.2, and the value of ν is typically fixed in advance. We shall assume that. the kernel function k(x, x) is governed by a vector θ of parameters, and we shall. later discuss how θ may be learned from the training data.. For two-class problems, it is sufficient to predict p(tN +1 = 1|tN ) because the. value of p(tN +1 = 0|tN ) is then given by 1 − p(tN +1 = 1|tN ). The required. predictive distribution is given by. p(tN +1 = 1|tN ) =. p(tN +1 = 1|aN +1)p(aN +1|tN ) daN +1. (6.76). where p(tN +1 = 1|aN +1) = σ(aN +1).. This integral is analytically intractable, and so may be approximated using sam-. pling methods (Neal, 1997). Alternatively, we can consider techniques based on. an analytical approximation. In Section 4.5.2, we derived the approximate formula. (4.153) for the convolution of a logistic sigmoid with a Gaussian distribution. We. can use this result to evaluate the integral in (6.76) provided we have a Gaussian. approximation to the posterior distribution p(aN +1|tN ). The usual justification for a. Gaussian approximation to a posterior distribution is that the true posterior will tend. to a Gaussian as the number of data points increases as a consequence of the central. limit theorem. In the case of Gaussian processes, the number of variables grows with. the number of data points, and so this argument does not apply directly. However, if. we consider increasing the number of data points falling in a fixed region of x space,. then the corresponding uncertainty in the function a(x) will decrease, again leading. asymptotically to a Gaussian (Williams and Barber, 1998).. Three different approaches to obtaining a Gaussian approximation have been. considered. One technique is based on variational inference (Gibbs and MacKay,. 2000) and makes use of the local variational bound (10.144) on the logistic sigmoid.. This allows the product of sigmoid functions to be approximated by a product of. Gaussians thereby allowing the marginalization over aN to be performed analyti-. cally. The approach also yields a lower bound on the likelihood function p(tN|θ).. The variational framework for Gaussian process classification can also be extended. to multiclass (K > 2) problems by using a Gaussian approximation to the softmax. function (Gibbs, 1997).. A second approach uses expectation propagation (Opper and Winther, 2000b;. Minka, 2001b; Seeger, 2003). Because the true posterior distribution is unimodal, as. we shall see shortly, the expectation propagation approach can give good results.. "
129,6.4.6,Laplace approximation,"The third approach to Gaussian process classification is based on the Laplace. approximation, which we now consider in detail. In order to evaluate the predictive. distribution (6.76), we seek a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. over aN +1, which, using Bayes’ theorem, is given by. p(aN +1|tN ) =. p(aN +1, aN|tN ) daN. 1. p(tN ). 1. p(tN ). p(aN +1, aN )p(tN|aN +1, aN ) daN. p(aN +1|aN )p(aN )p(tN|aN ) daN. p(aN +1|aN )p(aN|tN ) daN.

The conditional distribution. p(aN +1|aN ) is obtained by invoking the results (6.66) and (6.67) for Gaussian pro-. cess regression, to give. p(aN +1|aN ) = N (aN +1|kTC−1. N aN , c − kTC−1. N k).. (6.78). We can therefore evaluate the integral in (6.77) by finding a Laplace approximation. for the posterior distribution p(aN|tN ), and then using the standard result for the. convolution of two Gaussian distributions.. The prior p(aN ) is given by a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance ma-. trix CN , and the data term (assuming independence of the data points) is given by. p(tN|aN ) =. n=1. σ(an)tn(1 − σ(an))1−tn =. eantnσ(−an).. n=1. (6.79). We then obtain the Laplace approximation by Taylor expanding the logarithm of. p(aN|tN ), which up to an additive normalization constant is given by the quantity. Ψ(aN ) = ln p(aN ) + ln p(tN|aN ). N C−1. aT. N aN −. N. 2. ln(2π) −. 1. 2. ln|CN| + tT. N aN. ln(1 + ean) + const.. n=1. (6.80). First we need to find the mode of the posterior distribution, and this requires that we. evaluate the gradient of Ψ(aN ), which is given by. ∇Ψ(aN ) = tN − σN − C−1. N aN. (6.81). where σN is a vector with elements σ(an). We cannot simply find the mode by. setting this gradient to zero, because σN depends nonlinearly on aN , and so we. resort to an iterative scheme based on the Newton-Raphson method, which gives rise. to an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. This requires the second. derivatives of Ψ(aN ), which we also require for the Laplace approximation anyway,. and which are given by. N. ∇∇Ψ(aN ) = −WN − C−1. (6.82). where WN is a diagonal matrix with elements σ(an)(1− σ(an)), and we have used. the result (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function. Note that these. diagonal elements lie in the range (0, 1/4), and hence WN is a positive definite. matrix. Because CN (and hence its inverse) is positive definite by construction, and. because the sum of two positive definite matrices is also positive definite, we see. that the Hessian matrix A = −∇∇Ψ(aN ) is positive definite and so the posterior. distribution p(aN|tN ) is log convex and therefore has a single mode that is the global. Section 4.3.3. Exercise 6.24. 6.4. Gaussian Processes. 317. maximum. The posterior distribution is not Gaussian, however, because the Hessian. is a function of aN .. Using the Newton-Raphson formula (4.92), the iterative update equation for aN. is given by. N = CN (I + WN CN )−1 {tN − σN + WN aN} .. anew. (6.83). These equations are iterated until they converge to the mode which we denote by. N . At the mode, the gradient ∇Ψ(aN ) will vanish, and hence a. a. N will satisfy. N = CN (tN − σN ).. a. (6.84). Once we have found the mode a. N of the posterior, we can evaluate the Hessian. matrix given by. H = −∇∇Ψ(aN ) = WN + C−1. where the elements of WN are evaluated using a. proximation to the posterior distribution p(aN|tN ) given by. N. (6.85). N . This defines our Gaussian ap-. q(aN ) = N (aN|a. N , H−1).. (6.86). Exercise 6.25. Exercise 6.26. We can now combine this with (6.78) and hence evaluate the integral (6.77). Because. this corresponds to a linear-Gaussian model, we can use the general result (2.115) to. give. N + CN )−1k.. E[aN +1|tN ] = kT(tN − σN ). var[aN +1|tN ] = c − kT(W−1. (6.87). (6.88). Now that we have a Gaussian distribution for p(aN +1|tN ), we can approximate. the integral (6.76) using the result (4.153). As with the Bayesian logistic regression. model of Section 4.5, if we are only interested in the decision boundary correspond-. ing to p(tN +1|tN ) = 0.5, then we need only consider the mean and we can ignore. the effect of the variance.. We also need to determine the parameters θ of the covariance function. One. approach is to maximize the likelihood function given by p(tN|θ) for which we need. expressions for the log likelihood and its gradient. If desired, suitable regularization. terms can also be added, leading to a penalized maximum likelihood solution. The. likelihood function is defined by. p(tN|θ) =. p(tN|aN )p(aN|θ) daN .. (6.89). This integral is analytically intractable, so again we make use of the Laplace approx-. imation. Using the result (4.135), we obtain the following approximation for the log. of the likelihood function. ln p(tN|θ) = Ψ(a. N ) −. 1. 2. ln|WN + C−1. N | + N. 2. ln(2π). (6.90). N. ∂θj. N. 318. 6.

Note that changes in θ will. cause changes in a. N , leading to additional terms in the gradient. Thus, when we. differentiate (6.90) with respect to θ, we obtain two sets of terms, the first arising. from the dependence of the covariance matrix CN on θ, and the rest arising from. dependence of a. The terms arising from the explicit dependence on θ can be found by using. N on θ.. (6.80) together with the results (C.21) and (C.22), and are given by. ∂ ln p(tN|θ). 1. 2. N C−1. aT. N. C−1. N a.

We can illustrate the application of the Laplace approximation for Gaussian pro-. cesses using the synthetic two-class data set shown in Figure 6.12. Extension of the.

130,6.4.7,Connection to neural networks,"We have seen that the range of functions which can be represented by a neural. network is governed by the number M of hidden units, and that, for sufficiently. large M, a two-layer network can approximate any given function with arbitrary. accuracy.. In the framework of maximum likelihood, the number of hidden units. needs to be limited (to a level dependent on the size of the training set) in order. to avoid over-fitting. However, from a Bayesian perspective it makes little sense to. limit the number of parameters in the network according to the size of the training. set.. In a Bayesian neural network, the prior distribution over the parameter vector. w, in conjunction with the network function f(x, w), produces a prior distribution. over functions from y(x) where y is the vector of network outputs. Neal (1996). has shown that, for a broad class of prior distributions over w, the distribution of. functions generated by a neural network will tend to a Gaussian process in the limit. M → ∞. It should be noted, however, that in this limit the output variables of the. neural network become independent. One of the great merits of neural networks is. that the outputs share the hidden units and so they can ‘borrow statistical strength’. from each other, that is, the weights associated with each hidden unit are influenced. by all of the output variables not just by one of them. This property is therefore lost. in the Gaussian process limit.. We have seen that a Gaussian process is determined by its covariance (kernel). function. Williams (1998) has given explicit forms for the covariance in the case of. two specific choices for the hidden unit activation function (probit and Gaussian).. These kernel functions k(x, x) are nonstationary, i.e. they cannot be expressed as. a function of the difference x − x, as a consequence of the Gaussian weight prior. being centred on zero which breaks translation invariance in weight space.. 320. 6. KERNEL METHODS. Exercises. By working directly with the covariance function we have implicitly marginal-. ized over the distribution of weights. If the weight prior is governed by hyperpa-. rameters, then their values will determine the length scales of the distribution over. functions, as can be understood by studying the examples in Figure 5.11 for the case. of a finite number of hidden units. Note that we cannot marginalize out the hyperpa-. rameters analytically, and must instead resort to techniques of the kind discussed in.

131,7,Sparse Kernel Machines,"In the previous chapter, we explored a variety of learning algorithms based on non-. linear kernels. One of the significant limitations of many such algorithms is that. the kernel function k(xn, xm) must be evaluated for all possible pairs xn and xm. of training points, which can be computationally infeasible during training and can. lead to excessive computation times when making predictions for new data points.. In this chapter we shall look at kernel-based algorithms that have sparse solutions,. so that predictions for new inputs depend only on the kernel function evaluated at a. subset of the training data points.. We begin by looking in some detail at the support vector machine (SVM), which. became popular in some years ago for solving problems in classification, regression,. and novelty detection. An important property of support vector machines is that the. determination of the model parameters corresponds to a convex optimization prob-. lem, and so any local solution is also a global optimum. Because the discussion of. support vector machines makes extensive use of Lagrange multipliers, the reader is. 325. 326. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. encouraged to review the key concepts covered in Appendix E. Additional infor-. mation on support vector machines can be found in Vapnik (1995), Burges (1998),. Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor (2000), M¨uller et al. (2001), Sch¨olkopf and Smola. (2002), and Herbrich (2002).. The SVM is a decision machine and so does not provide posterior probabilities.. We have already discussed some of the benefits of determining probabilities in Sec-. tion 1.5.4. An alternative sparse kernel technique, known as the relevance vector. machine (RVM), is based on a Bayesian formulation and provides posterior proba-. bilistic outputs, as well as having typically much sparser solutions than the SVM.. Section 7.2. "
132,7.1,Maximum Margin Classifiers,"We begin our discussion of support vector machines by returning to the two-class. classification problem using linear models of the form. y(x) = wTφ(x) + b. (7.1). where φ(x) denotes a fixed feature-space transformation, and we have made the. bias parameter b explicit. Note that we shall shortly introduce a dual representation. expressed in terms of kernel functions, which avoids having to work explicitly in. feature space. The training data set comprises N input vectors x1, . . . , xN , with. corresponding target values t1, . . . , tN where tn ∈ {−1, 1}, and new data points x. are classified according to the sign of y(x).. We shall assume for the moment that the training data set is linearly separable in. feature space, so that by definition there exists at least one choice of the parameters. w and b such that a function of the form (7.1) satisfies y(xn) > 0 for points having. tn = +1 and y(xn) < 0 for points having tn = −1, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all. training data points.. There may of course exist many such solutions that separate the classes exactly.. In Section 4.1.7, we described the perceptron algorithm that is guaranteed to find. a solution in a finite number of steps. The solution that it finds, however, will be. dependent on the (arbitrary) initial values chosen for w and b as well as on the. order in which the data points are presented. If there are multiple solutions all of. which classify the training data set exactly, then we should try to find the one that. will give the smallest generalization error. The support vector machine approaches. this problem through the concept of the margin, which is defined to be the smallest. distance between the decision boundary and any of the samples, as illustrated in. Figure 7.1.. In support vector machines the decision boundary is chosen to be the one for. which the margin is maximized. The maximum margin solution can be motivated us-. ing computational learning theory, also known as statistical learning theory. How-. ever, a simple insight into the origins of maximum margin has been given by Tong. and Koller (2000) who consider a framework for classification based on a hybrid of. generative and discriminative approaches. They first model the distribution over in-. put vectors x for each class using a Parzen density estimator with Gaussian kernels. Section 7.1.5. 7.1.

Figure 7.1 The margin is defined as the perpendicular distance between the decision boundary and the closest. of the data points, as shown on the left figure. Maximizing the margin leads to a particular choice of decision. boundary, as shown on the right. The location of this boundary is determined by a subset of the data points,. known as support vectors, which are indicated by the circles.. having a common parameter σ2. Together with the class priors, this defines an opti-. mal misclassification-rate decision boundary. However, instead of using this optimal. boundary, they determine the best hyperplane by minimizing the probability of error. relative to the learned density model. In the limit σ2 → 0, the optimal hyperplane. is shown to be the one having maximum margin. The intuition behind this result is. that as σ2 is reduced, the hyperplane is increasingly dominated by nearby data points. relative to more distant ones. In the limit, the hyperplane becomes independent of. data points that are not support vectors.. We shall see in Figure 10.13 that marginalization with respect to the prior distri-. bution of the parameters in a Bayesian approach for a simple linearly separable data. set leads to a decision boundary that lies in the middle of the region separating the. data points. The large margin solution has similar behaviour.. Recall from Figure 4.1 that the perpendicular distance of a point x from a hyper-. plane defined by y(x) = 0 where y(x) takes the form (7.1) is given by |y(x)|/w.. Furthermore, we are only interested in solutions for which all data points are cor-. rectly classified, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all n. Thus the distance of a point xn to the. decision surface is given by. tny(xn). w. = tn(wTφ(xn) + b). w. (7.2). The margin is given by the perpendicular distance to the closest point xn from the. data set, and we wish to optimize the parameters w and b in order to maximize this. distance. Thus the maximum margin solution is found by solving. arg max. w,b. 1. w. min. n. tn. wTφ(xn) + b. (7.3). where we have taken the factor 1/w outside the optimization over n because w. n=1. n=1.

Direct solution of this optimization problem would be very. complex, and so we shall convert it into an equivalent problem that is much easier. to solve. To do this we note that if we make the rescaling w → κw and b → κb,. then the distance from any point xn to the decision surface, given by tny(xn)/w,. is unchanged. We can use this freedom to set. tn. wTφ(xn) + b. = 1. (7.4). tn. for the point that is closest to the surface. In this case, all data points will satisfy the. constraints. � 1,. n = 1, . . . , N.. wTφ(xn) + b. (7.5). This is known as the canonical representation of the decision hyperplane.. In the. case of data points for which the equality holds, the constraints are said to be active,. whereas for the remainder they are said to be inactive. By definition, there will. always be at least one active constraint, because there will always be a closest point,. and once the margin has been maximized there will be at least two active constraints.. The optimization problem then simply requires that we maximize w−1, which is. equivalent to minimizing w2, and so we have to solve the optimization problem. (7.6). arg min. 1. 2w2. w,b. subject to the constraints given by (7.5). The factor of 1/2 in (7.6) is included for. later convenience. This is an example of a quadratic programming problem in which. we are trying to minimize a quadratic function subject to a set of linear inequality. constraints. It appears that the bias parameter b has disappeared from the optimiza-. tion. However, it is determined implicitly via the constraints, because these require. that changes to w be compensated by changes to b. We shall see how this works. shortly.. In order to solve this constrained optimization problem, we introduce Lagrange. multipliers an � 0, with one multiplier an for each of the constraints in (7.5), giving. the Lagrangian function. L(w, b, a) =. 1. 2w2 −. an. tn(wTφ(xn) + b) − 1. (7.7). where a = (a1, . . . , aN )T. Note the minus sign in front of the Lagrange multiplier. term, because we are minimizing with respect to w and b, and maximizing with. respect to a. Setting the derivatives of L(w, b, a) with respect to w and b equal to. zero, we obtain the following two conditions. w =. antnφ(xn). 0 =. antn.. n=1. (7.8). (7.9). n=1. N. N. n=1. N. 1. 2. N.

Here the kernel function is defined by k(x, x) = φ(x)Tφ(x). Again, this takes the. form of a quadratic programming problem in which we optimize a quadratic function. of a subject to a set of inequality constraints. We shall discuss techniques for solving. such quadratic programming problems in Section 7.1.1.. The solution to a quadratic programming problem in M variables in general has. computational complexity that is O(M 3). In going to the dual formulation we have. turned the original optimization problem, which involved minimizing (7.6) over M. variables, into the dual problem (7.10), which has N variables. For a fixed set of. basis functions whose number M is smaller than the number N of data points, the. move to the dual problem appears disadvantageous. However, it allows the model to. be reformulated using kernels, and so the maximum margin classifier can be applied. efficiently to feature spaces whose dimensionality exceeds the number of data points,. including infinite feature spaces. The kernel formulation also makes clear the role. of the constraint that the kernel function k(x, x) be positive definite, because this. L(a) is bounded below, giving rise to a well-. ensures that the Lagrangian function. defined optimization problem.. In order to classify new data points using the trained model, we evaluate the sign. of y(x) defined by (7.1). This can be expressed in terms of the parameters {an} and. the kernel function by substituting for w using (7.8) to give. y(x) =. antnk(x, xn) + b.. (7.13). n=1. Joseph-Louis Lagrange. 1736–1813. Although widely considered to be. a French mathematician, Lagrange. was born in Turin in Italy. By the age. of nineteen, he had already made. important contributions mathemat-. ics and had been appointed as Pro-. fessor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. For many. years, Euler worked hard to persuade Lagrange to. move to Berlin, which he eventually did in 1766 where. he succeeded Euler as Director of Mathematics at. the Berlin Academy. Later he moved to Paris, nar-. rowly escaping with his life during the French revo-. lution thanks to the personal intervention of Lavoisier. (the French chemist who discovered oxygen) who him-. self was later executed at the guillotine. Lagrange. made key contributions to the calculus of variations. and the foundations of dynamics.. m∈S. n∈S. N. 330. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. In Appendix E, we show that a constrained optimization of this form satisfies the. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which in this case require that the following. three properties hold. an � 0. tny(xn) − 1 � 0. an {tny(xn) − 1} = 0.. (7.14). (7.15). (7.16). Thus for every data point, either an = 0 or tny(xn) = 1. Any data point for. which an = 0 will not appear in the sum in (7.13) and hence plays no role in making. predictions for new data points. The remaining data points are called support vectors,. and because they satisfy tny(xn) = 1, they correspond to points that lie on the. maximum margin hyperplanes in feature space, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. This. property is central to the practical applicability of support vector machines. Once. the model is trained, a significant proportion of the data points can be discarded and. only the support vectors retained.. Having solved the quadratic programming problem and found a value for a, we. can then determine the value of the threshold parameter b by noting that any support. vector xn satisfies tny(xn) = 1. Using (7.13) this gives. tn. amtmk(xn, xm) + b. = 1. (7.17). where S denotes the set of indices of the support vectors. Although we can solve. this equation for b using an arbitrarily chosen support vector xn, a numerically more. n = 1,. stable solution is obtained by first multiplying through by tn, making use of t2. and then averaging these equations over all support vectors and solving for b to give. b =. 1. NS. amtmk(xn, xm). (7.18). tn −. m∈S. where NS is the total number of support vectors.. For later comparison with alternative models, we can express the maximum-. margin classifier in terms of the minimization of an error function, with a simple. quadratic regularizer, in the form. E∞(y(xn)tn − 1) + λw2. n=1. (7.19). where E∞(z) is a function that is zero if z � 0 and ∞ otherwise and ensures that. the constraints (7.5) are satisfied. Note that as long as the regularization parameter. satisfies λ > 0, its precise value plays no role.. Figure 7.2 shows an example of the classification resulting from training a sup-. port vector machine on a simple synthetic data set using a Gaussian kernel of the. 7.1.

Although the data set is not linearly separable in the two-dimensional. data space x, it is linearly separable in the nonlinear feature space defined implicitly. by the nonlinear kernel function. Thus the training data points are perfectly separated. in the original data space.. This example also provides a geometrical insight into the origin of sparsity in. the SVM. The maximum margin hyperplane is defined by the location of the support. vectors. Other data points can be moved around freely (so long as they remain out-. side the margin region) without changing the decision boundary, and so the solution. will be independent of such data points.. "
133,7.1.1,Overlapping class distributions,"So far, we have assumed that the training data points are linearly separable in the. feature space φ(x). The resulting support vector machine will give exact separation. of the training data in the original input space x, although the corresponding decision. boundary will be nonlinear. In practice, however, the class-conditional distributions. may overlap, in which case exact separation of the training data can lead to poor. generalization.. We therefore need a way to modify the support vector machine so as to allow. some of the training points to be misclassified. From (7.19) we see that in the case. of separable classes, we implicitly used an error function that gave infinite error. if a data point was misclassified and zero error if it was classified correctly, and. then optimized the model parameters to maximize the margin. We now modify this. approach so that data points are allowed to be on the ‘wrong side’ of the margin. boundary, but with a penalty that increases with the distance from that boundary. For. the subsequent optimization problem, it is convenient to make this penalty a linear. function of this distance. To do this, we introduce slack variables, ξn � 0 where. n = 1, . . . , N, with one slack variable for each training data point (Bennett, 1992;. Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). These are defined by ξn = 0 for data points that are on or. inside the correct margin boundary and ξn = |tn − y(xn)| for other points. Thus a. data point that is on the decision boundary y(xn) = 0 will have ξn = 1, and points. 332. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. Figure 7.3 Illustration of the slack variables ξn � 0.. Data points with circles around them are. support vectors.. n=1. N. N. N. y = −1. y = 0. y = 1. ξ = 0. ξ > 1. ξ < 1. ξ = 0. N. with ξn > 1 will be misclassified. The exact classification constraints (7.5) are then. replaced with. n = 1, . . . , N. tny(xn) � 1 − ξn,. (7.20). in which the slack variables are constrained to satisfy ξn � 0. Data points for which. ξn = 0 are correctly classified and are either on the margin or on the correct side. of the margin. Points for which 0 < ξn � 1 lie inside the margin, but on the cor-. rect side of the decision boundary, and those data points for which ξn > 1 lie on. the wrong side of the decision boundary and are misclassified, as illustrated in Fig-. ure 7.3. This is sometimes described as relaxing the hard margin constraint to give a. soft margin and allows some of the training set data points to be misclassified. Note. that while slack variables allow for overlapping class distributions, this framework is. still sensitive to outliers because the penalty for misclassification increases linearly. with ξ.. Our goal is now to maximize the margin while softly penalizing points that lie. on the wrong side of the margin boundary. We therefore minimize. C. ξn +. 1. 2w2. (7.21). where the parameter C > 0 controls the trade-off between the slack variable penalty. and the margin. Because any point that is misclassified has ξn > 1, it follows that. n ξn is an upper bound on the number of misclassified points. The parameter C is. therefore analogous to (the inverse of) a regularization coefficient because it controls. the trade-off between minimizing training errors and controlling model complexity.. In the limit C → ∞, we will recover the earlier support vector machine for separable. data.. We now wish to minimize (7.21) subject to the constraints (7.20) together with. ξn � 0. The corresponding Lagrangian is given by. L(w, b, a) =. 1. 2w2 + C. ξn−. n=1. n=1. an {tny(xn) − 1 + ξn}−. n=1. µnξn (7.22). N. ∂L. ∂w. ∂L. ∂b. ∂L. ∂ξn. n=1. n=1. N. N. N. N. 1. 2. N. (7.23).

L(a) =. n=1. an −. anamtntmk(xn, xm). (7.32). n=1. m=1. which is identical to the separable case, except that the constraints are somewhat. different. To see what these constraints are, we note that an � 0 is required because. these are Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore, (7.31) together with µn � 0 implies. an � C. We therefore have to minimize (7.32) with respect to the dual variables. {an} subject to. 0 � an � C. antn = 0. n=1. for n = 1, . . . , N, where (7.33) are known as box constraints. This again represents. a quadratic programming problem. If we substitute (7.29) into (7.1), we see that. predictions for new data points are again made by using (7.13).. We can now interpret the resulting solution. As before, a subset of the data. points may have an = 0, in which case they do not contribute to the predictive.

These have. an > 0 and hence from (7.25) must satisfy. tny(xn) = 1 − ξn.. (7.35). If an < C, then (7.31) implies that µn > 0, which from (7.28) requires ξn = 0 and. hence such points lie on the margin. Points with an = C can lie inside the margin. and can either be correctly classified if ξn � 1 or misclassified if ξn > 1.. To determine the parameter b in (7.1), we note that those support vectors for. which 0 < an < C have ξn = 0 so that tny(xn) = 1 and hence will satisfy. tn. amtmk(xn, xm) + b. = 1.. (7.36). Again, a numerically stable solution is obtained by averaging to give. b =. 1. NM. amtmk(xn, xm). (7.37). m∈S. where M denotes the set of indices of data points having 0 < an < C.. An alternative, equivalent formulation of the support vector machine, known as. the ν-SVM, has been proposed by Sch¨olkopf et al. (2000). This involves maximizing. L(a) = −. anamtntmk(xn, xm). (7.38). subject to the constraints. (7.39). (7.40). (7.41). This approach has the advantage that the parameter ν, which replaces C, can be. interpreted as both an upper bound on the fraction of margin errors (points for which. ξn > 0 and hence which lie on the wrong side of the margin boundary and which may. or may not be misclassified) and a lower bound on the fraction of support vectors. An. example of the ν-SVM applied to a synthetic data set is shown in Figure 7.4. Here. Gaussian kernels of the form exp (−γx − x2) have been used, with γ = 0.45.. Although predictions for new inputs are made using only the support vectors,. the training phase (i.e., the determination of the parameters a and b) makes use of. the whole data set, and so it is important to have efficient algorithms for solving. 335. 7.1. Maximum Margin Classifiers. Figure 7.4 Illustration of the ν-SVM applied. to a nonseparable data set in two. dimensions. The support vectors. are indicated by circles.. 2. 0. −2. −2. 0. 2. L(a). the quadratic programming problem. We first note that the objective function. given by (7.10) or (7.32) is quadratic and so any local optimum will also be a global. optimum provided the constraints define a convex region (which they do as a conse-. quence of being linear). Direct solution of the quadratic programming problem us-. ing traditional techniques is often infeasible due to the demanding computation and. memory requirements, and so more practical approaches need to be found. The tech-. nique of chunking (Vapnik, 1982) exploits the fact that the value of the Lagrangian. is unchanged if we remove the rows and columns of the kernel matrix corresponding. to Lagrange multipliers that have value zero. This allows the full quadratic pro-. gramming problem to be broken down into a series of smaller ones, whose goal is. eventually to identify all of the nonzero Lagrange multipliers and discard the others.. Chunking can be implemented using protected conjugate gradients (Burges, 1998).. Although chunking reduces the size of the matrix in the quadratic function from the. number of data points squared to approximately the number of nonzero Lagrange. multipliers squared, even this may be too big to fit in memory for large-scale appli-. cations. Decomposition methods (Osuna et al., 1996) also solve a series of smaller. quadratic programming problems but are designed so that each of these is of a fixed. size, and so the technique can be applied to arbitrarily large data sets. However, it. still involves numerical solution of quadratic programming subproblems and these. can be problematic and expensive. One of the most popular approaches to training. support vector machines is called sequential minimal optimization, or SMO (Platt,. 1999). It takes the concept of chunking to the extreme limit and considers just two. Lagrange multipliers at a time. In this case, the subproblem can be solved analyti-. cally, thereby avoiding numerical quadratic programming altogether. Heuristics are. given for choosing the pair of Lagrange multipliers to be considered at each step.. In practice, SMO is found to have a scaling with the number of data points that is. somewhere between linear and quadratic depending on the particular application.. We have seen that kernel functions correspond to inner products in feature spaces. that can have high, or even infinite, dimensionality. By working directly in terms of. the kernel function, without introducing the feature space explicitly, it might there-. fore seem that support vector machines somehow manage to avoid the curse of di-. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. 336. Section 1.4. mensionality. This is not the case, however, because there are constraints amongst. the feature values that restrict the effective dimensionality of feature space. To see. this consider a simple second-order polynomial kernel that we can expand in terms. of its components. k(x, z) =. 1 + xTz. 2 = (1 + x1z1 + x2z2)2. = 1 + 2x1z1 + 2x2z2 + x2. = (1,√2x1,√2x2, x2. = φ(x)Tφ(z).. 1z2. 1 + 2x1z1x2z2 + x2. 1,√2x1x2, x2. 2)(1,√2z1,√2z2, z2. 2z2. 2. 1,√2z1z2, z2. 2)T. (7.42). This kernel function therefore represents an inner product in a feature space having. six dimensions, in which the mapping from input space to feature space is described. by the vector function φ(x). However, the coefficients weighting these different. features are constrained to have specific forms. Thus any set of points in the original. two-dimensional space x would be constrained to lie exactly on a two-dimensional. nonlinear manifold embedded in the six-dimensional feature space.. We have already highlighted the fact that the support vector machine does not. provide probabilistic outputs but instead makes classification decisions for new in-. put vectors. Veropoulos et al. (1999) discuss modifications to the SVM to allow. the trade-off between false positive and false negative errors to be controlled. How-. ever, if we wish to use the SVM as a module in a larger probabilistic system, then. probabilistic predictions of the class label t for new inputs x are required.. To address this issue, Platt (2000) has proposed fitting a logistic sigmoid to the. outputs of a previously trained support vector machine. Specifically, the required. conditional probability is assumed to be of the form. p(t = 1|x) = σ (Ay(x) + B). (7.43). where y(x) is defined by (7.1). Values for the parameters A and B are found by. minimizing the cross-entropy error function defined by a training set consisting of. pairs of values y(xn) and tn. The data used to fit the sigmoid needs to be independent. of that used to train the original SVM in order to avoid severe over-fitting. This two-. stage approach is equivalent to assuming that the output y(x) of the support vector. machine represents the log-odds of x belonging to class t = 1. Because the SVM. training procedure is not specifically intended to encourage this, the SVM can give. a poor approximation to the posterior probabilities (Tipping, 2001).. "
134,7.1.2,Relation to logistic regression,"As with the separable case, we can re-cast the SVM for nonseparable distri-. butions in terms of the minimization of a regularized error function. This will also. allow us to highlight similarities, and differences, compared to the logistic regression. model.. We have seen that for data points that are on the correct side of the margin. boundary, and which therefore satisfy yntn � 1, we have ξn = 0, and for the. Section 4.3.2. n=1. N. N. Figure 7.5 Plot of the ‘hinge’ error function used. in support vector machines, shown. in blue, along with the error function. for logistic regression, rescaled by a. factor of 1/ ln(2) so that it passes. through the point (0, 1), shown in red.. Also shown are the misclassification. error in black and the squared error. in green.. 7.1. Maximum Margin Classifiers. 337. E(z). −2. −1. 0. 1. z. 2. remaining points we have ξn = 1 − yntn. Thus the objective function (7.21) can be. written (up to an overall multiplicative constant) in the form. ESV(yntn) + λw2. (7.44). where λ = (2C)−1, and ESV(·) is the hinge error function defined by. ESV(yntn) = [1 − yntn]+. (7.45). where [· ]+ denotes the positive part. The hinge error function, so-called because. of its shape, is plotted in Figure 7.5. It can be viewed as an approximation to the. misclassification error, i.e., the error function that ideally we would like to minimize,. which is also shown in Figure 7.5.. When we considered the logistic regression model in Section 4.3.2, we found it. convenient to work with target variable t ∈ {0, 1}. For comparison with the support. vector machine, we first reformulate maximum likelihood logistic regression using. the target variable t ∈ {−1, 1}. To do this, we note that p(t = 1|y) = σ(y) where. y(x) is given by (7.1), and σ(y) is the logistic sigmoid function defined by (4.59). It. follows that p(t = −1|y) = 1 − σ(y) = σ(−y), where we have used the properties. of the logistic sigmoid function, and so we can write. p(t|y) = σ(yt).. (7.46). Exercise 7.6. From this we can construct an error function by taking the negative logarithm of the. likelihood function that, with a quadratic regularizer, takes the form. where. ELR(yntn) + λw2.. n=1. ELR(yt) = ln (1 + exp(−yt)) .. (7.47). (7.48). 338. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. For comparison with other error functions, we can divide by ln(2) so that the error. function passes through the point (0, 1). This rescaled error function is also plotted. in Figure 7.5 and we see that it has a similar form to the support vector error function.. The key difference is that the flat region in ESV(yt) leads to sparse solutions.. Both the logistic error and the hinge loss can be viewed as continuous approx-. imations to the misclassification error. Another continuous error function that has. sometimes been used to solve classification problems is the squared error, which. is again plotted in Figure 7.5. It has the property, however, of placing increasing. emphasis on data points that are correctly classified but that are a long way from. the decision boundary on the correct side. Such points will be strongly weighted at. the expense of misclassified points, and so if the objective is to minimize the mis-. classification rate, then a monotonically decreasing error function would be a better. choice.. "
135,7.1.3,Multiclass SVMs,"The support vector machine is fundamentally a two-class classifier. In practice,. however, we often have to tackle problems involving K > 2 classes. Various meth-. ods have therefore been proposed for combining multiple two-class SVMs in order. to build a multiclass classifier.. One commonly used approach (Vapnik, 1998) is to construct K separate SVMs,. in which the kth model yk(x) is trained using the data from class Ck as the positive. examples and the data from the remaining K − 1 classes as the negative examples.. This is known as the one-versus-the-rest approach. However, in Figure 4.2 we saw. that using the decisions of the individual classifiers can lead to inconsistent results. in which an input is assigned to multiple classes simultaneously. This problem is. sometimes addressed by making predictions for new inputs x using. y(x) = max. k. yk(x).. (7.49). Unfortunately, this heuristic approach suffers from the problem that the different. classifiers were trained on different tasks, and there is no guarantee that the real-. valued quantities yk(x) for different classifiers will have appropriate scales.. Another problem with the one-versus-the-rest approach is that the training sets. are imbalanced. For instance, if we have ten classes each with equal numbers of. training data points, then the individual classifiers are trained on data sets comprising. 90% negative examples and only 10% positive examples, and the symmetry of the. original problem is lost. A variant of the one-versus-the-rest scheme was proposed. by Lee et al. (2001) who modify the target values so that the positive class has target. +1 and the negative class has target −1/(K − 1).. Weston and Watkins (1999) define a single objective function for training all. K SVMs simultaneously, based on maximizing the margin from each to remaining. classes. However, this can result in much slower training because, instead of solving. K separate optimization problems each over N data points with an overall cost of. O(KN 2), a single optimization problem of size (K − 1)N must be solved giving an. overall cost of O(K 2N 2).. 7.1. Maximum Margin Classifiers. 339. Another approach is to train K(K −1)/2 different 2-class SVMs on all possible. pairs of classes, and then to classify test points according to which class has the high-. est number of ‘votes’, an approach that is sometimes called one-versus-one. Again,. we saw in Figure 4.2 that this can lead to ambiguities in the resulting classification.. Also, for large K this approach requires significantly more training time than the. one-versus-the-rest approach. Similarly, to evaluate test points, significantly more. computation is required.. The latter problem can be alleviated by organizing the pairwise classifiers into. a directed acyclic graph (not to be confused with a probabilistic graphical model). leading to the DAGSVM (Platt et al., 2000). For K classes, the DAGSVM has a total. of K(K − 1)/2 classifiers, and to classify a new test point only K − 1 pairwise. classifiers need to be evaluated, with the particular classifiers used depending on. which path through the graph is traversed.. A different approach to multiclass classification, based on error-correcting out-. put codes, was developed by Dietterich and Bakiri (1995) and applied to support. vector machines by Allwein et al. (2000). This can be viewed as a generalization of. the voting scheme of the one-versus-one approach in which more general partitions. of the classes are used to train the individual classifiers. The K classes themselves. are represented as particular sets of responses from the two-class classifiers chosen,. and together with a suitable decoding scheme, this gives robustness to errors and to. ambiguity in the outputs of the individual classifiers. Although the application of. SVMs to multiclass classification problems remains an open issue, in practice the. one-versus-the-rest approach is the most widely used in spite of its ad-hoc formula-. tion and its practical limitations.. There are also single-class support vector machines, which solve an unsuper-. vised learning problem related to probability density estimation. Instead of mod-. elling the density of data, however, these methods aim to find a smooth boundary. enclosing a region of high density. The boundary is chosen to represent a quantile of. the density, that is, the probability that a data point drawn from the distribution will. land inside that region is given by a fixed number between 0 and 1 that is specified in. advance. This is a more restricted problem than estimating the full density but may. be sufficient in specific applications. Two approaches to this problem using support. vector machines have been proposed. The algorithm of Sch¨olkopf et al. (2001) tries. to find a hyperplane that separates all but a fixed fraction ν of the training data from. the origin while at the same time maximizing the distance (margin) of the hyperplane. from the origin, while Tax and Duin (1999) look for the smallest sphere in feature. space that contains all but a fraction ν of the data points. For kernels k(x, x) that. are functions only of x − x, the two algorithms are equivalent.. "

The parameter b can be found by considering a data point for which 0 < an <. C, which from (7.67) must have ξn = 0, and from (7.65) must therefore satisfy. + yn − tn = 0.

As with the classification case, there is an alternative formulation of the SVM. for regression in which the parameter governing complexity has a more intuitive. interpretation (Sch¨olkopf et al., 2000).

137,7.1.5,Computational learning theory,"Historically, support vector machines have largely been motivated and analysed. using a theoretical framework known as computational learning theory, also some-. times called statistical learning theory (Anthony and Biggs, 1992; Kearns and Vazi-. rani, 1994; Vapnik, 1995; Vapnik, 1998). This has its origins with Valiant (1984). who formulated the probably approximately correct, or PAC, learning framework.. The goal of the PAC framework is to understand how large a data set needs to be in. order to give good generalization. It also gives bounds for the computational cost of. learning, although we do not consider these here.. Ex,t [I (f(x;D) = t)] <. Suppose that a data set D of size N is drawn from some joint distribution p(x, t). where x is the input variable and t represents the class label, and that we restrict. attention to ‘noise free’ situations in which the class labels are determined by some. (unknown) deterministic function t = g(x). In PAC learning we say that a function. f(x;D), drawn from a space F of such functions on the basis of the training set. D, has good generalization if its expected error rate is below some pre-specified. threshold 	, so that. (7.75). where I(·) is the indicator function, and the expectation is with respect to the dis-. tribution p(x, t). The quantity on the left-hand side is a random variable, because. it depends on the training set D, and the PAC framework requires that (7.75) holds,. with probability greater than 1 − δ, for a data set D drawn randomly from p(x, t).. Here δ is another pre-specified parameter, and the terminology ‘probably approxi-. mately correct’ comes from the requirement that with high probability (greater than. 1− δ), the error rate be small (less than 	). For a given choice of model space F, and. for given parameters 	 and δ, PAC learning aims to provide bounds on the minimum. size N of data set needed to meet this criterion. A key quantity in PAC learning is. the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension, which provides a measure of. the complexity of a space of functions, and which allows the PAC framework to be. extended to spaces containing an infinite number of functions.. The bounds derived within the PAC framework are often described as worst-. "
138,7.2,Relevance Vector Machines,"345. case, because they apply to any choice for the distribution p(x, t), so long as both. the training and the test examples are drawn (independently) from the same distribu-. tion, and for any choice for the function f(x) so long as it belongs to F. In real-world. applications of machine learning, we deal with distributions that have significant reg-. ularity, for example in which large regions of input space carry the same class label.. As a consequence of the lack of any assumptions about the form of the distribution,. the PAC bounds are very conservative, in other words they strongly over-estimate. the size of data sets required to achieve a given generalization performance. For this. reason, PAC bounds have found few, if any, practical applications.. One attempt to improve the tightness of the PAC bounds is the PAC-Bayesian. framework (McAllester, 2003), which considers a distribution over the space F of. functions, somewhat analogous to the prior in a Bayesian treatment. This still con-. siders any possible choice for p(x, t), and so although the bounds are tighter, they. are still very conservative.. 7.2. Relevance Vector Machines. Support vector machines have been used in a variety of classification and regres-. sion applications. Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of limitations, several. of which have been highlighted already in this chapter. In particular, the outputs of. an SVM represent decisions rather than posterior probabilities. Also, the SVM was. originally formulated for two classes, and the extension to K > 2 classes is prob-. lematic. There is a complexity parameter C, or ν (as well as a parameter 	 in the case. of regression), that must be found using a hold-out method such as cross-validation.. Finally, predictions are expressed as linear combinations of kernel functions that are. centred on training data points and that are required to be positive definite.. The relevance vector machine or RVM (Tipping, 2001) is a Bayesian sparse ker-. nel technique for regression and classification that shares many of the characteristics. of the SVM whilst avoiding its principal limitations. Additionally, it typically leads. to much sparser models resulting in correspondingly faster performance on test data. whilst maintaining comparable generalization error.. In contrast to the SVM we shall find it more convenient to introduce the regres-. sion form of the RVM first and then consider the extension to classification tasks.. "
139,7.2.1,RVM for regression,"The relevance vector machine for regression is a linear model of the form studied. in Chapter 3 but with a modified prior that results in sparse solutions. The model. defines a conditional distribution for a real-valued target variable t, given an input. vector x, which takes the form. p(t|x, w, β) = N (t|y(x), β−1). (7.76). n=1. i=1. M. N. N. M. with fixed nonlinear basis functions φi(x), which will typically include a constant. term so that the corresponding weight parameter represents a ‘bias’.. The relevance vector machine is a specific instance of this model, which is in-. tended to mirror the structure of the support vector machine. In particular, the basis. functions are given by kernels, with one kernel associated with each of the data. points from the training set. The general expression (7.77) then takes the SVM-like. form. y(x) =. wnk(x, xn) + b. (7.78). where b is a bias parameter. The number of parameters in this case is M = N + 1,. and y(x) has the same form as the predictive model (7.64) for the SVM, except that. the coefficients an are here denoted wn. It should be emphasized that the subsequent. analysis is valid for arbitrary choices of basis function, and for generality we shall. work with the form (7.77). In contrast to the SVM, there is no restriction to positive-. definite kernels, nor are the basis functions tied in either number or location to the. training data points.. Suppose we are given a set of N observations of the input vector x, which we. n with n = 1, . . . , N. The. denote collectively by a data matrix X whose nth row is xT. corresponding target values are given by t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. Thus, the likelihood. function is given by. p(t|X, w, β) =. p(tn|xn, w, β−1).. (7.79). n=1. Next we introduce a prior distribution over the parameter vector w and as in. Chapter 3, we shall consider a zero-mean Gaussian prior. However, the key differ-. ence in the RVM is that we introduce a separate hyperparameter αi for each of the. weight parameters wi instead of a single shared hyperparameter. Thus the weight. prior takes the form. p(w|α) =. i=1. N (wi|0, α−1. i ). (7.80). where αi represents the precision of the corresponding parameter wi, and α denotes. (α1, . . . , αM )T. We shall see that, when we maximize the evidence with respect. to these hyperparameters, a significant proportion of them go to infinity, and the. corresponding weight parameters have posterior distributions that are concentrated. at zero. The basis functions associated with these parameters therefore play no role. 346. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. where β = σ−2 is the noise precision (inverse noise variance), and the mean is given. by a linear model of the form. y(x) =. wiφi(x) = wTφ(x). (7.77). 7.2. Relevance Vector Machines. 347. in the predictions made by the model and so are effectively pruned out, resulting in. a sparse model.. Using the result (3.49) for linear regression models, we see that the posterior. distribution for the weights is again Gaussian and takes the form. p(w|t, X, α, β) = N (w|m, Σ). (7.81). where the mean and covariance are given by. A + βΦTΦ. m = βΣΦTt. (7.82). (7.83). where Φ is the N × M design matrix with elements Φni = φi(xn), and A =. diag(αi). Note that in the specific case of the model (7.78), we have Φ = K, where. K is the symmetric (N + 1) × (N + 1) kernel matrix with elements k(xn, xm).. The values of α and β are determined using type-2 maximum likelihood, also. known as the evidence approximation, in which we maximize the marginal likeli-. hood function obtained by integrating out the weight parameters. −1. p(t|X, α, β) =. p(t|X, w, β)p(w|α) dw.. (7.84). Because this represents the convolution of two Gaussians, it is readily evaluated to. give the log marginal likelihood in the form. ln p(t|X, α, β) = lnN (t|0, C). 1. 2. N ln(2π) + ln|C| + tTC−1t. where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T, and we have defined the N × N matrix C given by. C = β−1I + ΦA−1ΦT.. Our goal is now to maximize (7.85) with respect to the hyperparameters α and. β. This requires only a small modification to the results obtained in Section 3.5 for. the evidence approximation in the linear regression model. Again, we can identify. two approaches. In the first, we simply set the required derivatives of the marginal. likelihood to zero and obtain the following re-estimation equations. (7.85). (7.86). (7.87). (7.88). αnew. i. = γi. m2. i.

The. quantity γi measures how well the corresponding parameter wi is determined by the. data and is defined by. 348. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. γi = 1 − αiΣii. (7.89). in which Σii is the ith diagonal component of the posterior covariance Σ given by. (7.83). Learning therefore proceeds by choosing initial values for α and β, evalu-. ating the mean and covariance of the posterior using (7.82) and (7.83), respectively,. and then alternately re-estimating the hyperparameters, using (7.87) and (7.88), and. re-estimating the posterior mean and covariance, using (7.82) and (7.83), until a suit-. able convergence criterion is satisfied.. The second approach is to use the EM algorithm, and is discussed in Sec-. tion 9.3.4. These two approaches to finding the values of the hyperparameters that. maximize the evidence are formally equivalent. Numerically, however, it is found. that the direct optimization approach corresponding to (7.87) and (7.88) gives some-. what faster convergence (Tipping, 2001).. As a result of the optimization, we find that a proportion of the hyperparameters. {αi} are driven to large (in principle infinite) values, and so the weight parameters. wi corresponding to these hyperparameters have posterior distributions with mean. and variance both zero. Thus those parameters, and the corresponding basis func-. tions φi(x), are removed from the model and play no role in making predictions for. new inputs. In the case of models of the form (7.78), the inputs xn corresponding to. the remaining nonzero weights are called relevance vectors, because they are iden-. tified through the mechanism of automatic relevance determination, and are analo-. gous to the support vectors of an SVM. It is worth emphasizing, however, that this. mechanism for achieving sparsity in probabilistic models through automatic rele-. vance determination is quite general and can be applied to any model expressed as. an adaptive linear combination of basis functions.. Having found values α and β for the hyperparameters that maximize the. marginal likelihood, we can evaluate the predictive distribution over t for a new. input x. Using (7.76) and (7.81), this is given by. p(t|x, X, t, α, β) =. = N. p(t|x, w, β)p(w|X, t, α, β) dw. t|mTφ(x), σ2(x). (7.90). Thus the predictive mean is given by (7.76) with w set equal to the posterior mean. m, and the variance of the predictive distribution is given by. σ2(x) = (β)−1 + φ(x)TΣφ(x). (7.91). where Σ is given by (7.83) in which α and β are set to their optimized values α and. β. This is just the familiar result (3.59) obtained in the context of linear regression.. Recall that for localized basis functions, the predictive variance for linear regression. models becomes small in regions of input space where there are no basis functions.. In the case of an RVM with the basis functions centred on data points, the model will. therefore become increasingly certain of its predictions when extrapolating outside. the domain of the data (Rasmussen and Qui˜nonero-Candela, 2005), which of course. is undesirable. The predictive distribution in Gaussian process regression does not. Exercise 9.23. Section 7.2.2. Exercise 7.14. Section 6.4.2. 7.2. Relevance Vector Machines. 349.

However, the computational cost of making predictions. with a Gaussian processes is typically much higher than with an RVM.. Figure 7.9 shows an example of the RVM applied to the sinusoidal regression. data set. Here the noise precision parameter β is also determined through evidence. maximization. We see that the number of relevance vectors in the RVM is signif-. icantly smaller than the number of support vectors used by the SVM. For a wide. range of regression and classification tasks, the RVM is found to give models that. are typically an order of magnitude more compact than the corresponding support. vector machine, resulting in a significant improvement in the speed of processing on. test data. Remarkably, this greater sparsity is achieved with little or no reduction in. generalization error compared with the corresponding SVM.. The principal disadvantage of the RVM compared to the SVM is that training. involves optimizing a nonconvex function, and training times can be longer than for a. comparable SVM. For a model with M basis functions, the RVM requires inversion. of a matrix of size M × M, which in general requires O(M 3) computation. In the. specific case of the SVM-like model (7.78), we have M = N +1. As we have noted,. there are techniques for training SVMs whose cost is roughly quadratic in N. Of. course, in the case of the RVM we always have the option of starting with a smaller. number of basis functions than N + 1. More significantly, in the relevance vector. machine the parameters governing complexity and noise variance are determined. automatically from a single training run, whereas in the support vector machine the. parameters C and 	 (or ν) are generally found using cross-validation, which involves. multiple training runs. Furthermore, in the next section we shall derive an alternative. procedure for training the relevance vector machine that improves training speed. significantly.. "
140,7.2.2,Analysis of sparsity,"We have noted earlier that the mechanism of automatic relevance determination. causes a subset of parameters to be driven to zero. We now examine in more detail. 350. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. t2. C. t. t1. t2. C. t. t1. Figure 7.10 Illustration of the mechanism for sparsity in a Bayesian linear regression model, showing a training. set vector of target values given by t = (t1, t2)T, indicated by the cross, for a model with one basis vector. ϕ = (φ(x1), φ(x2))T, which is poorly aligned with the target data vector t. On the left we see a model having. only isotropic noise, so that C = β−1I, corresponding to α = ∞, with β set to its most probable value. On. the right we see the same model but with a finite value of α. In each case the red ellipse corresponds to unit. Mahalanobis distance, with |C| taking the same value for both plots, while the dashed green circle shows the. contrition arising from the noise term β−1. We see that any finite value of α reduces the probability of the. observed data, and so for the most probable solution the basis vector is removed.. the mechanism of sparsity in the context of the relevance vector machine. In the. process, we will arrive at a significantly faster procedure for optimizing the hyper-. parameters compared to the direct techniques given above.. Before proceeding with a mathematical analysis, we first give some informal. insight into the origin of sparsity in Bayesian linear models. Consider a data set. comprising N = 2 observations t1 and t2, together with a model having a single. basis function φ(x), with hyperparameter α, along with isotropic noise having pre-. cision β. From (7.85), the marginal likelihood is given by p(t|α, β) = N (t|0, C) in. which the covariance matrix takes the form. C =. 1. I +. 1. ϕϕT. (7.92). where ϕ denotes the N-dimensional vector (φ(x1), φ(x2))T, and similarly t =. (t1, t2)T. Notice that this is just a zero-mean Gaussian process model over t with. covariance C. Given a particular observation for t, our goal is to find α and β by. maximizing the marginal likelihood. We see from Figure 7.10 that, if there is a poor. alignment between the direction of ϕ and that of the training data vector t, then the. corresponding hyperparameter α will be driven to ∞, and the basis vector will be. pruned from the model. This arises because any finite value for α will always assign. a lower probability to the data, thereby decreasing the value of the density at t, pro-. vided that β is set to its optimal value. We see that any finite value for α would cause. the distribution to be elongated in a direction away from the data, thereby increasing. the probability mass in regions away from the observed data and hence reducing the. value of the density at the target data vector itself. For the more general case of M. 7.2. Relevance Vector Machines. 351. basis vectors ϕ1, . . . , ϕM a similar intuition holds, namely that if a particular basis. vector is poorly aligned with the data vector t, then it is likely to be pruned from the. model.. We now investigate the mechanism for sparsity from a more mathematical per-. spective, for a general case involving M basis functions. To motivate this analysis. we first note that, in the result (7.87) for re-estimating the parameter αi, the terms on. the right-hand side are themselves also functions of αi. These results therefore rep-. resent implicit solutions, and iteration would be required even to determine a single. αi with all other αj for j = i fixed.. This suggests a different approach to solving the optimization problem for the. RVM, in which we make explicit all of the dependence of the marginal likelihood. (7.85) on a particular αi and then determine its stationary points explicitly (Faul and. Tipping, 2002; Tipping and Faul, 2003). To do this, we first pull out the contribution. from αi in the matrix C defined by (7.86) to give.

The ‘sparsity’ measures the extent to. which basis function ϕi overlaps with the other basis vectors in the model, and the. ‘quality’ represents a measure of the alignment of the basis vector ϕn with the error. between the training set values t = (t1, . . . , tN )T and the vector y. −i of predictions. that would result from the model with the vector ϕi excluded (Tipping and Faul,. 2003)..

Note that this approach has yielded a closed-form solution for αi, for given. values of the other hyperparameters. As well as providing insight into the origin of. sparsity in the RVM, this analysis also leads to a practical algorithm for optimizing. the hyperparameters that has significant speed advantages. This uses a fixed set. of candidate basis vectors, and then cycles through them in turn to decide whether. each vector should be included in the model or not. The resulting sequential sparse.

141,7.2.3,RVM for classification,"We can extend the relevance vector machine framework to classification prob-. lems by applying the ARD prior over weights to a probabilistic linear classification. model of the kind studied in Chapter 4. To start with, we consider two-class prob-. lems with a binary target variable t ∈ {0, 1}. The model now takes the form of a. linear combination of basis functions transformed by a logistic sigmoid function. y(x, w) = σ. wTφ(x). (7.108). n=1. 7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES. 354. Section 4.4. where σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid function defined by (4.59).. If we introduce a. Gaussian prior over the weight vector w, then we obtain the model that has been. considered already in Chapter 4. The difference here is that in the RVM, this model. uses the ARD prior (7.80) in which there is a separate precision hyperparameter. associated with each weight parameter.. In contrast to the regression model, we can no longer integrate analytically over. the parameter vector w. Here we follow Tipping (2001) and use the Laplace ap-. proximation, which was applied to the closely related problem of Bayesian logistic. regression in Section 4.5.1.. We begin by initializing the hyperparameter vector α. For this given value of. α, we then build a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution and thereby. obtain an approximation to the marginal likelihood. Maximization of this approxi-. mate marginal likelihood then leads to a re-estimated value for α, and the process is. repeated until convergence.. Let us consider the Laplace approximation for this model in more detail. For. a fixed value of α, the mode of the posterior distribution over w is obtained by. maximizing. ln p(w|t, α) = ln{p(t|w)p(w|α)} − ln p(t|α). 1. {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)} −. 2.

(7.111). where B is an N × N diagonal matrix with elements bn = yn(1 − yn), the vector. y = (y1, . . . , yN )T, and Φ is the design matrix with elements Φni = φi(xn). Here. we have used the property (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function.. At convergence of the IRLS algorithm, the negative Hessian represents the inverse. covariance matrix for the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution.. The mode of the resulting approximation to the posterior distribution, corre-. sponding to the mean of the Gaussian approximation, is obtained setting (7.110) to. zero, giving the mean and covariance of the Laplace approximation in the form. w = A−1ΦT(t − y). −1.

This takes the same form as (7.85) in the regression case, and so we can apply the. same analysis of sparsity and obtain the same fast learning algorithm in which we. fully optimize a single hyperparameter αi at each step.. Figure 7.12 shows the relevance vector machine applied to a synthetic classifi-. cation data set. We see that the relevance vectors tend not to lie in the region of the. decision boundary, in contrast to the support vector machine. This is consistent with. our earlier discussion of sparsity in the RVM, because a basis function φi(x) centred. on a data point near the boundary will have a vector ϕi that is poorly aligned with. the training data vector t.. One of the potential advantages of the relevance vector machine compared with. the SVM is that it makes probabilistic predictions. For example, this allows the RVM. to be used to help construct an emission density in a nonlinear extension of the linear. dynamical system for tracking faces in video sequences (Williams et al., 2005).. So far, we have considered the RVM for binary classification problems. For. K > 2 classes, we again make use of the probabilistic approach in Section 4.3.4 in. which there are K linear models of the form. ak = wT. k x. (7.120). exp(ak). j. N. K. (7.121). (7.122). The log likelihood function is then given by. ln p(T|w1, . . . , wK) =. ytnk. nk. n=1. k=1. where the target values tnk have a 1-of-K coding for each data point n, and T is a. matrix with elements tnk. Again, the Laplace approximation can be used to optimize. the hyperparameters (Tipping, 2001), in which the model and its Hessian are found. using IRLS. This gives a more principled approach to multiclass classification than. the pairwise method used in the support vector machine and also provides probabilis-. tic predictions for new data points. The principal disadvantage is that the Hessian. matrix has size M K×M K, where M is the number of active basis functions, which. gives an additional factor of K 3 in the computational cost of training compared with. the two-class RVM.. The principal disadvantage of the relevance vector machine is the relatively long. training times compared with the SVM. This is offset, however, by the avoidance of. cross-validation runs to set the model complexity parameters. Furthermore, because. it yields sparser models, the computation time on test points, which is usually the. more important consideration in practice, is typically much less.. 356. 7.

142,8,Graphical Models,"Probabilities play a central role in modern pattern recognition. We have seen in. Chapter 1 that probability theory can be expressed in terms of two simple equations. corresponding to the sum rule and the product rule. All of the probabilistic infer-. ence and learning manipulations discussed in this book, no matter how complex,. amount to repeated application of these two equations. We could therefore proceed. to formulate and solve complicated probabilistic models purely by algebraic ma-. nipulation. However, we shall find it highly advantageous to augment the analysis. using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called probabilistic. graphical models. These offer several useful properties:. 1. They provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model. and can be used to design and motivate new models.. 2. Insights into the properties of the model, including conditional independence. properties, can be obtained by inspection of the graph.. 359. 360. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. 3. Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophis-. ticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which. underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.. A graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known. as edges or arcs). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random. variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relation-. ships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint. distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of. factors each depending only on a subset of the variables. We shall begin by dis-. cussing Bayesian networks, also known as directed graphical models, in which the. links of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other. major class of graphical models are Markov random fields, also known as undirected. graphical models, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional. significance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between. random variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft con-. straints between random variables. For the purposes of solving inference problems,. it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different. representation called a factor graph.. In this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed. for applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. More general treat-. ments of graphical models can be found in the books by Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen. (1996), Jensen (1996), Castillo et al. (1997), Jordan (1999), Cowell et al. (1999),. and Jordan (2007).. "
143,8.1,Bayesian Networks,"In order to motivate the use of directed graphs to describe probability distributions,. consider first an arbitrary joint distribution p(a, b, c) over three variables a, b, and c.. Note that at this stage, we do not need to specify anything further about these vari-. ables, such as whether they are discrete or continuous. Indeed, one of the powerful. aspects of graphical models is that a specific graph can make probabilistic statements. for a broad class of distributions. By application of the product rule of probability. (1.11), we can write the joint distribution in the form. p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(a, b).. (8.1). A second application of the product rule, this time to the second term on the right-. hand side of (8.1), gives. p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(b|a)p(a).. (8.2). Note that this decomposition holds for any choice of the joint distribution. We now. represent the right-hand side of (8.2) in terms of a simple graphical model as follows.. First we introduce a node for each of the random variables a, b, and c and associate. each node with the corresponding conditional distribution on the right-hand side of. Figure 8.1 A directed graphical model representing the joint probabil-. ity distribution over three variables a, b, and c, correspond-. ing to the decomposition on the right-hand side of (8.2).. a. b. 8.1. Bayesian Networks. 361. c. (8.2). Then, for each conditional distribution we add directed links (arrows) to the. graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on which the distribution is. conditioned. Thus for the factor p(c|a, b), there will be links from nodes a and b to. node c, whereas for the factor p(a) there will be no incoming links. The result is the. graph shown in Figure 8.1. If there is a link going from a node a to a node b, then we. say that node a is the parent of node b, and we say that node b is the child of node a.. Note that we shall not make any formal distinction between a node and the variable. to which it corresponds but will simply use the same symbol to refer to both.. An interesting point to note about (8.2) is that the left-hand side is symmetrical. with respect to the three variables a, b, and c, whereas the right-hand side is not.. Indeed, in making the decomposition in (8.2), we have implicitly chosen a particular. ordering, namely a, b, c, and had we chosen a different ordering we would have. obtained a different decomposition and hence a different graphical representation.. We shall return to this point later.. For the moment let us extend the example of Figure 8.1 by considering the joint. distribution over K variables given by p(x1, . . . , xK). By repeated application of. the product rule of probability, this joint distribution can be written as a product of. conditional distributions, one for each of the variables. p(x1, . . . , xK) = p(xK|x1, . . . , xK−1) . . . p(x2|x1)p(x1).. (8.3). For a given choice of K, we can again represent this as a directed graph having K. nodes, one for each conditional distribution on the right-hand side of (8.3), with each. node having incoming links from all lower numbered nodes. We say that this graph. is fully connected because there is a link between every pair of nodes.. So far, we have worked with completely general joint distributions, so that the. decompositions, and their representations as fully connected graphs, will be applica-. ble to any choice of distribution. As we shall see shortly, it is the absence of links. in the graph that conveys interesting information about the properties of the class of. distributions that the graph represents. Consider the graph shown in Figure 8.2. This. is not a fully connected graph because, for instance, there is no link from x1 to x2 or. from x3 to x7.. We shall now go from this graph to the corresponding representation of the joint. probability distribution written in terms of the product of a set of conditional dis-. tributions, one for each node in the graph. Each such conditional distribution will. be conditioned only on the parents of the corresponding node in the graph. For in-. stance, x5 will be conditioned on x1 and x3. The joint distribution of all 7 variables. K. is therefore given by. p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x4|x1, x2, x3)p(x5|x1, x3)p(x6|x4)p(x7|x4, x5).. (8.4). The reader should take a moment to study carefully the correspondence between. (8.4) and Figure 8.2.. We can now state in general terms the relationship between a given directed. graph and the corresponding distribution over the variables. The joint distribution. defined by a graph is given by the product, over all of the nodes of the graph, of. a conditional distribution for each node conditioned on the variables corresponding. to the parents of that node in the graph. Thus, for a graph with K nodes, the joint. distribution is given by. 362. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.2 Example of a directed acyclic graph describing the joint. distribution over variables x1, . . . , x7. The corresponding. decomposition of the joint distribution is given by (8.4).. x1. x2. x4. x3. x5. x6. x7. Exercise 8.1. Exercise 8.2. p(x) =. p(xk|pak). k=1. (8.5). where pak denotes the set of parents of xk, and x = {x1, . . . , xK}. This key. equation expresses the factorization properties of the joint distribution for a directed. graphical model. Although we have considered each node to correspond to a single. variable, we can equally well associate sets of variables and vector-valued variables. with the nodes of a graph. It is easy to show that the representation on the right-. hand side of (8.5) is always correctly normalized provided the individual conditional. distributions are normalized.. The directed graphs that we are considering are subject to an important restric-. tion namely that there must be no directed cycles, in other words there are no closed. paths within the graph such that we can move from node to node along links follow-. ing the direction of the arrows and end up back at the starting node. Such graphs are. also called directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. This is equivalent to the statement that. there exists an ordering of the nodes such that there are no links that go from any. node to any lower numbered node.. "
144,8.1.1,Example: Polynomial regression,"As an illustration of the use of directed graphs to describe probability distri-. butions, we consider the Bayesian polynomial regression model introduced in Sec-. N. N. Figure 8.3 Directed graphical model representing the joint. distribution (8.6) corresponding to the Bayesian. polynomial regression model. introduced in Sec-. tion 1.2.6.. 8.1. Bayesian Networks. w. t1. 363. tN. (8.6). tion 1.2.6. The random variables in this model are the vector of polynomial coeffi-. cients w and the observed data t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. In addition, this model contains. the input data x = (x1, . . . , xN )T, the noise variance σ2, and the hyperparameter α. representing the precision of the Gaussian prior over w, all of which are parameters. of the model rather than random variables. Focussing just on the random variables. for the moment, we see that the joint distribution is given by the product of the prior. p(w) and N conditional distributions p(tn|w) for n = 1, . . . , N so that. p(t, w) = p(w). p(tn|w).. n=1. This joint distribution can be represented by a graphical model shown in Figure 8.3.. When we start to deal with more complex models later in the book, we shall find. it inconvenient to have to write out multiple nodes of the form t1, . . . , tN explicitly as. in Figure 8.3. We therefore introduce a graphical notation that allows such multiple. nodes to be expressed more compactly, in which we draw a single representative. node tn and then surround this with a box, called a plate, labelled with N indicating. that there are N nodes of this kind. Re-writing the graph of Figure 8.3 in this way,. we obtain the graph shown in Figure 8.4.. We shall sometimes find it helpful to make the parameters of a model, as well as. its stochastic variables, explicit. In this case, (8.6) becomes. p(t, w|x, α, σ2) = p(w|α). p(tn|w, xn, σ2).. n=1. Correspondingly, we can make x and α explicit in the graphical representation. To. do this, we shall adopt the convention that random variables will be denoted by open. circles, and deterministic parameters will be denoted by smaller solid circles. If we. take the graph of Figure 8.4 and include the deterministic parameters, we obtain the. graph shown in Figure 8.5.. When we apply a graphical model to a problem in machine learning or pattern. recognition, we will typically set some of the random variables to specific observed.

In a graphical model, we will denote such observed variables by shad-. ing the corresponding nodes. Thus the graph corresponding to Figure 8.5 in which. the variables {tn} are observed is shown in Figure 8.6. Note that the value of w is. not observed, and so w is an example of a latent variable, also known as a hidden. variable. Such variables play a crucial role in many probabilistic models and will. form the focus of Chapters 9 and 12.. Having observed the values {tn} we can, if desired, evaluate the posterior dis-. tribution of the polynomial coefficients w as discussed in Section 1.2.5.

145,8.1.2,Generative models,"There are many situations in which we wish to draw samples from a given prob-. ability distribution. Although we shall devote the whole of Chapter 11 to a detailed. discussion of sampling methods, it is instructive to outline here one technique, called. ancestral sampling, which is particularly relevant to graphical models. Consider a. joint distribution p(x1, . . . , xK) over K variables that factorizes according to (8.5). corresponding to a directed acyclic graph. We shall suppose that the variables have. been ordered such that there are no links from any node to any lower numbered node,. in other words each node has a higher number than any of its parents. Our goal is to. draw a sample. xK from the joint distribution.. x1, . . . ,. To do this, we start with the lowest-numbered node and draw a sample from the. distribution p(x1), which we call. x1. We then work through each of the nodes in or-. der, so that for node n we draw a sample from the conditional distribution p(xn|pan). in which the parent variables have been set to their sampled values. Note that at each. stage, these parent values will always be available because they correspond to lower-. numbered nodes that have already been sampled. Techniques for sampling from. specific distributions will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Once we have sam-. pled from the final variable xK, we will have achieved our objective of obtaining a. sample from the joint distribution. To obtain a sample from some marginal distribu-. tion corresponding to a subset of the variables, we simply take the sampled values. for the required nodes and ignore the sampled values for the remaining nodes. For. example, to draw a sample from the distribution p(x2, x4), we simply sample from. x4 and discard the remaining. the full joint distribution and then retain the values. values {. xj=2,4}.. x2,. 366. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.8 A graphical model representing the process by which. images of objects are created, in which the identity. of an object (a discrete variable) and the position and. orientation of that object (continuous variables) have. independent prior probabilities. The image (a vector. of pixel intensities) has a probability distribution that. is dependent on the identity of the object as well as. on its position and orientation.. Object. Position. Orientation. Image. For practical applications of probabilistic models, it will typically be the higher-. numbered variables corresponding to terminal nodes of the graph that represent the. observations, with lower-numbered nodes corresponding to latent variables. The. primary role of the latent variables is to allow a complicated distribution over the. observed variables to be represented in terms of a model constructed from simpler. (typically exponential family) conditional distributions.. We can interpret such models as expressing the processes by which the observed. data arose. For instance, consider an object recognition task in which each observed. data point corresponds to an image (comprising a vector of pixel intensities) of one. of the objects. In this case, the latent variables might have an interpretation as the. position and orientation of the object. Given a particular observed image, our goal is. to find the posterior distribution over objects, in which we integrate over all possible. positions and orientations. We can represent this problem using a graphical model. of the form show in Figure 8.8.. The graphical model captures the causal process (Pearl, 1988) by which the ob-. served data was generated. For this reason, such models are often called generative. models. By contrast, the polynomial regression model described by Figure 8.5 is. not generative because there is no probability distribution associated with the input. variable x, and so it is not possible to generate synthetic data points from this model.. We could make it generative by introducing a suitable prior distribution p(x), at the. expense of a more complex model.. The hidden variables in a probabilistic model need not, however, have any ex-. plicit physical interpretation but may be introduced simply to allow a more complex. joint distribution to be constructed from simpler components.. In either case, the. technique of ancestral sampling applied to a generative model mimics the creation. of the observed data and would therefore give rise to ‘fantasy’ data whose probability. distribution (if the model were a perfect representation of reality) would be the same. as that of the observed data. In practice, producing synthetic observations from a. generative model can prove informative in understanding the form of the probability. distribution represented by that model.. "
146,8.1.3,Discrete variables,"We have discussed the importance of probability distributions that are members. of the exponential family, and we have seen that this family includes many well-. known distributions as particular cases. Although such distributions are relatively. simple, they form useful building blocks for constructing more complex probability. Section 2.4. k=1. K. K. K. Figure 8.9 (a) This fully-connected graph describes a general distribu-. tion over two K-state discrete variables having a total of. K 2 − 1 parameters..

Bayesian Networks. 367. x2. x2. distributions, and the framework of graphical models is very useful in expressing the. way in which these building blocks are linked together.. Such models have particularly nice properties if we choose the relationship be-. tween each parent-child pair in a directed graph to be conjugate, and we shall ex-. plore several examples of this shortly. Two cases are particularly worthy of note,. namely when the parent and child node each correspond to discrete variables and. when they each correspond to Gaussian variables, because in these two cases the. relationship can be extended hierarchically to construct arbitrarily complex directed. acyclic graphs. We begin by examining the discrete case.. The probability distribution p(x|µ) for a single discrete variable x having K. possible states (using the 1-of-K representation) is given by. p(x|µ) =. µxk. k. (8.9). distribution.. and is governed by the parameters µ = (µ1, . . . , µK)T. Due to the constraint. k µk = 1, only K − 1 values for µk need to be specified in order to define the. Now suppose that we have two discrete variables, x1 and x2, each of which has. K states, and we wish to model their joint distribution. We denote the probability of. observing both x1k = 1 and x2l = 1 by the parameter µkl, where x1k denotes the. kth component of x1, and similarly for x2l. The joint distribution can be written. p(x1, x2|µ) =. k=1. l=1. µx1kx2l. kl. k. l µkl = 1, this distri-. Because the parameters µkl are subject to the constraint. bution is governed by K 2 − 1 parameters. It is easily seen that the total number of. parameters that must be specified for an arbitrary joint distribution over M variables. is KM − 1 and therefore grows exponentially with the number M of variables.. Using the product rule, we can factor the joint distribution p(x1, x2) in the form. p(x2|x1)p(x1), which corresponds to a two-node graph with a link going from the. x1 node to the x2 node as shown in Figure 8.9(a). The marginal distribution p(x1). is governed by K − 1 parameters, as before, Similarly, the conditional distribution. p(x2|x1) requires the specification of K − 1 parameters for each of the K possible. values of x1. The total number of parameters that must be specified in the joint. distribution is therefore (K − 1) + K(K − 1) = K 2 − 1 as before.. Now suppose that the variables x1 and x2 were independent, corresponding to. the graphical model shown in Figure 8.9(b). Each variable is then described by. 368. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.10 This chain of M discrete nodes, each. having K states, requires the specification of K − 1 +. (M − 1)K(K − 1) parameters, which grows linearly. with the length M of the chain. In contrast, a fully con-. nected graph of M nodes would have KM − 1 param-. eters, which grows exponentially with M.. x1. x2. xM. a separate multinomial distribution, and the total number of parameters would be. 2(K − 1). For a distribution over M independent discrete variables, each having K. states, the total number of parameters would be M(K − 1), which therefore grows. linearly with the number of variables. From a graphical perspective, we have reduced. the number of parameters by dropping links in the graph, at the expense of having a. restricted class of distributions.. More generally, if we have M discrete variables x1, . . . , xM , we can model. the joint distribution using a directed graph with one variable corresponding to each. node. The conditional distribution at each node is given by a set of nonnegative pa-. rameters subject to the usual normalization constraint. If the graph is fully connected. then we have a completely general distribution having KM − 1 parameters, whereas. if there are no links in the graph the joint distribution factorizes into the product of. the marginals, and the total number of parameters is M(K − 1). Graphs having in-. termediate levels of connectivity allow for more general distributions than the fully. factorized one while requiring fewer parameters than the general joint distribution.. As an illustration, consider the chain of nodes shown in Figure 8.10. The marginal. distribution p(x1) requires K − 1 parameters, whereas each of the M − 1 condi-. tional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, requires K(K − 1) parameters.. This gives a total parameter count of K − 1 + (M − 1)K(K − 1), which is quadratic. in K and which grows linearly (rather than exponentially) with the length M of the. chain.. An alternative way to reduce the number of independent parameters in a model. is by sharing parameters (also known as tying of parameters). For instance, in the. chain example of Figure 8.10, we can arrange that all of the conditional distributions. p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, are governed by the same set of K(K−1) parameters.. Together with the K−1 parameters governing the distribution of x1, this gives a total. of K 2 − 1 parameters that must be specified in order to define the joint distribution.. We can turn a graph over discrete variables into a Bayesian model by introduc-. ing Dirichlet priors for the parameters. From a graphical point of view, each node. then acquires an additional parent representing the Dirichlet distribution over the pa-. rameters associated with the corresponding discrete node. This is illustrated for the. chain model in Figure 8.11. The corresponding model in which we tie the parame-. ters governing the conditional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, is shown. in Figure 8.12.. Another way of controlling the exponential growth in the number of parameters. in models of discrete variables is to use parameterized models for the conditional. distributions instead of complete tables of conditional probability values. To illus-. trate this idea, consider the graph in Figure 8.13 in which all of the nodes represent. binary variables. Each of the parent variables xi is governed by a single parame-.

The conditional distribution p(y|x1, . . . , xM ), however, would require. 2M parameters representing the probability p(y = 1) for each of the 2M possible. settings of the parent variables. Thus in general the number of parameters required. to specify this conditional distribution will grow exponentially with M. We can ob-. tain a more parsimonious form for the conditional distribution by using a logistic. sigmoid function acting on a linear combination of the parent variables, giving. Section 2.4. p(y = 1|x1, . . . , xM ) = σ. w0 +. wixi. = σ(wTx). (8.10). i=1. where σ(a) = (1+exp(−a))−1 is the logistic sigmoid, x = (x0, x1, . . . , xM )T is an. (M + 1)-dimensional vector of parent states augmented with an additional variable. x0 whose value is clamped to 1, and w = (w0, w1, . . . , wM )T is a vector of M + 1. parameters. This is a more restricted form of conditional distribution than the general. case but is now governed by a number of parameters that grows linearly with M. In. this sense, it is analogous to the choice of a restrictive form of covariance matrix (for. example, a diagonal matrix) in a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The motivation. for the logistic sigmoid representation was discussed in Section 4.2..

147,8.1.4,Linear-Gaussian models,"In the previous section, we saw how to construct joint probability distributions. over a set of discrete variables by expressing the variables as nodes in a directed. acyclic graph. Here we show how a multivariate Gaussian can be expressed as a. directed graph corresponding to a linear-Gaussian model over the component vari-. ables. This allows us to impose interesting structure on the distribution, with the. general Gaussian and the diagonal covariance Gaussian representing opposite ex-. tremes. Several widely used techniques are examples of linear-Gaussian models,. such as probabilistic principal component analysis, factor analysis, and linear dy-. namical systems (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999). We shall make extensive use of. the results of this section in later chapters when we consider some of these techniques. in detail.. Consider an arbitrary directed acyclic graph over D variables in which node i. represents a single continuous random variable xi having a Gaussian distribution.. The mean of this distribution is taken to be a linear combination of the states of its. parent nodes pai of node i. p(xi|pai) = N. wijxj + bi, vi. (8.11). where wij and bi are parameters governing the mean, and vi is the variance of the. conditional distribution for xi. The log of the joint distribution is then the log of the. product of these conditionals over all nodes in the graph and hence takes the form. ln p(x) =. ln p(xi|pai). (8.12). i=1. 1. 2vi. xi −. wijxj − bi. j∈pai. + const. (8.13). where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T and ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x. We see that. this is a quadratic function of the components of x, and hence the joint distribution. p(x) is a multivariate Gaussian.. We can determine the mean and covariance of the joint distribution recursively. as follows. Each variable xi has (conditional on the states of its parents) a Gaussian. distribution of the form (8.11) and so. xi =. wijxj + bi + √vi	i. (8.14). where 	i is a zero mean, unit variance Gaussian random variable satisfying E[	i] = 0. and E[	i	j] = Iij, where Iij is the i, j element of the identity matrix. Taking the. expectation of (8.14), we have. E[xi] =. wijE[xj] + bi.. (8.15). j∈pai. Figure 8.14 A directed graph over three Gaussian variables,. x1. x2. with one missing link.. 8.1. Bayesian Networks. 371. x3. Thus we can find the components of E[x] = (E[x1], . . . , E[xD])T by starting at the. lowest numbered node and working recursively through the graph (here we again. assume that the nodes are numbered such that each node has a higher number than. its parents). Similarly, we can use (8.14) and (8.15) to obtain the i, j element of the. covariance matrix for p(x) in the form of a recursion relation. cov[xi, xj] = E [(xi − E[xi])(xj − E[xj])]. = E. (xi − E[xi]). wjk(xk − E[xk]) + √vj	j. k∈paj. wjkcov[xi, xk] + Iijvj. k∈paj. (8.16). and so the covariance can similarly be evaluated recursively starting from the lowest. numbered node.. Let us consider two extreme cases. First of all, suppose that there are no links. in the graph, which therefore comprises D isolated nodes. In this case, there are no. parameters wij and so there are just D parameters bi and D parameters vi. From. the recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean of p(x) is given by. (b1, . . . , bD)T and the covariance matrix is diagonal of the form diag(v1, . . . , vD).. The joint distribution has a total of 2D parameters and represents a set of D inde-. pendent univariate Gaussian distributions.. Now consider a fully connected graph in which each node has all lower num-. bered nodes as parents. The matrix wij then has i − 1 entries on the ith row and. hence is a lower triangular matrix (with no entries on the leading diagonal). Then. the total number of parameters wij is obtained by taking the number D2 of elements. in a D× D matrix, subtracting D to account for the absence of elements on the lead-. ing diagonal, and then dividing by 2 because the matrix has elements only below the. diagonal, giving a total of D(D−1)/2. The total number of independent parameters. {wij} and {vi} in the covariance matrix is therefore D(D + 1)/2 corresponding to. a general symmetric covariance matrix.. Graphs having some intermediate level of complexity correspond to joint Gaus-. sian distributions with partially constrained covariance matrices. Consider for ex-. ample the graph shown in Figure 8.14, which has a link missing between variables. x1 and x3. Using the recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean and. covariance of the joint distribution are given by. µ = (b1, b2 + w21b1, b3 + w32b2 + w32w21b1)T. v1. w21v1. v2 + w2. w21v1. 21v1. w32w21v1 w32(v2 + w2. w32w21v1. w32(v2 + w2. 21v1). 32(v2 + w2. 21v1). 21v1) v3 + w2. (8.17). . (8.18). Section 2.3. Exercise 8.7. 372. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. We can readily extend the linear-Gaussian graphical model to the case in which. the nodes of the graph represent multivariate Gaussian variables. In this case, we can. write the conditional distribution for node i in the form. p(xi|pai) = N. xi. j∈pai. Wijxj + bi, Σi. (8.19). Section 2.3.6. where now Wij is a matrix (which is nonsquare if xi and xj have different dimen-. sionalities). Again it is easy to verify that the joint distribution over all variables is. Gaussian.. Note that we have already encountered a specific example of the linear-Gaussian. relationship when we saw that the conjugate prior for the mean µ of a Gaussian. variable x is itself a Gaussian distribution over µ. The joint distribution over x and. µ is therefore Gaussian. This corresponds to a simple two-node graph in which. the node representing µ is the parent of the node representing x. The mean of the. distribution over µ is a parameter controlling a prior, and so it can be viewed as a. hyperparameter. Because the value of this hyperparameter may itself be unknown,. we can again treat it from a Bayesian perspective by introducing a prior over the. hyperparameter, sometimes called a hyperprior, which is again given by a Gaussian. distribution. This type of construction can be extended in principle to any level and is. an illustration of a hierarchical Bayesian model, of which we shall encounter further. examples in later chapters.. "
148,8.2,Conditional Independence,"An important concept for probability distributions over multiple variables is that of. conditional independence (Dawid, 1980). Consider three variables a, b, and c, and. suppose that the conditional distribution of a, given b and c, is such that it does not. depend on the value of b, so that. p(a|b, c) = p(a|c).. (8.20). We say that a is conditionally independent of b given c. This can be expressed in a. slightly different way if we consider the joint distribution of a and b conditioned on. c, which we can write in the form. p(a, b|c) = p(a|b, c)p(b|c). = p(a|c)p(b|c).. (8.21). where we have used the product rule of probability together with (8.20). Thus we. see that, conditioned on c, the joint distribution of a and b factorizes into the prod-. uct of the marginal distribution of a and the marginal distribution of b (again both. conditioned on c). This says that the variables a and b are statistically independent,. given c. Note that our definition of conditional independence will require that (8.20),. Figure 8.15 The first of three examples of graphs over three variables. a, b, and c used to discuss conditional independence. properties of directed graphical models.. 8.2. Conditional Independence. 373. c. a. b. or equivalently (8.21), must hold for every possible value of c, and not just for some. values. We shall sometimes use a shorthand notation for conditional independence. (Dawid, 1979) in which. a ⊥⊥ b | c. (8.22). denotes that a is conditionally independent of b given c and is equivalent to (8.20).. Conditional independence properties play an important role in using probabilis-. tic models for pattern recognition by simplifying both the structure of a model and. the computations needed to perform inference and learning under that model. We. shall see examples of this shortly.. If we are given an expression for the joint distribution over a set of variables in. terms of a product of conditional distributions (i.e., the mathematical representation. underlying a directed graph), then we could in principle test whether any poten-. tial conditional independence property holds by repeated application of the sum and. product rules of probability. In practice, such an approach would be very time con-. suming. An important and elegant feature of graphical models is that conditional. independence properties of the joint distribution can be read directly from the graph. without having to perform any analytical manipulations. The general framework. for achieving this is called d-separation, where the ‘d’ stands for ‘directed’ (Pearl,. 1988). Here we shall motivate the concept of d-separation and give a general state-. ment of the d-separation criterion. A formal proof can be found in Lauritzen (1996).. "
149,8.2.1,Three example graphs,"We begin our discussion of the conditional independence properties of directed. graphs by considering three simple examples each involving graphs having just three. nodes. Together, these will motivate and illustrate the key concepts of d-separation.. The first of the three examples is shown in Figure 8.15, and the joint distribution. corresponding to this graph is easily written down using the general result (8.5) to. give. (8.23). If none of the variables are observed, then we can investigate whether a and b are. independent by marginalizing both sides of (8.23) with respect to c to give. p(a, b, c) = p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c).. p(a, b) =. p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c).. c. In general, this does not factorize into the product p(a)p(b), and so. a ⊥⊥ b | ∅. (8.24). (8.25). where ∅ denotes the empty set, and the symbol ⊥⊥ means that the conditional inde-. pendence property does not hold in general. Of course, it may hold for a particular. distribution by virtue of the specific numerical values associated with the various. conditional probabilities, but it does not follow in general from the structure of the. graph.. Now suppose we condition on the variable c, as represented by the graph of. Figure 8.16. From (8.23), we can easily write down the conditional distribution of a. and b, given c, in the form. p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c). = p(a|c)p(b|c). and so we obtain the conditional independence property. p(c). a ⊥⊥ b | c.. We can provide a simple graphical interpretation of this result by considering. the path from node a to node b via c. The node c is said to be tail-to-tail with re-. spect to this path because the node is connected to the tails of the two arrows, and. the presence of such a path connecting nodes a and b causes these nodes to be de-. pendent. However, when we condition on node c, as in Figure 8.16, the conditioned. node ‘blocks’ the path from a to b and causes a and b to become (conditionally). independent.. We can similarly consider the graph shown in Figure 8.17. The joint distribution. corresponding to this graph is again obtained from our general formula (8.5) to give. p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c).. (8.26). First of all, suppose that none of the variables are observed. Again, we can test to. see if a and b are independent by marginalizing over c to give. 374. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.16 As in Figure 8.15 but where we have conditioned on the. value of variable c.. c. a. b. p(a, b) = p(a). p(c|a)p(b|c) = p(a)p(b|a).. c.

Now suppose we condition on node c, as shown in Figure 8.18. Using Bayes’. theorem, together with (8.26), we obtain. p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c). p(c). = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c). p(c). = p(a|c)p(b|c). and so again we obtain the conditional independence property. a ⊥⊥ b | c.. As before, we can interpret these results graphically. The node c is said to be. head-to-tail with respect to the path from node a to node b. Such a path connects. nodes a and b and renders them dependent. If we now observe c, as in Figure 8.18,. then this observation ‘blocks’ the path from a to b and so we obtain the conditional. independence property a ⊥⊥ b | c.. Finally, we consider the third of our 3-node examples, shown by the graph in. Figure 8.19. As we shall see, this has a more subtle behaviour than the two previous. graphs.. The joint distribution can again be written down using our general result (8.5) to. give. p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b).. (8.28). Consider first the case where none of the variables are observed. Marginalizing both. sides of (8.28) over c we obtain. p(a, b) = p(a)p(b). Figure 8.19 The last of our three examples of 3-node graphs used to. explore conditional independence properties in graphi-. cal models. This graph has rather different properties. from the two previous examples.. a. b. c. 376. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.20 As in Figure 8.19 but conditioning on the value of node. c. In this graph, the act of conditioning induces a depen-. dence between a and b.. a. b. c. and so a and b are independent with no variables observed, in contrast to the two. previous examples. We can write this result as. Now suppose we condition on c, as indicated in Figure 8.20. The conditional distri-. bution of a and b is then given by. a ⊥⊥ b | ∅.. (8.29). p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c). p(c). = p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b). p(c). which in general does not factorize into the product p(a)p(b), and so. a ⊥⊥ b | c.. Thus our third example has the opposite behaviour from the first two. Graphically,. we say that node c is head-to-head with respect to the path from a to b because it. connects to the heads of the two arrows. When node c is unobserved, it ‘blocks’. the path, and the variables a and b are independent. However, conditioning on c. ‘unblocks’ the path and renders a and b dependent.. There is one more subtlety associated with this third example that we need to. consider. First we introduce some more terminology. We say that node y is a de-. scendant of node x if there is a path from x to y in which each step of the path. follows the directions of the arrows. Then it can be shown that a head-to-head path. will become unblocked if either the node, or any of its descendants, is observed.. In summary, a tail-to-tail node or a head-to-tail node leaves a path unblocked. unless it is observed in which case it blocks the path. By contrast, a head-to-head. node blocks a path if it is unobserved, but once the node, and/or at least one of its. descendants, is observed the path becomes unblocked.. It is worth spending a moment to understand further the unusual behaviour of the. graph of Figure 8.20. Consider a particular instance of such a graph corresponding. to a problem with three binary random variables relating to the fuel system on a car,. as shown in Figure 8.21. The variables are called B, representing the state of a. battery that is either charged (B = 1) or flat (B = 0), F representing the state of. the fuel tank that is either full of fuel (F = 1) or empty (F = 0), and G, which is. the state of an electric fuel gauge and which indicates either full (G = 1) or empty. Exercise 8.10. B. Given the state of the fuel tank and the battery, the fuel gauge reads full with proba-. bilities given by. p(B = 1) = 0.9. p(F = 1) = 0.9.. p(G = 1|B = 1, F = 1) = 0.8. p(G = 1|B = 1, F = 0) = 0.2. p(G = 1|B = 0, F = 1) = 0.2. p(G = 1|B = 0, F = 0) = 0.1.

The three. nodes represent the state of the battery (B), the state of the fuel tank (F ) and the reading on the electric fuel. gauge (G). See the text for details.. (G = 0). The battery is either charged or flat, and independently the fuel tank is. either full or empty, with prior probabilities. so this is a rather unreliable fuel gauge! All remaining probabilities are determined. by the requirement that probabilities sum to one, and so we have a complete specifi-. cation of the probabilistic model.. Before we observe any data, the prior probability of the fuel tank being empty. is p(F = 0) = 0.1. Now suppose that we observe the fuel gauge and discover that. it reads empty, i.e., G = 0, corresponding to the middle graph in Figure 8.21. We. can use Bayes’ theorem to evaluate the posterior probability of the fuel tank being. empty. First we evaluate the denominator for Bayes’ theorem given by. p(G = 0) =. B∈{0,1}. and similarly we evaluate. F∈{0,1}. p(G = 0|B, F )p(B)p(F ) = 0.315. (8.30). p(G = 0|F = 0) =. B∈{0,1}. and using these results we have. p(G = 0|B, F = 0)p(B) = 0.81. (8.31). p(F = 0|G = 0) = p(G = 0|F = 0)p(F = 0). p(G = 0).  0.257. (8.32). and so p(F = 0|G = 0) > p(F = 0). Thus observing that the gauge reads empty. makes it more likely that the tank is indeed empty, as we would intuitively expect.. Next suppose that we also check the state of the battery and find that it is flat, i.e.,. B = 0. We have now observed the states of both the fuel gauge and the battery, as. shown by the right-hand graph in Figure 8.21. The posterior probability that the fuel. tank is empty given the observations of both the fuel gauge and the battery state is. then given by. p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) = p(G = 0|B = 0, F = 0)p(F = 0). p(G = 0|B = 0, F )p(F )  0.111 (8.33). 378. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. F∈{0,1}. where the prior probability p(B = 0) has cancelled between numerator and denom-. inator. Thus the probability that the tank is empty has decreased (from 0.257 to. 0.111) as a result of the observation of the state of the battery. This accords with our. intuition that finding out that the battery is flat explains away the observation that the. fuel gauge reads empty. We see that the state of the fuel tank and that of the battery. have indeed become dependent on each other as a result of observing the reading. on the fuel gauge. In fact, this would also be the case if, instead of observing the. fuel gauge directly, we observed the state of some descendant of G. Note that the. probability p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0)  0.111 is greater than the prior probability. p(F = 0) = 0.1 because the observation that the fuel gauge reads zero still provides. some evidence in favour of an empty fuel tank.. "
150,8.2.2,D-separation,"We now give a general statement of the d-separation property (Pearl, 1988) for. directed graphs. Consider a general directed graph in which A, B, and C are arbi-. trary nonintersecting sets of nodes (whose union may be smaller than the complete. set of nodes in the graph). We wish to ascertain whether a particular conditional. independence statement A ⊥⊥ B | C is implied by a given directed acyclic graph. To. do so, we consider all possible paths from any node in A to any node in B. Any such. path is said to be blocked if it includes a node such that either. (a) the arrows on the path meet either head-to-tail or tail-to-tail at the node, and the. node is in the set C, or. (b) the arrows meet head-to-head at the node, and neither the node, nor any of its. descendants, is in the set C.. If all paths are blocked, then A is said to be d-separated from B by C, and the joint. distribution over all of the variables in the graph will satisfy A ⊥⊥ B | C.. The concept of d-separation is illustrated in Figure 8.22. In graph (a), the path. from a to b is not blocked by node f because it is a tail-to-tail node for this path. and is not observed, nor is it blocked by node e because, although the latter is a. head-to-head node, it has a descendant c because is in the conditioning set. Thus. the conditional independence statement a ⊥⊥ b | c does not follow from this graph.. In graph (b), the path from a to b is blocked by node f because this is a tail-to-tail. node that is observed, and so the conditional independence property a ⊥⊥ b | f will. 8.2. Conditional Independence. 379. Figure 8.22 Illustration of the con-. cept of d-separation. See the text for. details.. a. f. (a). e. c. a. f. b. e. c. (b). b. N. Section 2.3. be satisfied by any distribution that factorizes according to this graph. Note that this. path is also blocked by node e because e is a head-to-head node and neither it nor its. descendant are in the conditioning set.. For the purposes of d-separation, parameters such as α and σ2 in Figure 8.5,. indicated by small filled circles, behave in the same was as observed nodes. How-. ever, there are no marginal distributions associated with such nodes. Consequently. parameter nodes never themselves have parents and so all paths through these nodes. will always be tail-to-tail and hence blocked. Consequently they play no role in. d-separation.. Another example of conditional independence and d-separation is provided by. the concept of i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) data introduced in Sec-. tion 1.2.4. Consider the problem of finding the posterior distribution for the mean. of a univariate Gaussian distribution. This can be represented by the directed graph. shown in Figure 8.23 in which the joint distribution is defined by a prior p(µ) to-. gether with a set of conditional distributions p(xn|µ) for n = 1, . . . , N. In practice,. we observe D = {x1, . . . , xN} and our goal is to infer µ. Suppose, for a moment,. that we condition on µ and consider the joint distribution of the observations. Using. d-separation, we note that there is a unique path from any xi to any other xj=i and. that this path is tail-to-tail with respect to the observed node µ. Every such path is. blocked and so the observations D = {x1, . . . , xN} are independent given µ, so that.

We see that the node for w is tail-to-tail with respect to. spond to {tn}, w and. the path from. t to any one of the nodes tn and so we have the following conditional. independence property. t ⊥⊥ tn | w.. (8.36). Thus, conditioned on the polynomial coefficients w, the predictive distribution for. t is independent of the training data {t1, . . . , tN}. We can therefore first use the. training data to determine the posterior distribution over the coefficients w and then. we can discard the training data and use the posterior distribution for w to make. predictions of. t for new input observations. x.. A related graphical structure arises in an approach to classification called the. naive Bayes model, in which we use conditional independence assumptions to sim-. plify the model structure. Suppose our observed variable consists of a D-dimensional. vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T, and we wish to assign observed values of x to one of K. classes. Using the 1-of-K encoding scheme, we can represent these classes by a K-. dimensional binary vector z. We can then define a generative model by introducing. a multinomial prior p(z|µ) over the class labels, where the kth component µk of µ. is the prior probability of class Ck, together with a conditional distribution p(x|z). for the observed vector x. The key assumption of the naive Bayes model is that,. conditioned on the class z, the distributions of the input variables x1, . . . , xD are in-. dependent. The graphical representation of this model is shown in Figure 8.24. We. see that observation of z blocks the path between xi and xj for j = i (because such. paths are tail-to-tail at the node z) and so xi and xj are conditionally independent. given z. If, however, we marginalize out z (so that z is unobserved) the tail-to-tail. path from xi to xj is no longer blocked. This tells us that in general the marginal. density p(x) will not factorize with respect to the components of x. We encountered. a simple application of the naive Bayes model in the context of fusing data from. different sources for medical diagnosis in Section 1.5.. If we are given a labelled training set, comprising inputs {x1, . . . , xN} together. with their class labels, then we can fit the naive Bayes model to the training data. 8.2. Conditional Independence. 381. using maximum likelihood assuming that the data are drawn independently from. the model. The solution is obtained by fitting the model for each class separately. using the correspondingly labelled data. As an example, suppose that the probability. density within each class is chosen to be Gaussian. In this case, the naive Bayes. assumption then implies that the covariance matrix for each Gaussian is diagonal,. and the contours of constant density within each class will be axis-aligned ellipsoids.. The marginal density, however, is given by a superposition of diagonal Gaussians. (with weighting coefficients given by the class priors) and so will no longer factorize. with respect to its components.. The naive Bayes assumption is helpful when the dimensionality D of the input. space is high, making density estimation in the full D-dimensional space more chal-. lenging. It is also useful if the input vector contains both discrete and continuous. variables, since each can be represented separately using appropriate models (e.g.,. Bernoulli distributions for binary observations or Gaussians for real-valued vari-. ables). The conditional independence assumption of this model is clearly a strong. one that may lead to rather poor representations of the class-conditional densities.. Nevertheless, even if this assumption is not precisely satisfied, the model may still. give good classification performance in practice because the decision boundaries can. be insensitive to some of the details in the class-conditional densities, as illustrated. in Figure 1.27.. We have seen that a particular directed graph represents a specific decomposition. of a joint probability distribution into a product of conditional probabilities. The. graph also expresses a set of conditional independence statements obtained through. the d-separation criterion, and the d-separation theorem is really an expression of the. equivalence of these two properties. In order to make this clear, it is helpful to think. of a directed graph as a filter. Suppose we consider a particular joint probability. distribution p(x) over the variables x corresponding to the (nonobserved) nodes of. the graph. The filter will allow this distribution to pass through if, and only if, it can. be expressed in terms of the factorization (8.5) implied by the graph. If we present to. the filter the set of all possible distributions p(x) over the set of variables x, then the. subset of distributions that are passed by the filter will be denoted DF, for directed. factorization. This is illustrated in Figure 8.25. Alternatively, we can use the graph as. a different kind of filter by first listing all of the conditional independence properties. obtained by applying the d-separation criterion to the graph, and then allowing a. distribution to pass only if it satisfies all of these properties. If we present all possible. distributions p(x) to this second kind of filter, then the d-separation theorem tells us. that the set of distributions that will be allowed through is precisely the set DF.. It should be emphasized that the conditional independence properties obtained. from d-separation apply to any probabilistic model described by that particular di-. rected graph. This will be true, for instance, whether the variables are discrete or. continuous or a combination of these. Again, we see that a particular graph is de-. scribing a whole family of probability distributions.. At one extreme we have a fully connected graph that exhibits no conditional in-. dependence properties at all, and which can represent any possible joint probability. distribution over the given variables. The set DF will contain all possible distribu-. k. p(xi|x{j=i}) =. p(x1, . . . , xD). p(x1, . . . , xD) dxi. p(xk|pak). p(xk|pak) dxi. k. in which the integral is replaced by a summation in the case of discrete variables. We. now observe that any factor p(xk|pak) that does not have any functional dependence. on xi can be taken outside the integral over xi, and will therefore cancel between. numerator and denominator. The only factors that remain will be the conditional. distribution p(xi|pai) for node xi itself, together with the conditional distributions. for any nodes xk such that node xi is in the conditioning set of p(xk|pak), in other. words for which xi is a parent of xk. The conditional p(xi|pai) will depend on the. parents of node xi, whereas the conditionals p(xk|pak) will depend on the children. 382. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. p(x). DF. Figure 8.25 We can view a graphical model (in this case a directed graph) as a filter in which a prob-. ability distribution p(x) is allowed through the filter if, and only if, it satisfies the directed. factorization property (8.5). The set of all possible probability distributions p(x) that pass. through the filter is denoted DF. We can alternatively use the graph to filter distributions. according to whether they respect all of the conditional independencies implied by the. d-separation properties of the graph. The d-separation theorem says that it is the same. set of distributions DF that will be allowed through this second kind of filter.. tions p(x). At the other extreme, we have the fully disconnected graph, i.e., one. having no links at all. This corresponds to joint distributions which factorize into the. product of the marginal distributions over the variables comprising the nodes of the. graph.. Note that for any given graph, the set of distributions DF will include any dis-. tributions that have additional independence properties beyond those described by. the graph. For instance, a fully factorized distribution will always be passed through. the filter implied by any graph over the corresponding set of variables.. We end our discussion of conditional independence properties by exploring the. concept of a Markov blanket or Markov boundary. Consider a joint distribution. p(x1, . . . , xD) represented by a directed graph having D nodes, and consider the. conditional distribution of a particular node with variables xi conditioned on all of. the remaining variables xj=i. Using the factorization property (8.5), we can express. this conditional distribution in the form. "
151,8.3,Markov Random Fields,"383. Figure 8.26 The Markov blanket of a node xi comprises the set. of parents, children and co-parents of the node.. It. has the property that the conditional distribution of. xi, conditioned on all the remaining variables in the. graph, is dependent only on the variables in the. Markov blanket.. xi. of xi as well as on the co-parents, in other words variables corresponding to parents. of node xk other than node xi. The set of nodes comprising the parents, the children. and the co-parents is called the Markov blanket and is illustrated in Figure 8.26. We. can think of the Markov blanket of a node xi as being the minimal set of nodes that. isolates xi from the rest of the graph. Note that it is not sufficient to include only the. parents and children of node xi because the phenomenon of explaining away means. that observations of the child nodes will not block paths to the co-parents. We must. therefore observe the co-parent nodes also.. 8.3. Markov Random Fields. We have seen that directed graphical models specify a factorization of the joint dis-. tribution over a set of variables into a product of local conditional distributions. They. also define a set of conditional independence properties that must be satisfied by any. distribution that factorizes according to the graph. We turn now to the second ma-. jor class of graphical models that are described by undirected graphs and that again. specify both a factorization and a set of conditional independence relations.. A Markov random field, also known as a Markov network or an undirected. graphical model (Kindermann and Snell, 1980), has a set of nodes each of which. corresponds to a variable or group of variables, as well as a set of links each of. which connects a pair of nodes. The links are undirected, that is they do not carry. arrows. In the case of undirected graphs, it is convenient to begin with a discussion. of conditional independence properties.. "
152,8.3.1,Conditional independence properties,"In the case of directed graphs, we saw that it was possible to test whether a par-. ticular conditional independence property holds by applying a graphical test called. d-separation. This involved testing whether or not the paths connecting two sets of. nodes were ‘blocked’. The definition of blocked, however, was somewhat subtle. due to the presence of paths having head-to-head nodes. We might ask whether it. is possible to define an alternative graphical semantics for probability distributions. such that conditional independence is determined by simple graph separation. This. is indeed the case and corresponds to undirected graphical models. By removing the. Section 8.2. 384. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.27 An example of an undirected graph in. which every path from any node in set. A to any node in set B passes through. at least one node in set C. Conse-. quently the conditional. independence. property A ⊥⊥ B | C holds for any. probability distribution described by this. graph.. C. B. A. directionality from the links of the graph, the asymmetry between parent and child. nodes is removed, and so the subtleties associated with head-to-head nodes no longer. arise.. Suppose that in an undirected graph we identify three sets of nodes, denoted A,. B, and C, and that we consider the conditional independence property. A ⊥⊥ B | C.. (8.37). To test whether this property is satisfied by a probability distribution defined by a. graph we consider all possible paths that connect nodes in set A to nodes in set. B. If all such paths pass through one or more nodes in set C, then all such paths are. ‘blocked’ and so the conditional independence property holds. However, if there is at. least one such path that is not blocked, then the property does not necessarily hold, or. more precisely there will exist at least some distributions corresponding to the graph. that do not satisfy this conditional independence relation. This is illustrated with an. example in Figure 8.27. Note that this is exactly the same as the d-separation crite-. rion except that there is no ‘explaining away’ phenomenon. Testing for conditional. independence in undirected graphs is therefore simpler than in directed graphs.. An alternative way to view the conditional independence test is to imagine re-. moving all nodes in set C from the graph together with any links that connect to. those nodes. We then ask if there exists a path that connects any node in A to any. node in B. If there are no such paths, then the conditional independence property. must hold.. The Markov blanket for an undirected graph takes a particularly simple form,. because a node will be conditionally independent of all other nodes conditioned only. on the neighbouring nodes, as illustrated in Figure 8.28.. "
153,8.3.2,Factorization properties,"We now seek a factorization rule for undirected graphs that will correspond to. the above conditional independence test. Again, this will involve expressing the joint. distribution p(x) as a product of functions defined over sets of variables that are local. to the graph. We therefore need to decide what is the appropriate notion of locality. in this case.. 8.3. Markov Random Fields. 385. Figure 8.28 For an undirected graph, the Markov blanket of a node. xi consists of the set of neighbouring nodes.. It has the. property that the conditional distribution of xi, conditioned. on all the remaining variables in the graph, is dependent. only on the variables in the Markov blanket.. If we consider two nodes xi and xj that are not connected by a link, then these. variables must be conditionally independent given all other nodes in the graph. This. follows from the fact that there is no direct path between the two nodes, and all other. paths pass through nodes that are observed, and hence those paths are blocked. This. conditional independence property can be expressed as. p(xi, xj|x\{i,j}) = p(xi|x\{i,j})p(xj|x\{i,j}). (8.38). where x\{i,j} denotes the set x of all variables with xi and xj removed. The factor-. ization of the joint distribution must therefore be such that xi and xj do not appear. in the same factor in order for the conditional independence property to hold for all. possible distributions belonging to the graph.. This leads us to consider a graphical concept called a clique, which is defined. as a subset of the nodes in a graph such that there exists a link between all pairs of. nodes in the subset. In other words, the set of nodes in a clique is fully connected.. Furthermore, a maximal clique is a clique such that it is not possible to include any. other nodes from the graph in the set without it ceasing to be a clique. These concepts. are illustrated by the undirected graph over four variables shown in Figure 8.29. This. graph has five cliques of two nodes given by {x1, x2}, {x2, x3}, {x3, x4}, {x4, x2},. and {x1, x3}, as well as two maximal cliques given by {x1, x2, x3} and {x2, x3, x4}.. The set {x1, x2, x3, x4} is not a clique because of the missing link from x1 to x4.. We can therefore define the factors in the decomposition of the joint distribution. to be functions of the variables in the cliques. In fact, we can consider functions. of the maximal cliques, without loss of generality, because other cliques must be. subsets of maximal cliques. Thus, if {x1, x2, x3} is a maximal clique and we define. an arbitrary function over this clique, then including another factor defined over a. subset of these variables would be redundant.. Let us denote a clique by C and the set of variables in that clique by xC. Then. Figure 8.29 A four-node undirected graph showing a clique (outlined in. green) and a maximal clique (outlined in blue).. x1. x3. x2. x4. C. 1. Z. the joint distribution is written as a product of potential functions ψC(xC) over the. maximal cliques of the graph. p(x) =. ψC(xC).. (8.39). 386. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Here the quantity Z, sometimes called the partition function, is a normalization con-. stant and is given by. Z =. ψC(xC). x. C. (8.40). which ensures that the distribution p(x) given by (8.39) is correctly normalized.. By considering only potential functions which satisfy ψC(xC) � 0 we ensure that. p(x) � 0. In (8.40) we have assumed that x comprises discrete variables, but the. framework is equally applicable to continuous variables, or a combination of the two,. in which the summation is replaced by the appropriate combination of summation. and integration.. Note that we do not restrict the choice of potential functions to those that have a. specific probabilistic interpretation as marginal or conditional distributions. This is. in contrast to directed graphs in which each factor represents the conditional distribu-. tion of the corresponding variable, conditioned on the state of its parents. However,. in special cases, for instance where the undirected graph is constructed by starting. with a directed graph, the potential functions may indeed have such an interpretation,. as we shall see shortly.. One consequence of the generality of the potential functions ψC(xC) is that. their product will in general not be correctly normalized. We therefore have to in-. troduce an explicit normalization factor given by (8.40). Recall that for directed. graphs, the joint distribution was automatically normalized as a consequence of the. normalization of each of the conditional distributions in the factorization.. The presence of this normalization constant is one of the major limitations of. undirected graphs. If we have a model with M discrete nodes each having K states,. then the evaluation of the normalization term involves summing over KM states and. so (in the worst case) is exponential in the size of the model. The partition function. is needed for parameter learning because it will be a function of any parameters that. govern the potential functions ψC(xC). However, for evaluation of local conditional. distributions, the partition function is not needed because a conditional is the ratio. of two marginals, and the partition function cancels between numerator and denom-. inator when evaluating this ratio. Similarly, for evaluating local marginal probabil-. ities we can work with the unnormalized joint distribution and then normalize the. marginals explicitly at the end. Provided the marginals only involves a small number. of variables, the evaluation of their normalization coefficient will be feasible.. So far, we have discussed the notion of conditional independence based on sim-. ple graph separation and we have proposed a factorization of the joint distribution. that is intended to correspond to this conditional independence structure. However,. we have not made any formal connection between conditional independence and. factorization for undirected graphs. To do so we need to restrict attention to poten-. tial functions ψC(xC) that are strictly positive (i.e., never zero or negative for any. 8.3. Markov Random Fields. 387. choice of xC). Given this restriction, we can make a precise relationship between. factorization and conditional independence.. To do this we again return to the concept of a graphical model as a filter, corre-. sponding to Figure 8.25. Consider the set of all possible distributions defined over. a fixed set of variables corresponding to the nodes of a particular undirected graph.. We can define UI to be the set of such distributions that are consistent with the set. of conditional independence statements that can be read from the graph using graph. separation. Similarly, we can define UF to be the set of such distributions that can. be expressed as a factorization of the form (8.39) with respect to the maximal cliques. of the graph. The Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Clifford, 1990) states that the sets. UI and UF are identical.. convenient to express them as exponentials, so that. Because we are restricted to potential functions which are strictly positive it is. ψC(xC) = exp{−E(xC)}. (8.41). where E(xC) is called an energy function, and the exponential representation is. called the Boltzmann distribution. The joint distribution is defined as the product of. potentials, and so the total energy is obtained by adding the energies of each of the. maximal cliques.. In contrast to the factors in the joint distribution for a directed graph, the po-. tentials in an undirected graph do not have a specific probabilistic interpretation.. Although this gives greater flexibility in choosing the potential functions, because. there is no normalization constraint, it does raise the question of how to motivate a. choice of potential function for a particular application. This can be done by view-. ing the potential function as expressing which configurations of the local variables. are preferred to others. Global configurations that have a relatively high probability. are those that find a good balance in satisfying the (possibly conflicting) influences. of the clique potentials. We turn now to a specific example to illustrate the use of. undirected graphs.. "
154,8.3.3,Illustration: Image de-noising,"We can illustrate the application of undirected graphs using an example of noise. removal from a binary image (Besag, 1974; Geman and Geman, 1984; Besag, 1986).. Although a very simple example, this is typical of more sophisticated applications.. Let the observed noisy image be described by an array of binary pixel values yi ∈. {−1, +1}, where the index i = 1, . . . , D runs over all pixels. We shall suppose. that the image is obtained by taking an unknown noise-free image, described by. binary pixel values xi ∈ {−1, +1} and randomly flipping the sign of pixels with. some small probability. An example binary image, together with a noise corrupted. image obtained by flipping the sign of the pixels with probability 10%, is shown in. Figure 8.30. Given the noisy image, our goal is to recover the original noise-free. image.. Because the noise level is small, we know that there will be a strong correlation. between xi and yi. We also know that neighbouring pixels xi and xj in an image. are strongly correlated. This prior knowledge can be captured using the Markov. 388. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.30 Illustration of image de-noising using a Markov random field. The top row shows the original. binary image on the left and the corrupted image after randomly changing 10% of the pixels on the right. The. bottom row shows the restored images obtained using iterated conditional models (ICM) on the left and using. the graph-cut algorithm on the right.. ICM produces an image where 96% of the pixels agree with the original. image, whereas the corresponding number for graph-cut is 99%.. random field model whose undirected graph is shown in Figure 8.31. This graph has. two types of cliques, each of which contains two variables. The cliques of the form. {xi, yi} have an associated energy function that expresses the correlation between. these variables. We choose a very simple energy function for these cliques of the. form −ηxiyi where η is a positive constant. This has the desired effect of giving a. lower energy (thus encouraging a higher probability) when xi and yi have the same. sign and a higher energy when they have the opposite sign.. The remaining cliques comprise pairs of variables {xi, xj} where i and j are. indices of neighbouring pixels. Again, we want the energy to be lower when the. pixels have the same sign than when they have the opposite sign, and so we choose. an energy given by −βxixj where β is a positive constant.. Because a potential function is an arbitrary, nonnegative function over a maximal. clique, we can multiply it by any nonnegative functions of subsets of the clique, or. xi. 8.3. Markov Random Fields. 389. Figure 8.31 An undirected graphical model representing a. Markov random field for image de-noising,. in. which xi is a binary variable denoting the state. of pixel i in the unknown noise-free image, and yi. denotes the corresponding value of pixel i in the. observed noisy image.. yi. equivalently we can add the corresponding energies. In this example, this allows us. to add an extra term hxi for each pixel i in the noise-free image. Such a term has. the effect of biasing the model towards pixel values that have one particular sign in. preference to the other.. The complete energy function for the model then takes the form. E(x, y) = h. xi − β. i. {i,j}. xixj − η. i. xiyi. which defines a joint distribution over x and y given by. p(x, y) =. 1. Z. exp{−E(x, y)}.. (8.42). (8.43). We now fix the elements of y to the observed values given by the pixels of the. noisy image, which implicitly defines a conditional distribution p(x|y) over noise-. free images. This is an example of the Ising model, which has been widely studied in. statistical physics. For the purposes of image restoration, we wish to find an image x. having a high probability (ideally the maximum probability). To do this we shall use. a simple iterative technique called iterated conditional modes, or ICM (Kittler and. F¨oglein, 1984), which is simply an application of coordinate-wise gradient ascent.. The idea is first to initialize the variables {xi}, which we do by simply setting xi =. yi for all i. Then we take one node xj at a time and we evaluate the total energy. for the two possible states xj = +1 and xj = −1, keeping all other node variables. fixed, and set xj to whichever state has the lower energy. This will either leave. the probability unchanged, if xj is unchanged, or will increase it. Because only. one variable is changed, this is a simple local computation that can be performed. efficiently. We then repeat the update for another site, and so on, until some suitable. stopping criterion is satisfied. The nodes may be updated in a systematic way, for. instance by repeatedly raster scanning through the image, or by choosing nodes at. random.. If we have a sequence of updates in which every site is visited at least once,. and in which no changes to the variables are made, then by definition the algorithm. Exercise 8.13. 390. 8.

For the purposes of this simple illustration, we have fixed the parameters to be. β = 1.0, η = 2.1 and h = 0. Note that leaving h = 0 simply means that the prior. probabilities of the two states of xi are equal. Starting with the observed noisy image. as the initial configuration, we run ICM until convergence, leading to the de-noised. image shown in the lower left panel of Figure 8.30. Note that if we set β = 0,. which effectively removes the links between neighbouring pixels, then the global. most probable solution is given by xi = yi for all i, corresponding to the observed. noisy image.. Later we shall discuss a more effective algorithm for finding high probability so-. lutions called the max-product algorithm, which typically leads to better solutions,. although this is still not guaranteed to find the global maximum of the posterior dis-. tribution. However, for certain classes of model, including the one given by (8.42),. there exist efficient algorithms based on graph cuts that are guaranteed to find the. global maximum (Greig et al., 1989; Boykov et al., 2001; Kolmogorov and Zabih,. 2004). The lower right panel of Figure 8.30 shows the result of applying a graph-cut. algorithm to the de-noising problem.. Exercise 8.14. Section 8.4. "
155,8.3.4,Relation to directed graphs,"We have introduced two graphical frameworks for representing probability dis-. tributions, corresponding to directed and undirected graphs, and it is instructive to. discuss the relation between these. Consider first the problem of taking a model that. is specified using a directed graph and trying to convert it to an undirected graph. In. some cases this is straightforward, as in the simple example in Figure 8.32. Here the. joint distribution for the directed graph is given as a product of conditionals in the. form. p(x) = p(x1)p(x2|x1)p(x3|x2)··· p(xN|xN−1).. (8.44). Now let us convert this to an undirected graph representation, as shown in Fig-. ure 8.32. In the undirected graph, the maximal cliques are simply the pairs of neigh-. bouring nodes, and so from (8.39) we wish to write the joint distribution in the form. p(x) =. 1. Z. ψ1,2(x1, x2)ψ2,3(x2, x3)··· ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ).. (8.45). Figure 8.33 Example of a simple. directed graph (a) and the corre-. sponding moral graph (b).. x1. x3. x1. x3. x2. x2. 8.3. Markov Random Fields. 391. x4. (a). x4. (b). This is easily done by identifying. ψ1,2(x1, x2) = p(x1)p(x2|x1). ψ2,3(x2, x3) = p(x3|x2). ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ) = p(xN|xN−1). where we have absorbed the marginal p(x1) for the first node into the first potential. function. Note that in this case, the partition function Z = 1.. Let us consider how to generalize this construction, so that we can convert any. distribution specified by a factorization over a directed graph into one specified by a. factorization over an undirected graph. This can be achieved if the clique potentials. of the undirected graph are given by the conditional distributions of the directed. graph. In order for this to be valid, we must ensure that the set of variables that. appears in each of the conditional distributions is a member of at least one clique of. the undirected graph. For nodes on the directed graph having just one parent, this is. achieved simply by replacing the directed link with an undirected link. However, for. nodes in the directed graph having more than one parent, this is not sufficient. These. are nodes that have ‘head-to-head’ paths encountered in our discussion of conditional. independence. Consider a simple directed graph over 4 nodes shown in Figure 8.33.. The joint distribution for the directed graph takes the form. p(x) = p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x4|x1, x2, x3).. (8.46). We see that the factor p(x4|x1, x2, x3) involves the four variables x1, x2, x3, and. x4, and so these must all belong to a single clique if this conditional distribution is. to be absorbed into a clique potential. To ensure this, we add extra links between. all pairs of parents of the node x4. Anachronistically, this process of ‘marrying. the parents’ has become known as moralization, and the resulting undirected graph,. after dropping the arrows, is called the moral graph. It is important to observe that. the moral graph in this example is fully connected and so exhibits no conditional. independence properties, in contrast to the original directed graph.. Thus in general to convert a directed graph into an undirected graph, we first add. additional undirected links between all pairs of parents for each node in the graph and. 392. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Section 8.4. Section 8.2. then drop the arrows on the original links to give the moral graph. Then we initialize. all of the clique potentials of the moral graph to 1. We then take each conditional. distribution factor in the original directed graph and multiply it into one of the clique. potentials. There will always exist at least one maximal clique that contains all of. the variables in the factor as a result of the moralization step. Note that in all cases. the partition function is given by Z = 1.. The process of converting a directed graph into an undirected graph plays an. important role in exact inference techniques such as the junction tree algorithm.. Converting from an undirected to a directed representation is much less common. and in general presents problems due to the normalization constraints.. We saw that in going from a directed to an undirected representation we had to. discard some conditional independence properties from the graph. Of course, we. could always trivially convert any distribution over a directed graph into one over an. undirected graph by simply using a fully connected undirected graph. This would,. however, discard all conditional independence properties and so would be vacuous.. The process of moralization adds the fewest extra links and so retains the maximum. number of independence properties.. We have seen that the procedure for determining the conditional independence. properties is different between directed and undirected graphs. It turns out that the. two types of graph can express different conditional independence properties, and. it is worth exploring this issue in more detail. To do so, we return to the view of. a specific (directed or undirected) graph as a filter, so that the set of all possible. distributions over the given variables could be reduced to a subset that respects the. conditional independencies implied by the graph. A graph is said to be a D map. (for ‘dependency map’) of a distribution if every conditional independence statement. satisfied by the distribution is reflected in the graph. Thus a completely disconnected. graph (no links) will be a trivial D map for any distribution.. Alternatively, we can consider a specific distribution and ask which graphs have. the appropriate conditional independence properties. If every conditional indepen-. dence statement implied by a graph is satisfied by a specific distribution, then the. graph is said to be an I map (for ‘independence map’) of that distribution. Clearly a. fully connected graph will be a trivial I map for any distribution.. If it is the case that every conditional independence property of the distribution. is reflected in the graph, and vice versa, then the graph is said to be a perfect map for. Figure 8.34 Venn diagram illustrating the set of all distributions.

B. C. that distribution. A perfect map is therefore both an I map and a D map.. Consider the set of distributions such that for each distribution there exists a. directed graph that is a perfect map. This set is distinct from the set of distributions. such that for each distribution there exists an undirected graph that is a perfect map.. In addition there are distributions for which neither directed nor undirected graphs. offer a perfect map. This is illustrated as a Venn diagram in Figure 8.34.. Figure 8.35 shows an example of a directed graph that is a perfect map for. a distribution satisfying the conditional independence properties A ⊥⊥ B | ∅ and. A ⊥⊥ B | C. There is no corresponding undirected graph over the same three vari-. ables that is a perfect map.. Conversely, consider the undirected graph over four variables shown in Fig-. ure 8.36. This graph exhibits the properties A ⊥⊥ B | ∅, C ⊥⊥ D | A ∪ B and. A ⊥⊥ B | C ∪ D. There is no directed graph over four variables that implies the same. set of conditional independence properties.. The graphical framework can be extended in a consistent way to graphs that. include both directed and undirected links. These are called chain graphs (Lauritzen. and Wermuth, 1989; Frydenberg, 1990), and contain the directed and undirected. graphs considered so far as special cases. Although such graphs can represent a. broader class of distributions than either directed or undirected alone, there remain. distributions for which even a chain graph cannot provide a perfect map. Chain. graphs are not discussed further in this book..

Inference in Graphical Models. We turn now to the problem of inference in graphical models, in which some of. the nodes in a graph are clamped to observed values, and we wish to compute the. posterior distributions of one or more subsets of other nodes. As we shall see, we. can exploit the graphical structure both to find efficient algorithms for inference, and. 394. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.37 A graphical representation of Bayes’.

Specifically, we shall see that. many algorithms can be expressed in terms of the propagation of local messages. around the graph. In this section, we shall focus primarily on techniques for exact. inference, and in Chapter 10 we shall consider a number of approximate inference. algorithms.. To start with, let us consider the graphical interpretation of Bayes’ theorem.. Suppose we decompose the joint distribution p(x, y) over two variables x and y into. a product of factors in the form p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x). This can be represented by. the directed graph shown in Figure 8.37(a). Now suppose we observe the value of. y, as indicated by the shaded node in Figure 8.37(b). We can view the marginal. distribution p(x) as a prior over the latent variable x, and our goal is to infer the. corresponding posterior distribution over x. Using the sum and product rules of. probability we can evaluate. p(y) =. p(y|x)p(x). x. which can then be used in Bayes’ theorem to calculate. p(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x). p(y). (8.47). (8.48). Thus the joint distribution is now expressed in terms of p(y) and p(x|y). From a. graphical perspective, the joint distribution p(x, y) is now represented by the graph. shown in Figure 8.37(c), in which the direction of the arrow is reversed. This is the. simplest example of an inference problem for a graphical model.. "
157,8.4.1,Inference on a chain,"Now consider a more complex problem involving the chain of nodes of the form. shown in Figure 8.32. This example will lay the foundation for a discussion of exact. inference in more general graphs later in this section.. Specifically, we shall consider the undirected graph in Figure 8.32(b). We have. already seen that the directed chain can be transformed into an equivalent undirected. chain. Because the directed graph does not have any nodes with more than one. parent, this does not require the addition of any extra links, and the directed and. undirected versions of this graph express exactly the same set of conditional inde-. pendence statements.. x1. xN. 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. The joint distribution for this graph takes the form. p(x) =. 1. Z. ψ1,2(x1, x2)ψ2,3(x2, x3)··· ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ).. We shall consider the specific case in which the N nodes represent discrete vari-. ables each having K states, in which case each potential function ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn). comprises an K × K table, and so the joint distribution has (N − 1)K 2 parameters.. Let us consider the inference problem of finding the marginal distribution p(xn). for a specific node xn that is part way along the chain. Note that, for the moment,. there are no observed nodes. By definition, the required marginal is obtained by. summing the joint distribution over all variables except xn, so that. 395. (8.49). p(xn) =. xn−1. xn+1. p(x).. xN. (8.50). In a naive implementation, we would first evaluate the joint distribution and. then perform the summations explicitly. The joint distribution can be represented as. a set of numbers, one for each possible value for x. Because there are N variables. each with K states, there are K N values for x and so evaluation and storage of the. joint distribution, as well as marginalization to obtain p(xn), all involve storage and. computation that scale exponentially with the length N of the chain.. We can, however, obtain a much more efficient algorithm by exploiting the con-. ditional independence properties of the graphical model. If we substitute the factor-. ized expression (8.49) for the joint distribution into (8.50), then we can rearrange the. order of the summations and the multiplications to allow the required marginal to be. evaluated much more efficiently. Consider for instance the summation over xN . The. potential ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ) is the only one that depends on xN , and so we can. perform the summation. (8.51). ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ). first to give a function of xN−1. We can then use this to perform the summation. over xN−1, which will involve only this new function together with the potential. ψN−2,N−1(xN−2, xN−1), because this is the only other place that xN−1 appears.. Similarly, the summation over x1 involves only the potential ψ1,2(x1, x2) and so. can be performed separately to give a function of x2, and so on. Because each. summation effectively removes a variable from the distribution, this can be viewed. as the removal of a node from the graph.. If we group the potentials and summations together in this way, we can express. x1. ψ2,3(x2, x3). x2. xN. xn+1. xn−1. 396. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. the desired marginal in the form. p(xn) =. 1. Z. ψ1,2(x1, x2). ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)···. ψn,n+1(xn, xn+1)···. µα(xn). ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ). (8.52). µβ(xn). The reader is encouraged to study this re-ordering carefully as the underlying idea. forms the basis for the later discussion of the general sum-product algorithm. Here. the key concept that we are exploiting is that multiplication is distributive over addi-. tion, so that. ab + ac = a(b + c). (8.53). in which the left-hand side involves three arithmetic operations whereas the right-. hand side reduces this to two operations.. Let us work out the computational cost of evaluating the required marginal using. this re-ordered expression. We have to perform N − 1 summations each of which is. over K states and each of which involves a function of two variables. For instance,. the summation over x1 involves only the function ψ1,2(x1, x2), which is a table of. K × K numbers. We have to sum this table over x1 for each value of x2 and so this. has O(K 2) cost. The resulting vector of K numbers is multiplied by the matrix of. numbers ψ2,3(x2, x3) and so is again O(K 2). Because there are N − 1 summations. and multiplications of this kind, the total cost of evaluating the marginal p(xn) is. O(N K 2). This is linear in the length of the chain, in contrast to the exponential cost. of a naive approach. We have therefore been able to exploit the many conditional. independence properties of this simple graph in order to obtain an efficient calcula-. tion. If the graph had been fully connected, there would have been no conditional. independence properties, and we would have been forced to work directly with the. full joint distribution.. We now give a powerful interpretation of this calculation in terms of the passing. of local messages around on the graph. From (8.52) we see that the expression for the. marginal p(xn) decomposes into the product of two factors times the normalization. constant. p(xn) =. µα(xn)µβ(xn).. (8.54). 1. Z. We shall interpret µα(xn) as a message passed forwards along the chain from node. xn−1 to node xn. Similarly, µβ(xn) can be viewed as a message passed backwards. x1. xn−1. xn−1. Figure 8.38 The marginal distribution. p(xn) for a node xn along the chain is ob-. tained by multiplying the two messages. µα(xn) and µβ(xn), and then normaliz-. ing. These messages can themselves. be evaluated recursively by passing mes-. sages from both ends of the chain to-. wards node xn.. x1. 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. µα(xn−1). µα(xn). µβ(xn). µβ(xn+1). xn−1. xn. xn+1. 397. xN. (8.55). (8.56). along the chain to node xn from node xn+1. Note that each of the messages com-. prises a set of K values, one for each choice of xn, and so the product of two mes-. sages should be interpreted as the point-wise multiplication of the elements of the. two messages to give another set of K values.. The message µα(xn) can be evaluated recursively because. µα(xn) =. We therefore first evaluate. ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn). xn−2. ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)µα(xn−1).. µα(x2) =. ψ1,2(x1, x2). and then apply (8.55) repeatedly until we reach the desired node. Note carefully the. structure of the message passing equation. The outgoing message µα(xn) in (8.55). is obtained by multiplying the incoming message µα(xn−1) by the local potential. involving the node variable and the outgoing variable and then summing over the. node variable.. Similarly, the message µβ(xn) can be evaluated recursively by starting with. node xN and using. µβ(xn) =. ψn+1,n(xn+1, xn). xn+2. xn+1. ψn+1,n(xn+1, xn)µβ(xn+1).. (8.57). xn+1. This recursive message passing is illustrated in Figure 8.38. The normalization con-. stant Z is easily evaluated by summing the right-hand side of (8.54) over all states. of xn, an operation that requires only O(K) computation.. Graphs of the form shown in Figure 8.38 are called Markov chains, and the. corresponding message passing equations represent an example of the Chapman-. Kolmogorov equations for Markov processes (Papoulis, 1984).. 398. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Now suppose we wish to evaluate the marginals p(xn) for every node n ∈. {1, . . . , N} in the chain. Simply applying the above procedure separately for each. node will have computational cost that is O(N 2M 2). However, such an approach. would be very wasteful of computation. For instance, to find p(x1) we need to prop-. agate a message µβ(·) from node xN back to node x2. Similarly, to evaluate p(x2). we need to propagate a messages µβ(·) from node xN back to node x3. This will. involve much duplicated computation because most of the messages will be identical. in the two cases.. Suppose instead we first launch a message µβ(xN−1) starting from node xN. and propagate corresponding messages all the way back to node x1, and suppose we. similarly launch a message µα(x2) starting from node x1 and propagate the corre-. sponding messages all the way forward to node xN . Provided we store all of the. intermediate messages along the way, then any node can evaluate its marginal sim-. ply by applying (8.54). The computational cost is only twice that for finding the. marginal of a single node, rather than N times as much. Observe that a message. has passed once in each direction across each link in the graph. Note also that the. normalization constant Z need be evaluated only once, using any convenient node.. If some of the nodes in the graph are observed, then the corresponding variables. are simply clamped to their observed values and there is no summation. To see. this, note that the effect of clamping a variable xn to an observed value. xn can. be expressed by multiplying the joint distribution by (one or more copies of) an. additional function I(xn,. xn and the value. 0 otherwise. One such function can then be absorbed into each of the potentials that. contain xn. Summations over xn then contain only one term in which xn =. xn), which takes the value 1 when xn =. xn.. Exercise 8.15. Chapter 9. Now suppose we wish to calculate the joint distribution p(xn−1, xn) for two. neighbouring nodes on the chain. This is similar to the evaluation of the marginal. for a single node, except that there are now two variables that are not summed out.. A few moments thought will show that the required joint distribution can be written. in the form. p(xn−1, xn) =. 1. Z. µα(xn−1)ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)µβ(xn).. (8.58). Thus we can obtain the joint distributions over all of the sets of variables in each. of the potentials directly once we have completed the message passing required to. obtain the marginals.. This is a useful result because in practice we may wish to use parametric forms. for the clique potentials, or equivalently for the conditional distributions if we started. from a directed graph. In order to learn the parameters of these potentials in situa-. tions where not all of the variables are observed, we can employ the EM algorithm,. and it turns out that the local joint distributions of the cliques, conditioned on any. observed data, is precisely what is needed in the E step. We shall consider some. examples of this in detail in Chapter 13.. "
158,8.4.2,Trees,"We have seen that exact inference on a graph comprising a chain of nodes can be. performed efficiently in time that is linear in the number of nodes, using an algorithm. 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. 399. Figure 8.39 Examples. tree-. structured graphs, showing (a) an. undirected tree, (b) a directed tree,. and (c) a directed polytree.. of. (a). (b). (c). Exercise 8.18. that can be interpreted in terms of messages passed along the chain. More generally,. inference can be performed efficiently using local message passing on a broader. class of graphs called trees. In particular, we shall shortly generalize the message. passing formalism derived above for chains to give the sum-product algorithm, which. provides an efficient framework for exact inference in tree-structured graphs.. In the case of an undirected graph, a tree is defined as a graph in which there. is one, and only one, path between any pair of nodes. Such graphs therefore do not. have loops. In the case of directed graphs, a tree is defined such that there is a single. node, called the root, which has no parents, and all other nodes have one parent. If. we convert a directed tree into an undirected graph, we see that the moralization step. will not add any links as all nodes have at most one parent, and as a consequence the. corresponding moralized graph will be an undirected tree. Examples of undirected. and directed trees are shown in Figure 8.39(a) and 8.39(b). Note that a distribution. represented as a directed tree can easily be converted into one represented by an. undirected tree, and vice versa.. If there are nodes in a directed graph that have more than one parent, but there is. still only one path (ignoring the direction of the arrows) between any two nodes, then. the graph is a called a polytree, as illustrated in Figure 8.39(c). Such a graph will. have more than one node with the property of having no parents, and furthermore,. the corresponding moralized undirected graph will have loops.. "
159,8.4.3,Factor graphs,"The sum-product algorithm that we derive in the next section is applicable to. undirected and directed trees and to polytrees. It can be cast in a particularly simple. and general form if we first introduce a new graphical construction called a factor. graph (Frey, 1998; Kschischnang et al., 2001).. Both directed and undirected graphs allow a global function of several vari-. ables to be expressed as a product of factors over subsets of those variables. Factor. graphs make this decomposition explicit by introducing additional nodes for the fac-. tors themselves in addition to the nodes representing the variables. They also allow. us to be more explicit about the details of the factorization, as we shall see.. Let us write the joint distribution over a set of variables in the form of a product. of factors. where xs denotes a subset of the variables. For convenience, we shall denote the. p(x) =. fs(xs). s. (8.59). 400. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.40 Example of a factor graph, which corresponds. to the factorization (8.60).. x1. x2. x3. fa. fb. fc. fd. individual variables by xi, however, as in earlier discussions, these can comprise. groups of variables (such as vectors or matrices). Each factor fs is a function of a. corresponding set of variables xs.. Directed graphs, whose factorization is defined by (8.5), represent special cases. of (8.59) in which the factors fs(xs) are local conditional distributions. Similarly,. undirected graphs, given by (8.39), are a special case in which the factors are po-. tential functions over the maximal cliques (the normalizing coefficient 1/Z can be. viewed as a factor defined over the empty set of variables).. In a factor graph, there is a node (depicted as usual by a circle) for every variable. in the distribution, as was the case for directed and undirected graphs. There are also. additional nodes (depicted by small squares) for each factor fs(xs) in the joint dis-. tribution. Finally, there are undirected links connecting each factor node to all of the. variables nodes on which that factor depends. Consider, for example, a distribution. that is expressed in terms of the factorization. p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x1, x2)fc(x2, x3)fd(x3).. (8.60). This can be expressed by the factor graph shown in Figure 8.40. Note that there are. two factors fa(x1, x2) and fb(x1, x2) that are defined over the same set of variables.. In an undirected graph, the product of two such factors would simply be lumped. together into the same clique potential. Similarly, fc(x2, x3) and fd(x3) could be. combined into a single potential over x2 and x3. The factor graph, however, keeps. such factors explicit and so is able to convey more detailed information about the. underlying factorization.. x1. x2. x1. x2. x1. f. x3. (b). x3.

A different factor graph representing the same distribution with factors fa(x1) = p(x1), fb(x2) = p(x2) and. fc(x1, x2, x3) = p(x3|x1, x2).. Factor graphs are said to be bipartite because they consist of two distinct kinds. of nodes, and all links go between nodes of opposite type. In general, factor graphs. can therefore always be drawn as two rows of nodes (variable nodes at the top and. factor nodes at the bottom) with links between the rows, as shown in the example in. Figure 8.40. In some situations, however, other ways of laying out the graph may. be more intuitive, for example when the factor graph is derived from a directed or. undirected graph, as we shall see.. If we are given a distribution that is expressed in terms of an undirected graph,. then we can readily convert it to a factor graph. To do this, we create variable nodes. corresponding to the nodes in the original undirected graph, and then create addi-. tional factor nodes corresponding to the maximal cliques xs. The factors fs(xs) are. then set equal to the clique potentials. Note that there may be several different factor. graphs that correspond to the same undirected graph. These concepts are illustrated. in Figure 8.41.. Similarly, to convert a directed graph to a factor graph, we simply create variable. nodes in the factor graph corresponding to the nodes of the directed graph, and then. create factor nodes corresponding to the conditional distributions, and then finally. add the appropriate links. Again, there can be multiple factor graphs all of which. correspond to the same directed graph. The conversion of a directed graph to a. factor graph is illustrated in Figure 8.42.. We have already noted the importance of tree-structured graphs for performing. efficient inference. If we take a directed or undirected tree and convert it into a factor. graph, then the result will again be a tree (in other words, the factor graph will have. no loops, and there will be one and only one path connecting any two nodes). In. the case of a directed polytree, conversion to an undirected graph results in loops. due to the moralization step, whereas conversion to a factor graph again results in a. tree, as illustrated in Figure 8.43.. In fact, local cycles in a directed graph due to. links connecting parents of a node can be removed on conversion to a factor graph. by defining the appropriate factor function, as shown in Figure 8.44.. We have seen that multiple different factor graphs can represent the same di-. rected or undirected graph. This allows factor graphs to be more specific about the. 402. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. (a). (b).

It should. be emphasized that the factorization in (c) does not correspond to any conditional. independence properties.. "
160,8.4.4,The sum-product algorithm,"We shall now make use of the factor graph framework to derive a powerful class. of efficient, exact inference algorithms that are applicable to tree-structured graphs.. Here we shall focus on the problem of evaluating local marginals over nodes or. subsets of nodes, which will lead us to the sum-product algorithm. Later we shall. modify the technique to allow the most probable state to be found, giving rise to the. max-sum algorithm.. Also we shall suppose that all of the variables in the model are discrete, and. so marginalization corresponds to performing sums. The framework, however, is. equally applicable to linear-Gaussian models in which case marginalization involves. integration, and we shall consider an example of this in detail when we discuss linear. dynamical systems..

There is an algorithm for exact inference on directed graphs without loops known. as belief propagation (Pearl, 1988; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988), and is equiv-. alent to a special case of the sum-product algorithm. Here we shall consider only the. sum-product algorithm because it is simpler to derive and to apply, as well as being. more general.. We shall assume that the original graph is an undirected tree or a directed tree or. polytree, so that the corresponding factor graph has a tree structure. We first convert. the original graph into a factor graph so that we can deal with both directed and. undirected models using the same framework. Our goal is to exploit the structure of. the graph to achieve two things: (i) to obtain an efficient, exact inference algorithm. for finding marginals; (ii) in situations where several marginals are required to allow. computations to be shared efficiently.. We begin by considering the problem of finding the marginal p(x) for partic-. ular variable node x. For the moment, we shall suppose that all of the variables. are hidden. Later we shall see how to modify the algorithm to incorporate evidence. corresponding to observed variables. By definition, the marginal is obtained by sum-. ming the joint distribution over all variables except x so that. p(x) =. p(x). (8.61). where x \ x denotes the set of variables in x with variable x omitted. The idea is. to substitute for p(x) using the factor graph expression (8.59) and then interchange. summations and products in order to obtain an efficient algorithm. Consider the. fragment of graph shown in Figure 8.46 in which we see that the tree structure of. the graph allows us to partition the factors in the joint distribution into groups, with. one group associated with each of the factor nodes that is a neighbour of the variable. node x. We see that the joint distribution can be written as a product of the form. p(x) =. Fs(x, Xs). (8.62). s∈ne(x). ne(x) denotes the set of factor nodes that are neighbours of x, and Xs denotes the. set of all variables in the subtree connected to the variable node x via the factor node. x. s.

Substituting (8.62) into (8.61) and interchanging the sums and products, we ob-. tain. p(x) =. Fs(x, Xs). s∈ne(x). s∈ne(x). µfs→x(x).. µfs→x(x) ≡. Xs. Fs(x, Xs). Here we have introduced a set of functions µfs→x(x), defined by. which can be viewed as messages from the factor nodes fs to the variable node x.. We see that the required marginal p(x) is given by the product of all the incoming. messages arriving at node x.. In order to evaluate these messages, we again turn to Figure 8.46 and note that. each factor Fs(x, Xs) is described by a factor (sub-)graph and so can itself be fac-. torized. In particular, we can write. Fs(x, Xs) = fs(x, x1, . . . , xM )G1 (x1, Xs1) . . . GM (xM , XsM ). (8.65). where, for convenience, we have denoted the variables associated with factor fx, in. addition to x, by x1, . . . , xM . This factorization is illustrated in Figure 8.47. Note. that the set of variables {x, x1, . . . , xM} is the set of variables on which the factor. fs depends, and so it can also be denoted xs, using the notation of (8.59).. Substituting (8.65) into (8.64) we obtain. µfs→x(x) =. fs(x, x1, . . . , xM ). fs(x, x1, . . . , xM ). m∈ne(fs)\x. Gm(xm, Xsm). Xxm. µxm→fs(xm). (8.66). x1. xM. m∈ne(fs)\x. Xsm. where ne(fs) denotes the set of variable nodes that are neighbours of the factor node. fs, and ne(fs) \ x denotes the same set but with node x removed. Here we have. defined the following messages from variable nodes to factor nodes. µxm→fs(xm) ≡. Gm(xm, Xsm).. (8.67). We have therefore introduced two distinct kinds of message, those that go from factor. nodes to variable nodes denoted µf→x(x), and those that go from variable nodes to. factor nodes denoted µx→f (x). In each case, we see that messages passed along a. link are always a function of the variable associated with the variable node that link. connects to.. The result (8.66) says that to evaluate the message sent by a factor node to a vari-. able node along the link connecting them, take the product of the incoming messages. along all other links coming into the factor node, multiply by the factor associated. with that node, and then marginalize over all of the variables associated with the. incoming messages. This is illustrated in Figure 8.47. It is important to note that. a factor node can send a message to a variable node once it has received incoming. messages from all other neighbouring variable nodes.. Finally, we derive an expression for evaluating the messages from variable nodes. to factor nodes, again by making use of the (sub-)graph factorization. From Fig-. ure 8.48, we see that term Gm(xm, Xsm) associated with node xm is given by a. product of terms Fl(xm, Xml) each associated with one of the factor nodes fl that is. linked to node xm (excluding node fs), so that. Gm(xm, Xsm) =. Fl(xm, Xml). (8.68). l∈ne(xm)\fs. where the product is taken over all neighbours of node xm except for node fs. Note. that each of the factors Fl(xm, Xml) represents a subtree of the original graph of. precisely the same kind as introduced in (8.62). Substituting (8.68) into (8.67), we.

Xml. µfl→xm(xm). (8.69). l∈ne(xm)\fs. l∈ne(xm)\fs. where we have used the definition (8.64) of the messages passed from factor nodes to. variable nodes. Thus to evaluate the message sent by a variable node to an adjacent. factor node along the connecting link, we simply take the product of the incoming. messages along all of the other links. Note that any variable node that has only. two neighbours performs no computation but simply passes messages through un-. changed. Also, we note that a variable node can send a message to a factor node. once it has received incoming messages from all other neighbouring factor nodes.. Recall that our goal is to calculate the marginal for variable node x, and that this. marginal is given by the product of incoming messages along all of the links arriving. at that node. Each of these messages can be computed recursively in terms of other. messages. In order to start this recursion, we can view the node x as the root of the. tree and begin at the leaf nodes. From the definition (8.69), we see that if a leaf node. is a variable node, then the message that it sends along its one and only link is given. by. (8.70). as illustrated in Figure 8.49(a). Similarly, if the leaf node is a factor node, we see. from (8.66) that the message sent should take the form. µx→f (x) = 1. µf→x(x) = f(x). (8.71). Figure 8.49 The sum-product algorithm. begins with messages sent. by the leaf nodes, which de-. pend on whether the leaf. node is (a) a variable node,. or (b) a factor node.. µx→f (x) = 1. µf→x(x) = f(x). x. f. f. x. (a). (b). 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. 407. as illustrated in Figure 8.49(b).. At this point, it is worth pausing to summarize the particular version of the sum-. product algorithm obtained so far for evaluating the marginal p(x). We start by. viewing the variable node x as the root of the factor graph and initiating messages. at the leaves of the graph using (8.70) and (8.71). The message passing steps (8.66). and (8.69) are then applied recursively until messages have been propagated along. every link, and the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours. Each. node can send a message towards the root once it has received messages from all. of its other neighbours. Once the root node has received messages from all of its. neighbours, the required marginal can be evaluated using (8.63). We shall illustrate. this process shortly.. To see that each node will always receive enough messages to be able to send out. a message, we can use a simple inductive argument as follows. Clearly, for a graph. comprising a variable root node connected directly to several factor leaf nodes, the. algorithm trivially involves sending messages of the form (8.71) directly from the. leaves to the root. Now imagine building up a general graph by adding nodes one at. a time, and suppose that for some particular graph we have a valid algorithm. When. one more (variable or factor) node is added, it can be connected only by a single. link because the overall graph must remain a tree, and so the new node will be a leaf. node. It therefore sends a message to the node to which it is linked, which in turn. will therefore receive all the messages it requires in order to send its own message. towards the root, and so again we have a valid algorithm, thereby completing the. proof.. Now suppose we wish to find the marginals for every variable node in the graph.. This could be done by simply running the above algorithm afresh for each such node.. However, this would be very wasteful as many of the required computations would. be repeated. We can obtain a much more efficient procedure by ‘overlaying’ these. multiple message passing algorithms to obtain the general sum-product algorithm. as follows. Arbitrarily pick any (variable or factor) node and designate it as the. root. Propagate messages from the leaves to the root as before. At this point, the. root node will have received messages from all of its neighbours. It can therefore. send out messages to all of its neighbours. These in turn will then have received. messages from all of their neighbours and so can send out messages along the links. going away from the root, and so on. In this way, messages are passed outwards. from the root all the way to the leaves. By now, a message will have passed in. both directions across every link in the graph, and every node will have received. a message from all of its neighbours. Again a simple inductive argument can be. used to verify the validity of this message passing protocol. Because every variable. node will have received messages from all of its neighbours, we can readily calculate. the marginal distribution for every variable in the graph. The number of messages. that have to be computed is given by twice the number of links in the graph and. so involves only twice the computation involved in finding a single marginal. By. comparison, if we had run the sum-product algorithm separately for each node, the. amount of computation would grow quadratically with the size of the graph. Note. that this algorithm is in fact independent of which node was designated as the root,. Exercise 8.20. 408. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.50 The sum-product algorithm can be viewed. purely in terms of messages sent out by factor. nodes to other factor nodes.. In this example,. the outgoing message shown by the blue arrow. is obtained by taking the product of all the in-. coming messages shown by green arrows, mul-. tiplying by the factor fs, and marginalizing over. the variables x1 and x2.. x1. x2. fs. x3. and indeed the notion of one node having a special status was introduced only as a. convenient way to explain the message passing protocol.. Next suppose we wish to find the marginal distributions p(xs) associated with. the sets of variables belonging to each of the factors. By a similar argument to that. used above, it is easy to see that the marginal associated with a factor is given by the. product of messages arriving at the factor node and the local factor at that node. Exercise 8.21. p(xs) = fs(xs). i∈ne(fs). µxi→fs(xi). (8.72). If the factors are. in complete analogy with the marginals at the variable nodes.. parameterized functions and we wish to learn the values of the parameters using. the EM algorithm, then these marginals are precisely the quantities we will need to. calculate in the E step, as we shall see in detail when we discuss the hidden Markov. model in Chapter 13.. The message sent by a variable node to a factor node, as we have seen, is simply. the product of the incoming messages on other links. We can if we wish view the. sum-product algorithm in a slightly different form by eliminating messages from. variable nodes to factor nodes and simply considering messages that are sent out by. factor nodes. This is most easily seen by considering the example in Figure 8.50.. So far, we have rather neglected the issue of normalization. If the factor graph. was derived from a directed graph, then the joint distribution is already correctly nor-. malized, and so the marginals obtained by the sum-product algorithm will similarly. be normalized correctly. However, if we started from an undirected graph, then in. general there will be an unknown normalization coefficient 1/Z. As with the simple. chain example of Figure 8.38, this is easily handled by working with an unnormal-. p(x)/Z. We first run the. ized version. p(xi). The. sum-product algorithm to find the corresponding unnormalized marginals. coefficient 1/Z is then easily obtained by normalizing any one of these marginals,. and this is computationally efficient because the normalization is done over a single. variable rather than over the entire set of variables as would be required to normalize. p(x) directly.. p(x) of the joint distribution, where p(x) =. At this point, it may be helpful to consider a simple example to illustrate the. operation of the sum-product algorithm. Figure 8.51 shows a simple 4-node factor. x2. x1. x2. x2. 409. x3. (8.73).

In order to apply the sum-product algorithm to this graph, let us designate node x3. as the root, in which case there are two leaf nodes x1 and x4. Starting with the leaf. nodes, we then have the following sequence of six messages. The direction of flow of these messages is illustrated in Figure 8.52. Once this mes-. sage propagation is complete, we can then propagate messages from the root node. out to the leaf nodes, and these are given by. fa(x1, x2). µx1→fa(x1) = 1. µfa→x2(x2) =. µx4→fc(x4) = 1. µfc→x2(x2) =. µx2→fb(x2) = µfa→x2(x2)µfc→x2(x2). µfb→x3(x3) =. fb(x2, x3)µx2→fb.. fc(x2, x4). x4. x3. fb(x2, x3). µx3→fb(x3) = 1. µfb→x2(x2) =. µx2→fa(x2) = µfb→x2(x2)µfc→x2(x2). µfa→x1(x1) =. µx2→fc(x2) = µfa→x2(x2)µfb→x2(x2). µfc→x4(x4) =. fa(x1, x2)µx2→fa(x2). fc(x2, x4)µx2→fc(x2).. x4. x4. x3. x1. x3. x1. x1. x2. x1. x3. x4.

One message has now passed in each direction across each link, and we can now. evaluate the marginals. As a simple check, let us verify that the marginal p(x2) is. given by the correct expression. Using (8.63) and substituting for the messages using. the above results, we have. p(x2) = µfa→x2(x2)µfb→x2(x2)µfc→x2(x2). fb(x2, x3). fa(x1, x2). fc(x2, x4). x4. fa(x1, x2)fb(x2, x3)fc(x2, x4). p(x).

In most. practical applications, a subset of the variables will be observed, and we wish to cal-. culate posterior distributions conditioned on these observations. Observed nodes are. easily handled within the sum-product algorithm as follows. Suppose we partition x. into hidden variables h and observed variables v, and that the observed value of v. vi),. is denoted. where I(v,. v) = 0 otherwise. This product corresponds. v). By run-. to p(h, v =. ning the sum-product algorithm, we can efficiently calculate the posterior marginals. p(hi|v =. v) up to a normalization coefficient whose value can be found efficiently. using a local computation.

161,8.4.5,The max-sum algorithm,"The sum-product algorithm allows us to take a joint distribution p(x) expressed. as a factor graph and efficiently find marginals over the component variables. Two. other common tasks are to find a setting of the variables that has the largest prob-. ability and to find the value of that probability. These can be addressed through a. closely related algorithm called max-sum, which can be viewed as an application of. dynamic programming in the context of graphical models (Cormen et al., 2001).. A simple approach to finding latent variable values having high probability. would be to run the sum-product algorithm to obtain the marginals p(xi) for ev-. ery variable, and then, for each marginal in turn, to find the value x. i that maximizes. that marginal. However, this would give the set of values that are individually the. most probable. In practice, we typically wish to find the set of values that jointly. have the largest probability, in other words the vector xmax that maximizes the joint. distribution, so that. xmax = arg max. p(x). for which the corresponding value of the joint probability will be given by. x. p(xmax) = max. x. p(x).. (8.87). (8.88). In general, xmax is not the same as the set of x. i values, as we can easily show using. a simple example. Consider the joint distribution p(x, y) over two binary variables. x, y ∈ {0, 1} given in Table 8.1. The joint distribution is maximized by setting x =. 1 and y = 0, corresponding the value 0.4. However, the marginal for p(x), obtained. by summing over both values of y, is given by p(x = 0) = 0.6 and p(x = 1) = 0.4,. and similarly the marginal for y is given by p(y = 0) = 0.7 and p(y = 1) = 0.3,. and so the marginals are maximized by x = 0 and y = 0, which corresponds to a. value of 0.3 for the joint distribution. In fact, it is not difficult to construct examples. for which the set of individually most probable values has probability zero under the. joint distribution.. We therefore seek an efficient algorithm for finding the value of x that maxi-. mizes the joint distribution p(x) and that will allow us to obtain the value of the. joint distribution at its maximum. To address the second of these problems, we shall. simply write out the max operator in terms of its components. max. x. p(x) = max. x1. . . . max. xM. p(x). (8.89). Exercise 8.27. 412. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. where M is the total number of variables, and then substitute for p(x) using its. expansion in terms of a product of factors. In deriving the sum-product algorithm,. we made use of the distributive law (8.53) for multiplication. Here we make use of. the analogous law for the max operator. max(ab, ac) = a max(b, c). (8.90). which holds if a � 0 (as will always be the case for the factors in a graphical model).. This allows us to exchange products with maximizations.. Consider first the simple example of a chain of nodes described by (8.49). The. evaluation of the probability maximum can be written as. max. x. p(x) =. 1. Z. 1. Z. max. x1. max. x1. ··· max. ψ1,2(x1, x2). xN. [ψ1,2(x1, x2)··· ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN )]. ··· max. ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN ). xN. As with the calculation of marginals, we see that exchanging the max and product. operators results in a much more efficient computation, and one that is easily inter-. preted in terms of messages passed from node xN backwards along the chain to node. x1.. We can readily generalize this result to arbitrary tree-structured factor graphs. by substituting the expression (8.59) for the factor graph expansion into (8.89) and. again exchanging maximizations with products. The structure of this calculation is. identical to that of the sum-product algorithm, and so we can simply translate those. results into the present context. In particular, suppose that we designate a particular. variable node as the ‘root’ of the graph. Then we start a set of messages propagating. inwards from the leaves of the tree towards the root, with each node sending its. message towards the root once it has received all incoming messages from its other. neighbours. The final maximization is performed over the product of all messages. arriving at the root node, and gives the maximum value for p(x). This could be called. the max-product algorithm and is identical to the sum-product algorithm except that. summations are replaced by maximizations. Note that at this stage, messages have. been sent from leaves to the root, but not in the other direction.. In practice, products of many small probabilities can lead to numerical under-. flow problems, and so it is convenient to work with the logarithm of the joint distri-. bution. The logarithm is a monotonic function, so that if a > b then ln a > ln b, and. hence the max operator and the logarithm function can be interchanged, so that. ln. max. x. p(x). = max. x. ln p(x).. The distributive property is preserved because. max(a + b, a + c) = a + max(b, c).. (8.91). (8.92). Thus taking the logarithm simply has the effect of replacing the products in the. max-product algorithm with sums, and so we obtain the max-sum algorithm. From. (8.93). (8.94). (8.95). (8.96). (8.97). s∈ne(x). 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. 413. the results (8.66) and (8.69) derived earlier for the sum-product algorithm, we can. readily write down the max-sum algorithm in terms of message passing simply by. replacing ‘sum’ with ‘max’ and replacing products with sums of logarithms to give. µf→x(x) = max. x1,...,xM. ln f(x, x1, . . . , xM ) +. µxm→f (xm). m∈ne(fs)\x. µx→f (x) =. l∈ne(x)\f. µfl→x(x).. The initial messages sent by the leaf nodes are obtained by analogy with (8.70) and. (8.71) and are given by. while at the root node the maximum probability can then be computed, by analogy. with (8.63), using. µx→f (x) = 0. µf→x(x) = ln f(x). pmax = max. x. µfs→x(x). So far, we have seen how to find the maximum of the joint distribution by prop-. agating messages from the leaves to an arbitrarily chosen root node. The result will. be the same irrespective of which node is chosen as the root. Now we turn to the. second problem of finding the configuration of the variables for which the joint dis-. tribution attains this maximum value. So far, we have sent messages from the leaves. to the root. The process of evaluating (8.97) will also give the value xmax for the. most probable value of the root node variable, defined by. xmax = arg max. x. µfs→x(x). s∈ne(x). (8.98). At this point, we might be tempted simply to continue with the message passing al-. gorithm and send messages from the root back out to the leaves, using (8.93) and. (8.94), then apply (8.98) to all of the remaining variable nodes. However, because. we are now maximizing rather than summing, it is possible that there may be mul-. tiple configurations of x all of which give rise to the maximum value for p(x). In. such cases, this strategy can fail because it is possible for the individual variable. values obtained by maximizing the product of messages at each node to belong to. different maximizing configurations, giving an overall configuration that no longer. corresponds to a maximum.. The problem can be resolved by adopting a rather different kind of message. passing from the root node to the leaves. To see how this works, let us return once. again to the simple chain example of N variables x1, . . . , xN each having K states,. 414. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Figure 8.53 A lattice, or trellis, diagram show-. ing explicitly the K possible states (one per row. of the diagram) for each of the variables xn in the. chain model.. In this illustration K = 3. The ar-. row shows the direction of message passing in the. max-product algorithm. For every state k of each. variable xn (corresponding to column n of the dia-. gram) the function φ(xn) defines a unique state at. the previous variable, indicated by the black lines.. The two paths through the lattice correspond to. configurations that give the global maximum of the. joint probability distribution, and either of these. can be found by tracing back along the black lines. in the opposite direction to the arrow.. k = 1. k = 2. k = 3. n − 2. n − 1. n. n + 1. corresponding to the graph shown in Figure 8.38. Suppose we take node xN to be. the root node. Then in the first phase, we propagate messages from the leaf node x1. to the root node using. µxn→fn,n+1(xn) = µfn−1,n→xn(xn). µfn−1,n→xn(xn) = max. xn−1. ln fn−1,n(xn−1, xn) + µxn−1→f n−1,n(xn). which follow from applying (8.94) and (8.93) to this particular graph. The initial. message sent from the leaf node is simply. The most probable value for xN is then given by. µx1→f1,2(x1) = 0.. N = arg max. xmax. xN. µfN−1,N→xN (xN ). (8.99). (8.100). Now we need to determine the states of the previous variables that correspond to the. same maximizing configuration. This can be done by keeping track of which values. of the variables gave rise to the maximum state of each variable, in other words by. storing quantities given by. φ(xn) = arg max. xn−1. ln fn−1,n(xn−1, xn) + µxn−1→f n−1,n(xn). (8.101). To understand better what is happening, it is helpful to represent the chain of vari-. ables in terms of a lattice or trellis diagram as shown in Figure 8.53. Note that this. is not a probabilistic graphical model because the nodes represent individual states. of variables, while each variable corresponds to a column of such states in the di-. agram. For each state of a given variable, there is a unique state of the previous. variable that maximizes the probability (ties are broken either systematically or at. random), corresponding to the function φ(xn) given by (8.101), and this is indicated. 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. 415. by the lines connecting the nodes. Once we know the most probable value of the fi-. nal node xN , we can then simply follow the link back to find the most probable state. of node xN−1 and so on back to the initial node x1. This corresponds to propagating. a message back down the chain using. n−1 = φ(xmax. n ). xmax. (8.102). and is known as back-tracking. Note that there could be several values of xn−1 all. of which give the maximum value in (8.101). Provided we chose one of these values. when we do the back-tracking, we are assured of a globally consistent maximizing. configuration.. In Figure 8.53, we have indicated two paths, each of which we shall suppose. corresponds to a global maximum of the joint probability distribution. If k = 2. and k = 3 each represent possible values of xmax. N , then starting from either state. and tracing back along the black lines, which corresponds to iterating (8.102), we. obtain a valid global maximum configuration. Note that if we had run a forward. pass of max-sum message passing followed by a backward pass and then applied. (8.98) at each node separately, we could end up selecting some states from one path. and some from the other path, giving an overall configuration that is not a global. maximizer. We see that it is necessary instead to keep track of the maximizing states. during the forward pass using the functions φ(xn) and then use back-tracking to find. a consistent solution.. The extension to a general tree-structured factor graph should now be clear. If. a message is sent from a factor node f to a variable node x, a maximization is. performed over all other variable nodes x1, . . . , xM that are neighbours of that fac-. tor node, using (8.93). When we perform this maximization, we keep a record of. which values of the variables x1, . . . , xM gave rise to the maximum. Then in the. back-tracking step, having found xmax, we can then use these stored values to as-. sign consistent maximizing states xmax. M . The max-sum algorithm, with. back-tracking, gives an exact maximizing configuration for the variables provided. the factor graph is a tree. An important application of this technique is for finding. the most probable sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model, in which. case it is known as the Viterbi algorithm.. , . . . , xmax. 1. As with the sum-product algorithm, the inclusion of evidence in the form of. observed variables is straightforward. The observed variables are clamped to their. observed values, and the maximization is performed over the remaining hidden vari-. ables. This can be shown formally by including identity functions for the observed. variables into the factor functions, as we did for the sum-product algorithm.. It is interesting to compare max-sum with the iterated conditional modes (ICM). algorithm described on page 389. Each step in ICM is computationally simpler be-. cause the ‘messages’ that are passed from one node to the next comprise a single. value consisting of the new state of the node for which the conditional distribution. is maximized. The max-sum algorithm is more complex because the messages are. functions of node variables x and hence comprise a set of K values for each pos-. sible state of x. Unlike max-sum, however, ICM is not guaranteed to find a global. maximum even for tree-structured graphs.. Section 13.2. 416. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. "
162,8.4.6,Exact inference in general graphs,"The sum-product and max-sum algorithms provide efficient and exact solutions. to inference problems in tree-structured graphs. For many practical applications,. however, we have to deal with graphs having loops.. The message passing framework can be generalized to arbitrary graph topolo-. gies, giving an exact inference procedure known as the junction tree algorithm (Lau-. ritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Jordan, 2007). Here we give a brief outline of the. key steps involved. This is not intended to convey a detailed understanding of the. algorithm, but rather to give a flavour of the various stages involved. If the starting. point is a directed graph, it is first converted to an undirected graph by moraliza-. tion, whereas if starting from an undirected graph this step is not required. Next the. graph is triangulated, which involves finding chord-less cycles containing four or. more nodes and adding extra links to eliminate such chord-less cycles. For instance,. in the graph in Figure 8.36, the cycle A–C–B–D–A is chord-less a link could be. added between A and B or alternatively between C and D. Note that the joint dis-. tribution for the resulting triangulated graph is still defined by a product of the same. potential functions, but these are now considered to be functions over expanded sets. of variables. Next the triangulated graph is used to construct a new tree-structured. undirected graph called a join tree, whose nodes correspond to the maximal cliques. of the triangulated graph, and whose links connect pairs of cliques that have vari-. ables in common. The selection of which pairs of cliques to connect in this way is. important and is done so as to give a maximal spanning tree defined as follows. Of. all possible trees that link up the cliques, the one that is chosen is one for which the. weight of the tree is largest, where the weight for a link is the number of nodes shared. by the two cliques it connects, and the weight for the tree is the sum of the weights. for the links. If the tree is condensed, so that any clique that is a subset of another. clique is absorbed into the larger clique, this gives a junction tree. As a consequence. of the triangulation step, the resulting tree satisfies the running intersection property,. which means that if a variable is contained in two cliques, then it must also be con-. tained in every clique on the path that connects them. This ensures that inference. about variables will be consistent across the graph. Finally, a two-stage message. passing algorithm, essentially equivalent to the sum-product algorithm, can now be. applied to this junction tree in order to find marginals and conditionals. Although. the junction tree algorithm sounds complicated, at its heart is the simple idea that. we have used already of exploiting the factorization properties of the distribution to. allow sums and products to be interchanged so that partial summations can be per-. formed, thereby avoiding having to work directly with the joint distribution. The. role of the junction tree is to provide a precise and efficient way to organize these. computations. It is worth emphasizing that this is achieved using purely graphical. operations!. The junction tree is exact for arbitrary graphs and is efficient in the sense that. for a given graph there does not in general exist a computationally cheaper approach.. Unfortunately, the algorithm must work with the joint distributions within each node. (each of which corresponds to a clique of the triangulated graph) and so the compu-. tational cost of the algorithm is determined by the number of variables in the largest. 8.4. Inference in Graphical Models. 417. clique and will grow exponentially with this number in the case of discrete variables.. An important concept is the treewidth of a graph (Bodlaender, 1993), which is de-. fined in terms of the number of variables in the largest clique. In fact, it is defined to. be as one less than the size of the largest clique, to ensure that a tree has a treewidth. of 1. Because there in general there can be multiple different junction trees that can. be constructed from a given starting graph, the treewidth is defined by the junction. tree for which the largest clique has the fewest variables.. If the treewidth of the. original graph is high, the junction tree algorithm becomes impractical.. "
163,8.4.7,Loopy belief propagation,"For many problems of practical interest, it will not be feasible to use exact in-. ference, and so we need to exploit effective approximation methods. An important. class of such approximations, that can broadly be called variational methods, will be. discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Complementing these deterministic approaches is. a wide range of sampling methods, also called Monte Carlo methods, that are based. on stochastic numerical sampling from distributions and that will be discussed at. length in Chapter 11.. Here we consider one simple approach to approximate inference in graphs with. loops, which builds directly on the previous discussion of exact inference in trees.. The idea is simply to apply the sum-product algorithm even though there is no guar-. antee that it will yield good results. This approach is known as loopy belief propa-. gation (Frey and MacKay, 1998) and is possible because the message passing rules. (8.66) and (8.69) for the sum-product algorithm are purely local. However, because. the graph now has cycles, information can flow many times around the graph. For. some models, the algorithm will converge, whereas for others it will not.. In order to apply this approach, we need to define a message passing schedule.. Let us assume that one message is passed at a time on any given link and in any. given direction. Each message sent from a node replaces any previous message sent. in the same direction across the same link and will itself be a function only of the. most recent messages received by that node at previous steps of the algorithm.. We have seen that a message can only be sent across a link from a node when. all other messages have been received by that node across its other links. Because. there are loops in the graph, this raises the problem of how to initiate the message. passing algorithm. To resolve this, we suppose that an initial message given by the. unit function has been passed across every link in each direction. Every node is then. in a position to send a message.. There are now many possible ways to organize the message passing schedule.. For example, the flooding schedule simultaneously passes a message across every. link in both directions at each time step, whereas schedules that pass one message at. a time are called serial schedules.. Following Kschischnang et al. (2001), we will say that a (variable or factor). node a has a message pending on its link to a node b if node a has received any. message on any of its other links since the last time it send a message to b. Thus,. when a node receives a message on one of its links, this creates pending messages. on all of its other links. Only pending messages need to be transmitted because. 418. 8. GRAPHICAL MODELS. Exercise 8.29. other messages would simply duplicate the previous message on the same link. For. graphs that have a tree structure, any schedule that sends only pending messages. will eventually terminate once a message has passed in each direction across every. link. At this point, there are no pending messages, and the product of the received. messages at every variable give the exact marginal. In graphs having loops, however,. the algorithm may never terminate because there might always be pending messages,. although in practice it is generally found to converge within a reasonable time for. most applications. Once the algorithm has converged, or once it has been stopped. if convergence is not observed, the (approximate) local marginals can be computed. using the product of the most recently received incoming messages to each variable. node or factor node on every link.. In some applications, the loopy belief propagation algorithm can give poor re-. sults, whereas in other applications it has proven to be very effective. In particular,. state-of-the-art algorithms for decoding certain kinds of error-correcting codes are. equivalent to loopy belief propagation (Gallager, 1963; Berrou et al., 1993; McEliece. et al., 1998; MacKay and Neal, 1999; Frey, 1998).. "
164,8.4.8,Learning the graph structure,"In our discussion of inference in graphical models, we have assumed that the. structure of the graph is known and fixed. However, there is also interest in go-. ing beyond the inference problem and learning the graph structure itself from data. (Friedman and Koller, 2003). This requires that we define a space of possible struc-. tures as well as a measure that can be used to score each structure.. From a Bayesian viewpoint, we would ideally like to compute a posterior dis-. tribution over graph structures and to make predictions by averaging with respect. to this distribution. If we have a prior p(m) over graphs indexed by m, then the. posterior distribution is given by. p(m|D) ∝ p(m)p(D|m). (8.103). where D is the observed data set. The model evidence p(D|m) then provides the. score for each model. However, evaluation of the evidence involves marginalization. over the latent variables and presents a challenging computational problem for many. models.. Exploring the space of structures can also be problematic. Because the number. of different graph structures grows exponentially with the number of nodes, it is. often necessary to resort to heuristics to find good candidates..

165,9,Mixture Models and EM,"If we define a joint distribution over observed and latent variables, the correspond-. ing distribution of the observed variables alone is obtained by marginalization. This. allows relatively complex marginal distributions over observed variables to be ex-. pressed in terms of more tractable joint distributions over the expanded space of. observed and latent variables. The introduction of latent variables thereby allows. complicated distributions to be formed from simpler components. In this chapter,. we shall see that mixture distributions, such as the Gaussian mixture discussed in. Section 2.3.9, can be interpreted in terms of discrete latent variables. Continuous. latent variables will form the subject of Chapter 12.. As well as providing a framework for building more complex probability dis-. tributions, mixture models can also be used to cluster data. We therefore begin our. discussion of mixture distributions by considering the problem of finding clusters. in a set of data points, which we approach first using a nonprobabilistic technique. called the K-means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982). Then we introduce the latent variable. 423. Section 9.1. 424. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. Section 9.2. Section 9.3. Section 9.4. view of mixture distributions in which the discrete latent variables can be interpreted. as defining assignments of data points to specific components of the mixture. A gen-. eral technique for finding maximum likelihood estimators in latent variable models. is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We first of all use the Gaussian. mixture distribution to motivate the EM algorithm in a fairly informal way, and then. we give a more careful treatment based on the latent variable viewpoint. We shall. see that the K-means algorithm corresponds to a particular nonprobabilistic limit of. EM applied to mixtures of Gaussians. Finally, we discuss EM in some generality.. Gaussian mixture models are widely used in data mining, pattern recognition,. machine learning, and statistical analysis. In many applications, their parameters are. determined by maximum likelihood, typically using the EM algorithm. However, as. we shall see there are some significant limitations to the maximum likelihood ap-. proach, and in Chapter 10 we shall show that an elegant Bayesian treatment can be. given using the framework of variational inference. This requires little additional. computation compared with EM, and it resolves the principal difficulties of maxi-. mum likelihood while also allowing the number of components in the mixture to be. inferred automatically from the data.. N. K. "
166,9.1,K-means Clustering,"We begin by considering the problem of identifying groups, or clusters, of data points. in a multidimensional space. Suppose we have a data set {x1, . . . , xN} consisting. of N observations of a random D-dimensional Euclidean variable x. Our goal is to. partition the data set into some number K of clusters, where we shall suppose for. the moment that the value of K is given. Intuitively, we might think of a cluster as. comprising a group of data points whose inter-point distances are small compared. with the distances to points outside of the cluster. We can formalize this notion by. first introducing a set of D-dimensional vectors µk, where k = 1, . . . , K, in which. µk is a prototype associated with the kth cluster. As we shall see shortly, we can. think of the µk as representing the centres of the clusters. Our goal is then to find. an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of vectors {µk}, such that. the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest vector µk, is. a minimum.. It is convenient at this point to define some notation to describe the assignment. of data points to clusters. For each data point xn, we introduce a corresponding set. of binary indicator variables rnk ∈ {0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K describing which of. the K clusters the data point xn is assigned to, so that if data point xn is assigned to. cluster k then rnk = 1, and rnj = 0 for j = k. This is known as the 1-of-K coding. scheme. We can then define an objective function, sometimes called a distortion. measure, given by. J =. n=1. k=1. rnkxn − µk2. (9.1). which represents the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its. N. which we can easily solve for µk to give. 2. n=1. rnk(xn − µk) = 0. µk =. n rnkxn. n rnk. (9.3). (9.4). The denominator in this expression is equal to the number of points assigned to. cluster k, and so this result has a simple interpretation, namely set µk equal to the. mean of all of the data points xn assigned to cluster k. For this reason, the procedure. is known as the K-means algorithm.. The two phases of re-assigning data points to clusters and re-computing the clus-. ter means are repeated in turn until there is no further change in the assignments (or. until some maximum number of iterations is exceeded). Because each phase reduces. the value of the objective function J, convergence of the algorithm is assured. How-. ever, it may converge to a local rather than global minimum of J. The convergence. properties of the K-means algorithm were studied by MacQueen (1967).. The K-means algorithm is illustrated using the Old Faithful data set in Fig-. ure 9.1. For the purposes of this example, we have made a linear re-scaling of the. data, known as standardizing, such that each of the variables has zero mean and. unit standard deviation. For this example, we have chosen K = 2, and so in this. 9.1. K-means Clustering. 425. assigned vector µk. Our goal is to find values for the {rnk} and the {µk} so as to. minimize J. We can do this through an iterative procedure in which each iteration. involves two successive steps corresponding to successive optimizations with respect. to the rnk and the µk. First we choose some initial values for the µk. Then in the first. phase we minimize J with respect to the rnk, keeping the µk fixed. In the second. phase we minimize J with respect to the µk, keeping rnk fixed. This two-stage. optimization is then repeated until convergence. We shall see that these two stages. of updating rnk and updating µk correspond respectively to the E (expectation) and. M (maximization) steps of the EM algorithm, and to emphasize this we shall use the. terms E step and M step in the context of the K-means algorithm.. Consider first the determination of the rnk. Because J in (9.1) is a linear func-. tion of rnk, this optimization can be performed easily to give a closed form solution.. The terms involving different n are independent and so we can optimize for each. n separately by choosing rnk to be 1 for whichever value of k gives the minimum. value of xn − µk2. In other words, we simply assign the nth data point to the. closest cluster centre. More formally, this can be expressed as. if k = arg minj xn − µj2. otherwise.. rnk =. (9.2). 1. 0. Now consider the optimization of the µk with the rnk held fixed. The objective. function J is a quadratic function of µk, and it can be minimized by setting its. derivative with respect to µk to zero giving. Section 9.4. Exercise 9.1. Appendix A. 426. 9.

A plot of the cost function J given by (9.1) for. the Old Faithful example is shown in Figure 9.2.. Note that we have deliberately chosen poor initial values for the cluster centres. so that the algorithm takes several steps before convergence. In practice, a better. initialization procedure would be to choose the cluster centres µk to be equal to a. random subset of K data points. It is also worth noting that the K-means algorithm. itself is often used to initialize the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model before. applying the EM algorithm.. A direct implementation of the K-means algorithm as discussed here can be. relatively slow, because in each E step it is necessary to compute the Euclidean dis-. tance between every prototype vector and every data point. Various schemes have. been proposed for speeding up the K-means algorithm, some of which are based on. precomputing a data structure such as a tree such that nearby points are in the same. subtree (Ramasubramanian and Paliwal, 1990; Moore, 2000). Other approaches. make use of the triangle inequality for distances, thereby avoiding unnecessary dis-. tance calculations (Hodgson, 1998; Elkan, 2003).. So far, we have considered a batch version of K-means in which the whole data. set is used together to update the prototype vectors. We can also derive an on-line. stochastic algorithm (MacQueen, 1967) by applying the Robbins-Monro procedure. to the problem of finding the roots of the regression function given by the derivatives. of J in (9.1) with respect to µk. This leads to a sequential update in which, for each. data point xn in turn, we update the nearest prototype µk using. Section 9.2.2. Section 2.3.5. Exercise 9.2. µnew. k = µold. k + ηn(xn − µold. k ). (9.5). where ηn is the learning rate parameter, which is typically made to decrease mono-. tonically as more data points are considered.. The K-means algorithm is based on the use of squared Euclidean distance as the. measure of dissimilarity between a data point and a prototype vector. Not only does. this limit the type of data variables that can be considered (it would be inappropriate. for cases where some or all of the variables represent categorical labels for instance),. N. K. 428. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. Section 2.3.7. but it can also make the determination of the cluster means nonrobust to outliers. We. can generalize the K-means algorithm by introducing a more general dissimilarity. measure V(x, x) between two vectors x and x and then minimizing the following. distortion measure. J =. n=1. k=1. rnkV(xn, µk). (9.6). which gives the K-medoids algorithm. The E step again involves, for given cluster. prototypes µk, assigning each data point to the cluster for which the dissimilarity to. the corresponding prototype is smallest. The computational cost of this is O(KN),. as is the case for the standard K-means algorithm. For a general choice of dissimi-. larity measure, the M step is potentially more complex than for K-means, and so it. is common to restrict each cluster prototype to be equal to one of the data vectors as-. signed to that cluster, as this allows the algorithm to be implemented for any choice. of dissimilarity measure V(·,·) so long as it can be readily evaluated. Thus the M. step involves, for each cluster k, a discrete search over the Nk points assigned to that. cluster, which requires O(N 2. One notable feature of the K-means algorithm is that at each iteration, every. data point is assigned uniquely to one, and only one, of the clusters. Whereas some. data points will be much closer to a particular centre µk than to any other centre,. there may be other data points that lie roughly midway between cluster centres. In. the latter case, it is not clear that the hard assignment to the nearest cluster is the. most appropriate. We shall see in the next section that by adopting a probabilistic. approach, we obtain ‘soft’ assignments of data points to clusters in a way that reflects. the level of uncertainty over the most appropriate assignment. This probabilistic. formulation brings with it numerous benefits.. k) evaluations of V(·,·).. "
167,9.1.1,Image segmentation and compression,"As an illustration of the application of the K-means algorithm, we consider. the related problems of image segmentation and image compression. The goal of. segmentation is to partition an image into regions each of which has a reasonably. homogeneous visual appearance or which corresponds to objects or parts of objects. (Forsyth and Ponce, 2003). Each pixel in an image is a point in a 3-dimensional space. comprising the intensities of the red, blue, and green channels, and our segmentation. algorithm simply treats each pixel in the image as a separate data point. Note that. strictly this space is not Euclidean because the channel intensities are bounded by. the interval [0, 1]. Nevertheless, we can apply the K-means algorithm without diffi-. culty. We illustrate the result of running K-means to convergence, for any particular. value of K, by re-drawing the image replacing each pixel vector with the {R, G, B}. intensity triplet given by the centre µk to which that pixel has been assigned. Results. for various values of K are shown in Figure 9.3. We see that for a given value of K,. the algorithm is representing the image using a palette of only K colours. It should. be emphasized that this use of K-means is not a particularly sophisticated approach. to image segmentation, not least because it takes no account of the spatial proximity. of different pixels. The image segmentation problem is in general extremely difficult. K = 2. K = 3. K = 10. Original image. 9.1. K-means Clustering. 429. Figure 9.3 Two examples of the application of the K-means clustering algorithm to image segmentation show-. ing the initial images together with their K-means segmentations obtained using various values of K. This. also illustrates of the use of vector quantization for data compression, in which smaller values of K give higher. compression at the expense of poorer image quality.. and remains the subject of active research and is introduced here simply to illustrate. the behaviour of the K-means algorithm.. We can also use the result of a clustering algorithm to perform data compres-. sion.. It is important to distinguish between lossless data compression, in which. the goal is to be able to reconstruct the original data exactly from the compressed. representation, and lossy data compression, in which we accept some errors in the. reconstruction in return for higher levels of compression than can be achieved in the. lossless case. We can apply the K-means algorithm to the problem of lossy data. compression as follows. For each of the N data points, we store only the identity. k of the cluster to which it is assigned. We also store the values of the K clus-. ter centres µk, which typically requires significantly less data, provided we choose. K  N. Each data point is then approximated by its nearest centre µk. New data. points can similarly be compressed by first finding the nearest µk and then storing. the label k instead of the original data vector. This framework is often called vector. quantization, and the vectors µk are called code-book vectors.. 430. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. K. The image segmentation problem discussed above also provides an illustration. of the use of clustering for data compression. Suppose the original image has N. pixels comprising {R, G, B} values each of which is stored with 8 bits of precision.. Then to transmit the whole image directly would cost 24N bits. Now suppose we. first run K-means on the image data, and then instead of transmitting the original. pixel intensity vectors we transmit the identity of the nearest vector µk. Because. there are K such vectors, this requires log2 K bits per pixel. We must also transmit. the K code book vectors µk, which requires 24K bits, and so the total number of. bits required to transmit the image is 24K + N log2 K (rounding up to the nearest. integer). The original image shown in Figure 9.3 has 240 × 180 = 43, 200 pixels. and so requires 24 × 43, 200 = 1, 036, 800 bits to transmit directly. By comparison,. the compressed images require 43, 248 bits (K = 2), 86, 472 bits (K = 3), and. 173, 040 bits (K = 10), respectively, to transmit. These represent compression ratios. compared to the original image of 4.2%, 8.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. We see that. there is a trade-off between degree of compression and image quality. Note that our. aim in this example is to illustrate the K-means algorithm. If we had been aiming to. produce a good image compressor, then it would be more fruitful to consider small. blocks of adjacent pixels, for instance 5× 5, and thereby exploit the correlations that. exist in natural images between nearby pixels.. "
168,9.2,Mixtures of Gaussians,"In Section 2.3.9 we motivated the Gaussian mixture model as a simple linear super-. position of Gaussian components, aimed at providing a richer class of density mod-. els than the single Gaussian. We now turn to a formulation of Gaussian mixtures in. terms of discrete latent variables. This will provide us with a deeper insight into this. important distribution, and will also serve to motivate the expectation-maximization. algorithm.. Recall from (2.188) that the Gaussian mixture distribution can be written as a. linear superposition of Gaussians in the form. p(x) =. πkN (x|µk, Σk).. k=1. (9.7). Let us introduce a K-dimensional binary random variable z having a 1-of-K repre-. sentation in which a particular element zk is equal to 1 and all other elements are. equal to 0. The values of zk therefore satisfy zk ∈ {0, 1} and. k zk = 1, and we. see that there are K possible states for the vector z according to which element is. nonzero. We shall define the joint distribution p(x, z) in terms of a marginal dis-. tribution p(z) and a conditional distribution p(x|z), corresponding to the graphical. model in Figure 9.4. The marginal distribution over z is specified in terms of the. mixing coefficients πk, such that. p(zk = 1) = πk. k=1. K. K. k=1. K. K. k=1.

(9.9). where the parameters {πk} must satisfy. together with. 0 � πk � 1. πk = 1. in order to be valid probabilities. Because z uses a 1-of-K representation, we can. also write this distribution in the form. p(z) =. πzk. k .. (9.10). Similarly, the conditional distribution of x given a particular value for z is a Gaussian. which can also be written in the form. p(x|zk = 1) = N (x|µk, Σk). p(x|z) =. N (x|µk, Σk)zk .. (9.11). Exercise 9.3. The joint distribution is given by p(z)p(x|z), and the marginal distribution of x is. then obtained by summing the joint distribution over all possible states of z to give. p(x) =. p(z)p(x|z) =. z. k=1. πkN (x|µk, Σk). (9.12). where we have made use of (9.10) and (9.11). Thus the marginal distribution of x is. a Gaussian mixture of the form (9.7). If we have several observations x1, . . . , xN ,. then, because we have represented the marginal distribution in the form p(x) =. z p(x, z), it follows that for every observed data point xn there is a corresponding. latent variable zn.. We have therefore found an equivalent formulation of the Gaussian mixture in-. volving an explicit latent variable.. It might seem that we have not gained much. by doing so. However, we are now able to work with the joint distribution p(x, z). j=1. K. K. j=1. 432. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. instead of the marginal distribution p(x), and this will lead to significant simplifica-. tions, most notably through the introduction of the expectation-maximization (EM). algorithm.. Another quantity that will play an important role is the conditional probability. of z given x. We shall use γ(zk) to denote p(zk = 1|x), whose value can be found. using Bayes’ theorem. γ(zk) ≡ p(zk = 1|x) =. p(zk = 1)p(x|zk = 1). p(zj = 1)p(x|zj = 1). πkN (x|µk, Σk). πjN (x|µj, Σj). (9.13). Section 8.1.2. We shall view πk as the prior probability of zk = 1, and the quantity γ(zk) as the. corresponding posterior probability once we have observed x. As we shall see later,. γ(zk) can also be viewed as the responsibility that component k takes for ‘explain-. ing’ the observation x.. We can use the technique of ancestral sampling to generate random samples. distributed according to the Gaussian mixture model. To do this, we first generate a. z, from the marginal distribution p(z) and then generate. value for z, which we denote. a value for x from the conditional distribution p(x|. z). Techniques for sampling from. standard distributions are discussed in Chapter 11. We can depict samples from the. joint distribution p(x, z) by plotting points at the corresponding values of x and. then colouring them according to the value of z, in other words according to which. Gaussian component was responsible for generating them, as shown in Figure 9.5(a).. Similarly samples from the marginal distribution p(x) are obtained by taking the. samples from the joint distribution and ignoring the values of z. These are illustrated. in Figure 9.5(b) by plotting the x values without any coloured labels.. We can also use this synthetic data set to illustrate the ‘responsibilities’ by eval-. uating, for every data point, the posterior probability for each component in the. mixture distribution from which this data set was generated. In particular, we can. represent the value of the responsibilities γ(znk) associated with data point xn by. plotting the corresponding point using proportions of red, blue, and green ink given. by γ(znk) for k = 1, 2, 3, respectively, as shown in Figure 9.5(c). So, for instance,. a data point for which γ(zn1) = 1 will be coloured red, whereas one for which. γ(zn2) = γ(zn3) = 0.5 will be coloured with equal proportions of blue and green. ink and so will appear cyan. This should be compared with Figure 9.5(a) in which. the data points were labelled using the true identity of the component from which. they were generated.. "

Similarly, the corresponding latent. variables will be denoted by an N × K matrix Z with rows zT. n. If we assume that. the data points are drawn independently from the distribution, then we can express. the Gaussian mixture model for this i.i.d. data set using the graphical representation. shown in Figure 9.6. From (9.7) the log of the likelihood function is given by. ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) =. ln. n=1. k=1. πkN (xn|µk, Σk). (9.14). Before discussing how to maximize this function, it is worth emphasizing that. there is a significant problem associated with the maximum likelihood framework. applied to Gaussian mixture models, due to the presence of singularities. For sim-. plicity, consider a Gaussian mixture whose components have covariance matrices. given by Σk = σ2. kI, where I is the unit matrix, although the conclusions will hold. for general covariance matrices. Suppose that one of the components of the mixture. model, let us say the jth component, has its mean µj exactly equal to one of the data.

This data point will then contribute a. term in the likelihood function of the form. N (xn|xn, σ2. j I) =. 1. (2π)1/2. 1. σj. (9.15). If we consider the limit σj → 0, then we see that this term goes to infinity and. so the log likelihood function will also go to infinity. Thus the maximization of. the log likelihood function is not a well posed problem because such singularities. will always be present and will occur whenever one of the Gaussian components. ‘collapses’ onto a specific data point. Recall that this problem did not arise in the. case of a single Gaussian distribution. To understand the difference, note that if a. single Gaussian collapses onto a data point it will contribute multiplicative factors. to the likelihood function arising from the other data points and these factors will go. to zero exponentially fast, giving an overall likelihood that goes to zero rather than. infinity. However, once we have (at least) two components in the mixture, one of. the components can have a finite variance and therefore assign finite probability to. all of the data points while the other component can shrink onto one specific data. point and thereby contribute an ever increasing additive value to the log likelihood.. This is illustrated in Figure 9.7. These singularities provide another example of the. severe over-fitting that can occur in a maximum likelihood approach. We shall see. that this difficulty does not occur if we adopt a Bayesian approach. For the moment,. however, we simply note that in applying maximum likelihood to Gaussian mixture. models we must take steps to avoid finding such pathological solutions and instead. seek local maxima of the likelihood function that are well behaved. We can hope to. avoid the singularities by using suitable heuristics, for instance by detecting when a. Gaussian component is collapsing and resetting its mean to a randomly chosen value. while also resetting its covariance to some large value, and then continuing with the. optimization.. A further issue in finding maximum likelihood solutions arises from the fact. that for any given maximum likelihood solution, a K-component mixture will have. a total of K! equivalent solutions corresponding to the K! ways of assigning K. sets of parameters to K components. In other words, for any given (nondegenerate). point in the space of parameter values there will be a further K!−1 additional points. all of which give rise to exactly the same distribution. This problem is known as. Section 10.1. N. n=1. N. N. 9.2. Mixtures of Gaussians. 435. identifiability (Casella and Berger, 2002) and is an important issue when we wish to. interpret the parameter values discovered by a model. Identifiability will also arise. when we discuss models having continuous latent variables in Chapter 12. However,. for the purposes of finding a good density model, it is irrelevant because any of the. equivalent solutions is as good as any other.. Maximizing the log likelihood function (9.14) for a Gaussian mixture model. turns out to be a more complex problem than for the case of a single Gaussian. The. difficulty arises from the presence of the summation over k that appears inside the. logarithm in (9.14), so that the logarithm function no longer acts directly on the. Gaussian. If we set the derivatives of the log likelihood to zero, we will no longer. obtain a closed form solution, as we shall see shortly.. One approach is to apply gradient-based optimization techniques (Fletcher, 1987;. Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Although gradient-based. techniques are feasible, and indeed will play an important role when we discuss. mixture density networks in Chapter 5, we now consider an alternative approach. known as the EM algorithm which has broad applicability and which will lay the. foundations for a discussion of variational inference techniques in Chapter 10.. "
170,9.2.2,EM for Gaussian mixtures,"An elegant and powerful method for finding maximum likelihood solutions for. models with latent variables is called the expectation-maximization algorithm, or EM. algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997). Later we shall. give a general treatment of EM, and we shall also show how EM can be generalized. to obtain the variational inference framework. Initially, we shall motivate the EM. algorithm by giving a relatively informal treatment in the context of the Gaussian. mixture model. We emphasize, however, that EM has broad applicability, and indeed. it will be encountered in the context of a variety of different models in this book.. Let us begin by writing down the conditions that must be satisfied at a maximum. of the likelihood function. Setting the derivatives of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) in (9.14) with. respect to the means µk of the Gaussian components to zero, we obtain. 0 = −. n=1. πkN (xn|µk, Σk). j πjN (xn|µj, Σj). γ(znk). Σk(xn − µk). (9.16). where we have made use of the form (2.43) for the Gaussian distribution. Note that. the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, given by (9.13) appear naturally on. the right-hand side. Multiplying by Σ−1. (which we assume to be nonsingular) and. k. rearranging we obtain. µk =. where we have defined. 1. Nk. γ(znk)xn. Nk =. γ(znk).. n=1. (9.17). (9.18). Section 10.1. n=1. N. N. n=1. K. 436. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. We can interpret Nk as the effective number of points assigned to cluster k. Note. carefully the form of this solution. We see that the mean µk for the kth Gaussian. component is obtained by taking a weighted mean of all of the points in the data set,. in which the weighting factor for data point xn is given by the posterior probability. γ(znk) that component k was responsible for generating xn.. If we set the derivative of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to Σk to zero, and follow. a similar line of reasoning, making use of the result for the maximum likelihood. solution for the covariance matrix of a single Gaussian, we obtain. Σk =. 1. Nk. γ(znk)(xn − µk)(xn − µk)T. (9.19). which has the same form as the corresponding result for a single Gaussian fitted to. the data set, but again with each data point weighted by the corresponding poste-. rior probability and with the denominator given by the effective number of points. associated with the corresponding component.. Finally, we maximize ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to the mixing coefficients. πk. Here we must take account of the constraint (9.9), which requires the mixing. coefficients to sum to one. This can be achieved using a Lagrange multiplier and. maximizing the following quantity. Section 2.3.4. Appendix E. ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) + λ. πk − 1. k=1. which gives. 0 =. N (xn|µk, Σk). j πjN (xn|µj, Σj). (9.20). (9.21). where again we see the appearance of the responsibilities. If we now multiply both. sides by πk and sum over k making use of the constraint (9.9), we find λ = −N.. Using this to eliminate λ and rearranging we obtain. πk = Nk. N. (9.22). so that the mixing coefficient for the kth component is given by the average respon-. sibility which that component takes for explaining the data points.. It is worth emphasizing that the results (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) do not con-. stitute a closed-form solution for the parameters of the mixture model because the. responsibilities γ(znk) depend on those parameters in a complex way through (9.13).. However, these results do suggest a simple iterative scheme for finding a solution to. the maximum likelihood problem, which as we shall see turns out to be an instance. of the EM algorithm for the particular case of the Gaussian mixture model. We. first choose some initial values for the means, covariances, and mixing coefficients.. Then we alternate between the following two updates that we shall call the E step. 9.2.

Section 9.4. and the M step, for reasons that will become apparent shortly. In the expectation. step, or E step, we use the current values for the parameters to evaluate the posterior. probabilities, or responsibilities, given by (9.13). We then use these probabilities in. the maximization step, or M step, to re-estimate the means, covariances, and mix-. ing coefficients using the results (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22). Note that in so doing. we first evaluate the new means using (9.17) and then use these new values to find. the covariances using (9.19), in keeping with the corresponding result for a single. Gaussian distribution. We shall show that each update to the parameters resulting. from an E step followed by an M step is guaranteed to increase the log likelihood. function. In practice, the algorithm is deemed to have converged when the change. in the log likelihood function, or alternatively in the parameters, falls below some. threshold. We illustrate the EM algorithm for a mixture of two Gaussians applied to. the rescaled Old Faithful data set in Figure 9.8. Here a mixture of two Gaussians. is used, with centres initialized using the same values as for the K-means algorithm. in Figure 9.1, and with precision matrices initialized to be proportional to the unit. matrix.

Plot (b) shows the result. of the initial E step, in which each data point is depicted using a proportion of blue. ink equal to the posterior probability of having been generated from the blue com-. ponent, and a corresponding proportion of red ink given by the posterior probability. of having been generated by the red component. Thus, points that have a significant. probability for belonging to either cluster appear purple. The situation after the first. M step is shown in plot (c), in which the mean of the blue Gaussian has moved to. the mean of the data set, weighted by the probabilities of each data point belonging. to the blue cluster, in other words it has moved to the centre of mass of the blue ink.. Similarly, the covariance of the blue Gaussian is set equal to the covariance of the. blue ink. Analogous results hold for the red component. Plots (d), (e), and (f) show. the results after 2, 5, and 20 complete cycles of EM, respectively. In plot (f) the. algorithm is close to convergence.. Note that the EM algorithm takes many more iterations to reach (approximate). convergence compared with the K-means algorithm, and that each cycle requires. significantly more computation. It is therefore common to run the K-means algo-. rithm in order to find a suitable initialization for a Gaussian mixture model that is. subsequently adapted using EM. The covariance matrices can conveniently be ini-. tialized to the sample covariances of the clusters found by the K-means algorithm,. and the mixing coefficients can be set to the fractions of data points assigned to the. respective clusters. As with gradient-based approaches for maximizing the log like-. lihood, techniques must be employed to avoid singularities of the likelihood function. in which a Gaussian component collapses onto a particular data point. It should be. emphasized that there will generally be multiple local maxima of the log likelihood. function, and that EM is not guaranteed to find the largest of these maxima. Because. the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures plays such an important role, we summarize. it below.. EM for Gaussian Mixtures. Given a Gaussian mixture model, the goal is to maximize the likelihood function. with respect to the parameters (comprising the means and covariances of the. components and the mixing coefficients).. 1.

If. the convergence criterion is not satisfied return to step 2.. 9.3. An Alternative View of EM. In this section, we present a complementary view of the EM algorithm that recog-. nizes the key role played by latent variables. We discuss this approach first of all. in an abstract setting, and then for illustration we consider once again the case of. Gaussian mixtures.. The goal of the EM algorithm is to find maximum likelihood solutions for mod-. els having latent variables. We denote the set of all observed data by X, in which the. n, and similarly we denote the set of all latent variables by Z,. nth row represents xT. with a corresponding row zT. n. The set of all model parameters is denoted by θ, and. so the log likelihood function is given by. ln p(X|θ) = ln. p(X, Z|θ). Z. (9.29). Note that our discussion will apply equally well to continuous latent variables simply. by replacing the sum over Z with an integral.. A key observation is that the summation over the latent variables appears inside. the logarithm. Even if the joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) belongs to the exponential. Z. 440. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. family, the marginal distribution p(X|θ) typically does not as a result of this sum-. mation. The presence of the sum prevents the logarithm from acting directly on the. joint distribution, resulting in complicated expressions for the maximum likelihood. solution.. Now suppose that, for each observation in X, we were told the corresponding. value of the latent variable Z. We shall call {X, Z} the complete data set, and we. shall refer to the actual observed data X as incomplete, as illustrated in Figure 9.5.. The likelihood function for the complete data set simply takes the form ln p(X, Z|θ),. and we shall suppose that maximization of this complete-data log likelihood function. is straightforward.. In practice, however, we are not given the complete data set {X, Z}, but only. the incomplete data X. Our state of knowledge of the values of the latent variables. in Z is given only by the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θ). Because we cannot use. the complete-data log likelihood, we consider instead its expected value under the. posterior distribution of the latent variable, which corresponds (as we shall see) to the. E step of the EM algorithm. In the subsequent M step, we maximize this expectation.. If the current estimate for the parameters is denoted θold, then a pair of successive. E and M steps gives rise to a revised estimate θnew. The algorithm is initialized by. choosing some starting value for the parameters θ0. The use of the expectation may. seem somewhat arbitrary. However, we shall see the motivation for this choice when. we give a deeper treatment of EM in Section 9.4.. In the E step, we use the current parameter values θold to find the posterior. distribution of the latent variables given by p(Z|X, θold). We then use this posterior. distribution to find the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood evaluated for. some general parameter value θ. This expectation, denoted Q(θ, θold), is given by. (9.30). Q(θ, θold) =. p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ).. In the M step, we determine the revised parameter estimate θnew by maximizing this. function. θnew = arg max. Q(θ, θold).. (9.31). Section 9.4. Note that in the definition of Q(θ, θold), the logarithm acts directly on the joint. distribution p(X, Z|θ), and so the corresponding M-step maximization will, by sup-. position, be tractable.. The general EM algorithm is summarized below. It has the property, as we shall. show later, that each cycle of EM will increase the incomplete-data log likelihood. (unless it is already at a local maximum).. The General EM Algorithm. Given a joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) over observed variables X and latent vari-. ables Z, governed by parameters θ, the goal is to maximize the likelihood func-. tion p(X|θ) with respect to θ.. 1. Choose an initial setting for the parameters θold.. 9.3. An Alternative View of EM. 441. (9.32). (9.33). 2. E step Evaluate p(Z|X, θold).. 3. M step Evaluate θnew given by. θnew = arg max.

If the convergence criterion is not satisfied, then let. θold ← θnew. (9.34). and return to step 2.. The EM algorithm can also be used to find MAP (maximum posterior) solutions. for models in which a prior p(θ) is defined over the parameters. In this case the E. step remains the same as in the maximum likelihood case, whereas in the M step the. quantity to be maximized is given by Q(θ, θold) + ln p(θ). Suitable choices for the. prior will remove the singularities of the kind illustrated in Figure 9.7.. Here we have considered the use of the EM algorithm to maximize a likelihood. function when there are discrete latent variables. However, it can also be applied. when the unobserved variables correspond to missing values in the data set. The. distribution of the observed values is obtained by taking the joint distribution of all. the variables and then marginalizing over the missing ones. EM can then be used. to maximize the corresponding likelihood function. We shall show an example of. the application of this technique in the context of principal component analysis in. Figure 12.11. This will be a valid procedure if the data values are missing at random,. meaning that the mechanism causing values to be missing does not depend on the. unobserved values. In many situations this will not be the case, for instance if a. sensor fails to return a value whenever the quantity it is measuring exceeds some. threshold.. "
172,9.3.1,Gaussian mixtures revisited,"We now consider the application of this latent variable view of EM to the spe-. cific case of a Gaussian mixture model. Recall that our goal is to maximize the log. likelihood function (9.14), which is computed using the observed data set X, and we. saw that this was more difficult than for the case of a single Gaussian distribution. due to the presence of the summation over k that occurs inside the logarithm. Sup-. pose then that in addition to the observed data set X, we were also given the values. of the corresponding discrete variables Z. Recall that Figure 9.5(a) shows a ‘com-. plete’ data set (i.e., one that includes labels showing which component generated. each data point) while Figure 9.5(b) shows the corresponding ‘incomplete’ data set.. The graphical model for the complete data is shown in Figure 9.9.. N. K. N. K. N. (9.35). (9.36). Now consider the problem of maximizing the likelihood for the complete data. set {X, Z}. From (9.10) and (9.11), this likelihood function takes the form. p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π) =. πznk. k N (xn|µk, Σk)znk. n=1. k=1. where znk denotes the kth component of zn. Taking the logarithm, we obtain. ln p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π) =. n=1. k=1. znk {ln πk + lnN (xn|µk, Σk)} .. Comparison with the log likelihood function (9.14) for the incomplete data shows. that the summation over k and the logarithm have been interchanged. The loga-. rithm now acts directly on the Gaussian distribution, which itself is a member of. the exponential family. Not surprisingly, this leads to a much simpler solution to. the maximum likelihood problem, as we now show. Consider first the maximization. with respect to the means and covariances. Because zn is a K-dimensional vec-. tor with all elements equal to 0 except for a single element having the value 1, the. complete-data log likelihood function is simply a sum of K independent contribu-. tions, one for each mixture component. Thus the maximization with respect to a. mean or a covariance is exactly as for a single Gaussian, except that it involves only. the subset of data points that are ‘assigned’ to that component. For the maximization. with respect to the mixing coefficients, we note that these are coupled for different. values of k by virtue of the summation constraint (9.9). Again, this can be enforced. using a Lagrange multiplier as before, and leads to the result. πk =. 1. N. znk. n=1. (9.37). so that the mixing coefficients are equal to the fractions of data points assigned to. the corresponding components.. Thus we see that the complete-data log likelihood function can be maximized. trivially in closed form. In practice, however, we do not have values for the latent. variables so, as discussed earlier, we consider the expectation, with respect to the. posterior distribution of the latent variables, of the complete-data log likelihood.. 442. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. Figure 9.9 This shows the same graph as in Figure 9.6 except that. we now suppose that the discrete variables zn are ob-. served, as well as the data variables xn.. zn. xn. N. K. n=1. j=1. znk. znj. N. N. K. 9.3. An Alternative View of EM. 443. Using (9.10) and (9.11) together with Bayes’ theorem, we see that this posterior. distribution takes the form. p(Z|X, µ, Σ, π) ∝. [πkN (xn|µk, Σk)]znk .. k=1. (9.38). and hence factorizes over n so that under the posterior distribution the {zn} are. independent. This is easily verified by inspection of the directed graph in Figure 9.6. and making use of the d-separation criterion. The expected value of the indicator. variable znk under this posterior distribution is then given by. E[znk] =. znk [πkN (xn|µk, Σk)]znk. πjN (xn|µj, Σj). znj. K. πkN (xn|µk, Σk). πjN (xn|µj, Σj). = γ(znk). (9.39). which is just the responsibility of component k for data point xn. The expected value. of the complete-data log likelihood function is therefore given by. EZ[ln p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π)] =. n=1. k=1. γ(znk){ln πk + lnN (xn|µk, Σk)} .. (9.40). We can now proceed as follows. First we choose some initial values for the param-. eters µold, Σold and πold, and use these to evaluate the responsibilities (the E step).. We then keep the responsibilities fixed and maximize (9.40) with respect to µk, Σk. and πk (the M step). This leads to closed form solutions for µnew, Σnew and πnew. given by (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) as before. This is precisely the EM algorithm for. Gaussian mixtures as derived earlier. We shall gain more insight into the role of the. expected complete-data log likelihood function when we give a proof of convergence. of the EM algorithm in Section 9.4.. "
173,9.3.2,Relation to K-means,"Comparison of the K-means algorithm with the EM algorithm for Gaussian. mixtures shows that there is a close similarity. Whereas the K-means algorithm. performs a hard assignment of data points to clusters, in which each data point is. associated uniquely with one cluster, the EM algorithm makes a soft assignment. based on the posterior probabilities. In fact, we can derive the K-means algorithm. as a particular limit of EM for Gaussian mixtures as follows.. Consider a Gaussian mixture model in which the covariance matrices of the. mixture components are given by 	I, where 	 is a variance parameter that is shared. Exercise 9.5. Section 8.2. Exercise 9.8. (9.41). K. N. 444. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. by all of the components, and I is the identity matrix, so that. p(x|µk, Σk) =. (2π	)1/2. 1. exp. 1. 2	x − µk2. We now consider the EM algorithm for a mixture of K Gaussians of this form in. which we treat 	 as a fixed constant, instead of a parameter to be re-estimated. From. (9.13) the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, for a particular data point xn,. are given by. γ(znk) = πk exp{−xn − µk2/2	}. −xn − µj2/2. j πj exp. (9.42). If we consider the limit 	 → 0, we see that in the denominator the term for which. xn − µj2 is smallest will go to zero most slowly, and hence the responsibilities. γ(znk) for the data point xn all go to zero except for term j, for which the responsi-. bility γ(znj) will go to unity. Note that this holds independently of the values of the. πk so long as none of the πk is zero. Thus, in this limit, we obtain a hard assignment. of data points to clusters, just as in the K-means algorithm, so that γ(znk) → rnk. where rnk is defined by (9.2). Each data point is thereby assigned to the cluster. having the closest mean.. The EM re-estimation equation for the µk, given by (9.17), then reduces to the. K-means result (9.4). Note that the re-estimation formula for the mixing coefficients. (9.22) simply re-sets the value of πk to be equal to the fraction of data points assigned. to cluster k, although these parameters no longer play an active role in the algorithm.. Finally, in the limit 	 → 0 the expected complete-data log likelihood, given by. (9.40), becomes. EZ[ln p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π)] → −. 1. 2. rnkxn − µk2 + const.. (9.43). n=1. k=1. Thus we see that in this limit, maximizing the expected complete-data log likelihood. is equivalent to minimizing the distortion measure J for the K-means algorithm. given by (9.1).. Note that the K-means algorithm does not estimate the covariances of the clus-. ters but only the cluster means. A hard-assignment version of the Gaussian mixture. model with general covariance matrices, known as the elliptical K-means algorithm,. has been considered by Sung and Poggio (1994).. "
174,9.3.3,Mixtures of Bernoulli distributions,"So far in this chapter, we have focussed on distributions over continuous vari-. ables described by mixtures of Gaussians. As a further example of mixture mod-. elling, and to illustrate the EM algorithm in a different context, we now discuss mix-. tures of discrete binary variables described by Bernoulli distributions. This model. is also known as latent class analysis (Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968; McLachlan and. Peel, 2000). As well as being of practical importance in its own right, our discus-. sion of Bernoulli mixtures will also lay the foundation for a consideration of hidden. Markov models over discrete variables..

Consider a set of D binary variables xi, where i = 1, . . . , D, each of which is. governed by a Bernoulli distribution with parameter µi, so that. where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T and µ = (µ1, . . . , µD)T. We see that the individual. variables xi are independent, given µ. The mean and covariance of this distribution. are easily seen to be. Now let us consider a finite mixture of these distributions given by. p(x|µ) =. µxi. i (1 − µi)(1−xi). E[x] = µ. cov[x] = diag{µi(1 − µi)}.. p(x|µ, π) =. πkp(x|µk). where µ = {µ1, . . . , µK}, π = {π1, . . . , πK}, and. p(x|µk) =. µxi. ki(1 − µki)(1−xi).. Exercise 9.12. The mean and covariance of this mixture distribution are given by. E[x] =. πkµk. cov[x] =. k=1. πk. Σk + µkµT. k. − E[x]E[x]T. where Σk = diag {µki(1 − µki)}. Because the covariance matrix cov[x] is no. longer diagonal, the mixture distribution can capture correlations between the vari-. ables, unlike a single Bernoulli distribution.. If we are given a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN} then the log likelihood function. for this model is given by. ln p(X|µ, π) =. ln. n=1. k=1. πkp(xn|µk). (9.51). Again we see the appearance of the summation inside the logarithm, so that the. maximum likelihood solution no longer has closed form.. We now derive the EM algorithm for maximizing the likelihood function for. the mixture of Bernoulli distributions. To do this, we first introduce an explicit latent. N. znk. n=1. k=1. k=1. k=1. znk. znj. N. K. K. K. K. i=1. D. D. 446. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. variable z associated with each instance of x. As in the case of the Gaussian mixture,. z = (z1, . . . , zK)T is a binary K-dimensional variable having a single component. equal to 1, with all other components equal to 0. We can then write the conditional. distribution of x, given the latent variable, as. while the prior distribution for the latent variables is the same as for the mixture of. Gaussians model, so that. p(x|z, µ) =. p(x|µk)zk. p(z|π) =. πzk. k .. (9.52). (9.53). Exercise 9.14. If we form the product of p(x|z, µ) and p(z|π) and then marginalize over z, then we. recover (9.47).. In order to derive the EM algorithm, we first write down the complete-data log. likelihood function, which is given by. ln p(X, Z|µ, π) =. n=1. k=1. ln πk. [xni ln µki + (1 − xni) ln(1 − µki)]. (9.54). where X = {xn} and Z = {zn}. Next we take the expectation of the complete-data. log likelihood with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent variables to give. EZ[ln p(X, Z|µ, π)] =. γ(znk). ln πk. i=1. [xni ln µki + (1 − xni) ln(1 − µki)]. (9.55). where γ(znk) = E[znk] is the posterior probability, or responsibility, of component. k given data point xn. In the E step, these responsibilities are evaluated using Bayes’. theorem, which takes the form. γ(znk) = E[znk] =. znk [πkp(xn|µk)]znk. πjp(xn|µj). znj. K. πkp(xn|µk). πjp(xn|µj). j=1. (9.56). N. N. n=1. 9.3. An Alternative View of EM. 447. If we consider the sum over n in (9.55), we see that the responsibilities enter. only through two terms, which can be written as. γ(znk). Nk =. xk =. n=1. 1. Nk. γ(znk)xn. (9.57). (9.58). where Nk is the effective number of data points associated with component k. In the. M step, we maximize the expected complete-data log likelihood with respect to the. parameters µk and π. If we set the derivative of (9.55) with respect to µk equal to. zero and rearrange the terms, we obtain. µk = xk.. (9.59). We see that this sets the mean of component k equal to a weighted mean of the. data, with weighting coefficients given by the responsibilities that component k takes. for data points. For the maximization with respect to πk, we need to introduce a. k πk = 1. Following analogous. Lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint. steps to those used for the mixture of Gaussians, we then obtain. πk = Nk. N. (9.60). which represents the intuitively reasonable result that the mixing coefficient for com-. ponent k is given by the effective fraction of points in the data set explained by that. component.. Note that in contrast to the mixture of Gaussians, there are no singularities in. which the likelihood function goes to infinity. This can be seen by noting that the. likelihood function is bounded above because 0 � p(xn|µk) � 1. There exist. singularities at which the likelihood function goes to zero, but these will not be. found by EM provided it is not initialized to a pathological starting point, because. the EM algorithm always increases the value of the likelihood function, until a local. maximum is found. We illustrate the Bernoulli mixture model in Figure 9.10 by. using it to model handwritten digits. Here the digit images have been turned into. binary vectors by setting all elements whose values exceed 0.5 to 1 and setting the. remaining elements to 0. We now fit a data set of N = 600 such digits, comprising. the digits ‘2’, ‘3’, and ‘4’, with a mixture of K = 3 Bernoulli distributions by. running 10 iterations of the EM algorithm. The mixing coefficients were initialized. to πk = 1/K, and the parameters µkj were set to random values chosen uniformly in. j µkj = 1.. the range (0.25, 0.75) and then normalized to satisfy the constraint that. We see that a mixture of 3 Bernoulli distributions is able to find the three clusters in. the data set corresponding to the different digits.. The conjugate prior for the parameters of a Bernoulli distribution is given by. the beta distribution, and we have seen that a beta prior is equivalent to introducing. Exercise 9.15. Exercise 9.16. Exercise 9.17. Section 9.4. 448. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM.

As a comparison,. we also fit the same data set using a single multivariate Bernoulli distribution, again using maximum likelihood.. This amounts to simply averaging the counts in each pixel and is shown by the right-most image on the bottom. row.. Section 2.1.1. Exercise 9.18. Exercise 9.19. additional effective observations of x. We can similarly introduce priors into the. Bernoulli mixture model, and use EM to maximize the posterior probability distri-. butions.. It is straightforward to extend the analysis of Bernoulli mixtures to the case of. multinomial binary variables having M > 2 states by making use of the discrete dis-. tribution (2.26). Again, we can introduce Dirichlet priors over the model parameters. if desired.. "
175,9.3.4,EM for Bayesian linear regression,"As a third example of the application of EM, we return to the evidence ap-. proximation for Bayesian linear regression. In Section 3.5.2, we obtained the re-. estimation equations for the hyperparameters α and β by evaluation of the evidence. and then setting the derivatives of the resulting expression to zero. We now turn to. an alternative approach for finding α and β based on the EM algorithm. Recall that. our goal is to maximize the evidence function p(t|α, β) given by (3.77) with respect. to α and β. Because the parameter vector w is marginalized out, we can regard it as. a latent variable, and hence we can optimize this marginal likelihood function using. EM. In the E step, we compute the posterior distribution of w given the current set-. ting of the parameters α and β and then use this to find the expected complete-data. log likelihood. In the M step, we maximize this quantity with respect to α and β. We. have already derived the posterior distribution of w because this is given by (3.49).. The complete-data log likelihood function is then given by. ln p(t, w|α, β) = ln p(t|w, β) + ln p(w|α). (9.61). N. 2. M. 9.3.

Setting the derivatives with respect to α to zero, we obtain the M step re-estimation. equation. α = M. E [wTw]. M. N mN + Tr(SN ) .. mT. (9.63). An analogous result holds for β.. Note that this re-estimation equation takes a slightly different form from the. corresponding result (3.92) derived by direct evaluation of the evidence function.. However, they each involve computation and inversion (or eigen decomposition) of. an M × M matrix and hence will have comparable computational cost per iteration.. These two approaches to determining α should of course converge to the same. result (assuming they find the same local maximum of the evidence function). This. can be verified by first noting that the quantity γ is defined by. γ = M − α. = M − αTr(SN ).. (9.64). 1. λi + α. i=1. Exercise 9.20. Exercise 9.21. At a stationary point of the evidence function, the re-estimation equation (3.92) will. be self-consistently satisfied, and hence we can substitute for γ to give. αmT. N mN = γ = M − αTr(SN ). (9.65). and solving for α we obtain (9.63), which is precisely the EM re-estimation equation.. As a final example, we consider a closely related model, namely the relevance. vector machine for regression discussed in Section 7.2.1. There we used direct max-. imization of the marginal likelihood to derive re-estimation equations for the hyper-. parameters α and β. Here we consider an alternative approach in which we view the. weight vector w as a latent variable and apply the EM algorithm. The E step involves. finding the posterior distribution over the weights, and this is given by (7.81). In the. M step we maximize the expected complete-data log likelihood, which is defined by. Exercise 9.22. where the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior distribution computed. using the ‘old’ parameter values. To compute the new parameter values we maximize. with respect to α and β to give. Ew [ln p(t|X, w, β)p(w|α)]. (9.66). 1. m2. Z. Z. N. The expectation maximization algorithm, or EM algorithm, is a general technique for. finding maximum likelihood solutions for probabilistic models having latent vari-. ables (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997). Here we give a very. general treatment of the EM algorithm and in the process provide a proof that the. EM algorithm derived heuristically in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 for Gaussian mixtures. does indeed maximize the likelihood function (Csisz`ar and Tusn`ady, 1984; Hath-. away, 1986; Neal and Hinton, 1999). Our discussion will also form the basis for the. derivation of the variational inference framework.. Consider a probabilistic model in which we collectively denote all of the ob-. served variables by X and all of the hidden variables by Z. The joint distribution. p(X, Z|θ) is governed by a set of parameters denoted θ. Our goal is to maximize. the likelihood function that is given by. p(X|θ) =. p(X, Z|θ).. (9.69). Here we are assuming Z is discrete, although the discussion is identical if Z com-. prises continuous variables or a combination of discrete and continuous variables,. with summation replaced by integration as appropriate.. We shall suppose that direct optimization of p(X|θ) is difficult, but that opti-. mization of the complete-data likelihood function p(X, Z|θ) is significantly easier.. Next we introduce a distribution q(Z) defined over the latent variables, and we ob-. serve that, for any choice of q(Z), the following decomposition holds. ln p(X|θ) = L(q, θ) + KL(qp). where we have defined.

Figure 9.11 Illustration of the decomposition given. by (9.70), which holds for any choice. of distribution q(Z).. Because the. Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfies.

To verify the. decomposition (9.70), we first make use of the product rule of probability to give. ln p(X, Z|θ) = ln p(Z|X, θ) + ln p(X|θ). (9.73). which we then substitute into the expression for L(q, θ). This gives rise to two terms,. one of which cancels KL(qp) while the other gives the required log likelihood. ln p(X|θ) after noting that q(Z) is a normalized distribution that sums to 1.. From (9.72), we see that KL(qp) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between. q(Z) and the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θ). Recall that the Kullback-Leibler di-. vergence satisfies KL(qp) � 0, with equality if, and only if, q(Z) = p(Z|X, θ). It. therefore follows from (9.70) that L(q, θ) � ln p(X|θ), in other words that L(q, θ). is a lower bound on ln p(X|θ). The decomposition (9.70) is illustrated in Fig-. ure 9.11.. The EM algorithm is a two-stage iterative optimization technique for finding. maximum likelihood solutions. We can use the decomposition (9.70) to define the. EM algorithm and to demonstrate that it does indeed maximize the log likelihood.. Suppose that the current value of the parameter vector is θold. In the E step, the. lower bound L(q, θold) is maximized with respect to q(Z) while holding θold fixed.. The solution to this maximization problem is easily seen by noting that the value. of ln p(X|θold) does not depend on q(Z) and so the largest value of L(q, θold) will. occur when the Kullback-Leibler divergence vanishes, in other words when q(Z) is. equal to the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θold). In this case, the lower bound will. equal the log likelihood, as illustrated in Figure 9.12.. In the subsequent M step, the distribution q(Z) is held fixed and the lower bound. L(q, θ) is maximized with respect to θ to give some new value θnew. This will. cause the lower bound L to increase (unless it is already at a maximum), which will. necessarily cause the corresponding log likelihood function to increase. Because the. distribution q is determined using the old parameter values rather than the new values. and is held fixed during the M step, it will not equal the new posterior distribution. p(Z|X, θnew), and hence there will be a nonzero KL divergence. The increase in the. log likelihood function is therefore greater than the increase in the lower bound, as. 452. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. KL(q||p) = 0. Figure 9.12 Illustration of the E step of. the EM algorithm. The q. distribution is set equal to. the posterior distribution for. the current parameter val-. ues θold, causing the lower. bound to move up to the. same value as the log like-. lihood function, with the KL. divergence vanishing.. L(q, θold). ln p(X|θold). shown in Figure 9.13. If we substitute q(Z) = p(Z|X, θold) into (9.71), we see that,. after the E step, the lower bound takes the form. L(q, θ) =. Z. p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ) −. = Q(θ, θold) + const. Z. p(Z|X, θold) ln p(Z|X, θold). (9.74). where the constant is simply the negative entropy of the q distribution and is there-. fore independent of θ. Thus in the M step, the quantity that is being maximized is the. expectation of the complete-data log likelihood, as we saw earlier in the case of mix-. tures of Gaussians. Note that the variable θ over which we are optimizing appears. only inside the logarithm. If the joint distribution p(Z, X|θ) comprises a member of. the exponential family, or a product of such members, then we see that the logarithm. will cancel the exponential and lead to an M step that will be typically much simpler. than the maximization of the corresponding incomplete-data log likelihood function. p(X|θ).. The operation of the EM algorithm can also be viewed in the space of parame-. ters, as illustrated schematically in Figure 9.14. Here the red curve depicts the (in-.

L(q, θ) is maximized with respect. to the parameter vector θ to give. a revised value θnew. Because the.

We start. with some initial parameter value θold, and in the first E step we evaluate the poste-. rior distribution over latent variables, which gives rise to a lower bound L(θ, θ(old)). whose value equals the log likelihood at θ(old), as shown by the blue curve. Note that. the bound makes a tangential contact with the log likelihood at θ(old), so that both. curves have the same gradient. This bound is a convex function having a unique. maximum (for mixture components from the exponential family). In the M step, the. bound is maximized giving the value θ(new), which gives a larger value of log likeli-. hood than θ(old). The subsequent E step then constructs a bound that is tangential at. θ(new) as shown by the green curve.. For the particular case of an independent, identically distributed data set, X. will comprise N data points {xn} while Z will comprise N corresponding latent. variables {zn}, where n = 1, . . . , N. From the independence assumption, we have. n p(xn, zn) and, by marginalizing over the {zn} we have p(X) =. p(X, Z) =. n p(xn). Using the sum and product rules, we see that the posterior probability. that is evaluated in the E step takes the form. p(Z|X, θ) = p(X, Z|θ). p(X, Z|θ). n=1. p(zn|xn, θ).

We have seen that both the E and the M steps of the EM algorithm are increas-. ing the value of a well-defined bound on the log likelihood function and that the. n=1. N. N. N. 454. 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM. complete EM cycle will change the model parameters in such a way as to cause. the log likelihood to increase (unless it is already at a maximum, in which case the. parameters remain unchanged).. We can also use the EM algorithm to maximize the posterior distribution p(θ|X). for models in which we have introduced a prior p(θ) over the parameters. To see this,. we note that as a function of θ, we have p(θ|X) = p(θ, X)/p(X) and so. ln p(θ|X) = ln p(θ, X) − ln p(X).. Making use of the decomposition (9.70), we have. ln p(θ|X) = L(q, θ) + KL(qp) + ln p(θ) − ln p(X). � L(q, θ) + ln p(θ) − ln p(X).. (9.76). (9.77). where ln p(X) is a constant. We can again optimize the right-hand side alternately. with respect to q and θ. The optimization with respect to q gives rise to the same E-. step equations as for the standard EM algorithm, because q only appears in L(q, θ).. The M-step equations are modified through the introduction of the prior term ln p(θ),. which typically requires only a small modification to the standard maximum likeli-. hood M-step equations.. The EM algorithm breaks down the potentially difficult problem of maximizing. the likelihood function into two stages, the E step and the M step, each of which will. often prove simpler to implement. Nevertheless, for complex models it may be the. case that either the E step or the M step, or indeed both, remain intractable. This. leads to two possible extensions of the EM algorithm, as follows.. The generalized EM, or GEM, algorithm addresses the problem of an intractable. M step. Instead of aiming to maximize L(q, θ) with respect to θ, it seeks instead. to change the parameters in such a way as to increase its value. Again, because. L(q, θ) is a lower bound on the log likelihood function, each complete EM cycle of. the GEM algorithm is guaranteed to increase the value of the log likelihood (unless. the parameters already correspond to a local maximum). One way to exploit the. GEM approach would be to use one of the nonlinear optimization strategies, such. as the conjugate gradients algorithm, during the M step. Another form of GEM. algorithm, known as the expectation conditional maximization, or ECM, algorithm,. involves making several constrained optimizations within each M step (Meng and. Rubin, 1993). For instance, the parameters might be partitioned into groups, and the. M step is broken down into multiple steps each of which involves optimizing one of. the subset with the remainder held fixed.. We can similarly generalize the E step of the EM algorithm by performing a. partial, rather than complete, optimization of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) (Neal and. Hinton, 1999). As we have seen, for any given value of θ there is a unique maximum. of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) that corresponds to the posterior distribution qθ(Z) =. p(Z|X, θ) and that for this choice of q(Z) the bound L(q, θ) is equal to the log. likelihood function ln p(X|θ). It follows that any algorithm that converges to the. global maximum of L(q, θ) will find a value of θ that is also a global maximum. of the log likelihood ln p(X|θ). Provided p(X, Z|θ) is a continuous function of θ. Exercises. 455. then, by continuity, any local maximum of L(q, θ) will also be a local maximum of. ln p(X|θ).. Consider the case of N independent data points x1, . . . , xN with corresponding. latent variables z1, . . . , zN . The joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) factorizes over the data. points, and this structure can be exploited in an incremental form of EM in which. at each EM cycle only one data point is processed at a time. In the E step, instead. of recomputing the responsibilities for all of the data points, we just re-evaluate the. responsibilities for one data point. It might appear that the subsequent M step would. require computation involving the responsibilities for all of the data points. How-. ever, if the mixture components are members of the exponential family, then the. responsibilities enter only through simple sufficient statistics, and these can be up-. dated efficiently. Consider, for instance, the case of a Gaussian mixture, and suppose. we perform an update for data point m in which the corresponding old and new. values of the responsibilities are denoted γold(zmk) and γnew(zmk). In the M step,. the required sufficient statistics can be updated incrementally. For instance, for the. means the sufficient statistics are defined by (9.17) and (9.18) from which we obtain. (9.78).

The corresponding results for the covariances and the mixing coefficients are analo-. gous.. Thus both the E step and the M step take fixed time that is independent of the. total number of data points. Because the parameters are revised after each data point,. rather than waiting until after the whole data set is processed, this incremental ver-. sion can converge faster than the batch version. Each E or M step in this incremental. algorithm is increasing the value of L(q, θ) and, as we have shown above, if the. algorithm converges to a local (or global) maximum of L(q, θ), this will correspond. to a local (or global) maximum of the log likelihood function ln p(X|θ).. 9.1 () www Consider the K-means algorithm discussed in Section 9.1.

177,10,Approximate Inference,"A central task in the application of probabilistic models is the evaluation of the pos-. terior distribution p(Z|X) of the latent variables Z given the observed (visible) data. variables X, and the evaluation of expectations computed with respect to this dis-. tribution. The model might also contain some deterministic parameters, which we. will leave implicit for the moment, or it may be a fully Bayesian model in which any. unknown parameters are given prior distributions and are absorbed into the set of. latent variables denoted by the vector Z. For instance, in the EM algorithm we need. to evaluate the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood with respect to the. posterior distribution of the latent variables. For many models of practical interest, it. will be infeasible to evaluate the posterior distribution or indeed to compute expec-. tations with respect to this distribution. This could be because the dimensionality of. the latent space is too high to work with directly or because the posterior distribution. has a highly complex form for which expectations are not analytically tractable. In. the case of continuous variables, the required integrations may not have closed-form. 461. 462. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. analytical solutions, while the dimensionality of the space and the complexity of the. integrand may prohibit numerical integration. For discrete variables, the marginal-. izations involve summing over all possible configurations of the hidden variables,. and though this is always possible in principle, we often find in practice that there. may be exponentially many hidden states so that exact calculation is prohibitively. expensive.. In such situations, we need to resort to approximation schemes, and these fall. broadly into two classes, according to whether they rely on stochastic or determin-. istic approximations. Stochastic techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, de-. scribed in Chapter 11, have enabled the widespread use of Bayesian methods across. many domains. They generally have the property that given infinite computational. resource, they can generate exact results, and the approximation arises from the use. of a finite amount of processor time. In practice, sampling methods can be compu-. tationally demanding, often limiting their use to small-scale problems. Also, it can. be difficult to know whether a sampling scheme is generating independent samples. from the required distribution.. In this chapter, we introduce a range of deterministic approximation schemes,. some of which scale well to large applications. These are based on analytical ap-. proximations to the posterior distribution, for example by assuming that it factorizes. in a particular way or that it has a specific parametric form such as a Gaussian. As. such, they can never generate exact results, and so their strengths and weaknesses. are complementary to those of sampling methods.. In Section 4.4, we discussed the Laplace approximation, which is based on a. local Gaussian approximation to a mode (i.e., a maximum) of the distribution. Here. we turn to a family of approximation techniques called variational inference or vari-. ational Bayes, which use more global criteria and which have been widely applied.. We conclude with a brief introduction to an alternative variational framework known. as expectation propagation.. "
178,10.1,Variational Inference,"Variational methods have their origins in the 18th century with the work of Euler,. Lagrange, and others on the calculus of variations. Standard calculus is concerned. with finding derivatives of functions. We can think of a function as a mapping that. takes the value of a variable as the input and returns the value of the function as the. output. The derivative of the function then describes how the output value varies. as we make infinitesimal changes to the input value. Similarly, we can define a. functional as a mapping that takes a function as the input and that returns the value. of the functional as the output. An example would be the entropy H[p], which takes. a probability distribution p(x) as the input and returns the quantity. H[p] =. p(x) ln p(x) dx. (10.1). 10.1. Variational Inference. 463. as the output. We can the introduce the concept of a functional derivative, which ex-. presses how the value of the functional changes in response to infinitesimal changes. to the input function (Feynman et al., 1964). The rules for the calculus of variations. mirror those of standard calculus and are discussed in Appendix D. Many problems. can be expressed in terms of an optimization problem in which the quantity being. optimized is a functional. The solution is obtained by exploring all possible input. functions to find the one that maximizes, or minimizes, the functional. Variational. methods have broad applicability and include such areas as finite element methods. (Kapur, 1989) and maximum entropy (Schwarz, 1988).. Although there is nothing intrinsically approximate about variational methods,. they do naturally lend themselves to finding approximate solutions. This is done. by restricting the range of functions over which the optimization is performed, for. instance by considering only quadratic functions or by considering functions com-. posed of a linear combination of fixed basis functions in which only the coefficients. of the linear combination can vary. In the case of applications to probabilistic in-. ference, the restriction may for example take the form of factorization assumptions. (Jordan et al., 1999; Jaakkola, 2001).. Now let us consider in more detail how the concept of variational optimization. can be applied to the inference problem. Suppose we have a fully Bayesian model in. which all parameters are given prior distributions. The model may also have latent. variables as well as parameters, and we shall denote the set of all latent variables. and parameters by Z. Similarly, we denote the set of all observed variables by X.. For example, we might have a set of N independent, identically distributed data,. for which X = {x1, . . . , xN} and Z = {z1, . . . , zN}. Our probabilistic model. specifies the joint distribution p(X, Z), and our goal is to find an approximation for. the posterior distribution p(Z|X) as well as for the model evidence p(X). As in our. discussion of EM, we can decompose the log marginal probability using. where we have defined. ln p(X) = L(q) + KL(qp). L(q) =. q(Z) ln. KL(qp) = −. q(Z) ln. p(X, Z). q(Z). p(Z|X). q(Z). dZ. dZ.. (10.2). (10.3). (10.4). This differs from our discussion of EM only in that the parameter vector θ no longer. appears, because the parameters are now stochastic variables and are absorbed into. Z. Since in this chapter we will mainly be interested in continuous variables we have. used integrations rather than summations in formulating this decomposition. How-. ever, the analysis goes through unchanged if some or all of the variables are discrete. simply by replacing the integrations with summations as required. As before, we. can maximize the lower bound L(q) by optimization with respect to the distribution. q(Z), which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence. If we allow any possible. choice for q(Z), then the maximum of the lower bound occurs when the KL diver-. gence vanishes, which occurs when q(Z) equals the posterior distribution p(Z|X).. 464. 10.

Our goal. is to restrict the family sufficiently that they comprise only tractable distributions,. while at the same time allowing the family to be sufficiently rich and flexible that it. can provide a good approximation to the true posterior distribution. It is important to. emphasize that the restriction is imposed purely to achieve tractability, and that sub-. ject to this requirement we should use as rich a family of approximating distributions. as possible. In particular, there is no ‘over-fitting’ associated with highly flexible dis-. tributions. Using more flexible approximations simply allows us to approach the true. posterior distribution more closely.. One way to restrict the family of approximating distributions is to use a paramet-. ric distribution q(Z|ω) governed by a set of parameters ω. The lower bound L(q). then becomes a function of ω, and we can exploit standard nonlinear optimization. techniques to determine the optimal values for the parameters. An example of this. approach, in which the variational distribution is a Gaussian and we have optimized. with respect to its mean and variance, is shown in Figure 10.1.. "
179,10.1.1,Factorized distributions,"Here we consider an alternative way in which to restrict the family of distri-. butions q(Z). Suppose we partition the elements of Z into disjoint groups that we. denote by Zi where i = 1, . . . , M. We then assume that the q distribution factorizes. with respect to these groups, so that. q(Z) =. qi(Zi).. i=1. (10.5). qj. qi. i. i. i=j. 10.1. Variational Inference. 465. It should be emphasized that we are making no further assumptions about the distri-. bution. In particular, we place no restriction on the functional forms of the individual. factors qi(Zi). This factorized form of variational inference corresponds to an ap-. proximation framework developed in physics called mean field theory (Parisi, 1988).. Amongst all distributions q(Z) having the form (10.5), we now seek that distri-. bution for which the lower bound L(q) is largest. We therefore wish to make a free. form (variational) optimization of L(q) with respect to all of the distributions qi(Zi),. which we do by optimizing with respect to each of the factors in turn. To achieve. this, we first substitute (10.5) into (10.3) and then dissect out the dependence on one. of the factors qj(Zj). Denoting qj(Zj) by simply qj to keep the notation uncluttered,. we then obtain. L(q) =. ln p(X, Z) −. ln qi. dZ. ln p(X, Z). qi dZi. qj ln qj dZj + const. dZj −. i=j. p(X, Zj) dZj −. where we have defined a new distribution. qj ln. qj ln qj dZj + const.

Here the notation Ei=j[··· ] denotes an expectation with respect to the q distributions. over all variables zi for i = j, so that. Ei=j[ln p(X, Z)] =. ln p(X, Z). qi dZi.. (10.8). Now suppose we keep the {qi=j} fixed and maximize L(q) in (10.6) with re-. spect to all possible forms for the distribution qj(Zj). This is easily done by rec-. ognizing that (10.6) is a negative Kullback-Leibler divergence between qj(Zj) and. p(X, Zj). Thus maximizing (10.6) is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler.

Thus we obtain a. (10.9). It is worth taking a few moments to study the form of this solution as it provides the. basis for applications of variational methods. It says that the log of the optimal so-. lution for factor qj is obtained simply by considering the log of the joint distribution. over all hidden and visible variables and then taking the expectation with respect to. all of the other factors {qi} for i = j.. Thus if we take the exponential of both sides and normalize, we have. The additive constant in (10.9) is set by normalizing the distribution q. j (Zj).. j (Zj) =. q. exp (Ei=j[ln p(X, Z)]). exp (Ei=j[ln p(X, Z)]) dZj. In practice, we shall find it more convenient to work with the form (10.9) and then re-. instate the normalization constant (where required) by inspection. This will become. clear from subsequent examples.. The set of equations given by (10.9) for j = 1, . . . , M represent a set of con-. sistency conditions for the maximum of the lower bound subject to the factorization. constraint. However, they do not represent an explicit solution because the expres-. j (Zj) depends on expectations. sion on the right-hand side of (10.9) for the optimum q. computed with respect to the other factors qi(Zi) for i = j. We will therefore seek. a consistent solution by first initializing all of the factors qi(Zi) appropriately and. then cycling through the factors and replacing each in turn with a revised estimate. given by the right-hand side of (10.9) evaluated using the current estimates for all of. the other factors. Convergence is guaranteed because bound is convex with respect. to each of the factors qi(Zi) (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).. "
180,10.1.2,Properties of factorized approximations,"Our approach to variational inference is based on a factorized approximation to. the true posterior distribution. Let us consider for a moment the problem of approx-. imating a general distribution by a factorized distribution. To begin with, we discuss. the problem of approximating a Gaussian distribution using a factorized Gaussian,. which will provide useful insight into the types of inaccuracy introduced in using. factorized approximations. Consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) = N (z|µ, Λ−1). over two correlated variables z = (z1, z2) in which the mean and precision have. elements. µ1. µ2. Λ11 Λ12. Λ21 Λ22. (10.10). and Λ21 = Λ12 due to the symmetry of the precision matrix. Now suppose we. wish to approximate this distribution using a factorized Gaussian of the form q(z) =. q1(z1)q2(z2). We first apply the general result (10.9) to find an expression for the. 1(z1). In doing so it is useful to note that on the right-hand side we. optimal factor q. only need to retain those terms that have some functional dependence on z1 because. all other terms can be absorbed into the normalization constant. Thus we have. ln q. 1(z1) = Ez2[ln p(z)] + const. 10.1. Variational Inference. 467. 1. 2. (z1 − µ1)2Λ11 − (z1 − µ1)Λ12(z2 − µ2). = Ez2. 1. 1Λ11 + z1µ1Λ11 − z1Λ12 (E[z2] − µ2) + const.. 2 z2. + const. (10.11). Next we observe that the right-hand side of this expression is a quadratic function of. z1, and so we can identify q(z1) as a Gaussian distribution. It is worth emphasizing. that we did not assume that q(zi) is Gaussian, but rather we derived this result by. variational optimization of the KL divergence over all possible distributions q(zi).. Note also that we do not need to consider the additive constant in (10.9) explicitly. because it represents the normalization constant that can be found at the end by. inspection if required. Using the technique of completing the square, we can identify. the mean and precision of this Gaussian, giving. Section 2.3.1. q(z1) = N (z1|m1, Λ−1. 11 ). where. By symmetry, q. 11 Λ12 (E[z2] − µ2) .. 2(z2) is also Gaussian and can be written as. m1 = µ1 − Λ−1. 2(z2) = N (z2|m2, Λ−1. 22 ). q. (10.12). (10.13). (10.14). in which. m2 = µ2 − Λ−1. 22 Λ21 (E[z1] − µ1) .. (10.15). Note that these solutions are coupled, so that q(z1) depends on expectations com-. puted with respect to q(z2) and vice versa. In general, we address this by treating. the variational solutions as re-estimation equations and cycling through the variables. in turn updating them until some convergence criterion is satisfied. We shall see. an example of this shortly. Here, however, we note that the problem is sufficiently. simple that a closed form solution can be found. In particular, because E[z1] = m1. and E[z2] = m2, we see that the two equations are satisfied if we take E[z1] = µ1. and E[z2] = µ2, and it is easily shown that this is the only solution provided the dis-. tribution is nonsingular. This result is illustrated in Figure 10.2(a). We see that the. mean is correctly captured but that the variance of q(z) is controlled by the direction. of smallest variance of p(z), and that the variance along the orthogonal direction is. significantly under-estimated. It is a general result that a factorized variational ap-. proximation tends to give approximations to the posterior distribution that are too. compact.. By way of comparison, suppose instead that we had been minimizing the reverse. Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(pq). As we shall see, this form of KL divergence. Exercise 10.2. 468. 10.

Exercise 10.3. is used in an alternative approximate inference framework called expectation prop-. agation. We therefore consider the general problem of minimizing KL(pq) when. q(Z) is a factorized approximation of the form (10.5). The KL divergence can then. be written in the form. KL(pq) = −. p(Z). ln qi(Zi). dZ + const. (10.16). where the constant term is simply the entropy of p(Z) and so does not depend on. q(Z). We can now optimize with respect to each of the factors qj(Zj), which is. easily done using a Lagrange multiplier to give. j (Zj) =. q. p(Z). dZi = p(Zj).. (10.17). In this case, we find that the optimal solution for qj(Zj) is just given by the corre-. sponding marginal distribution of p(Z). Note that this is a closed-form solution and. so does not require iteration.. To apply this result to the illustrative example of a Gaussian distribution p(z). over a vector z we can use (2.98), which gives the result shown in Figure 10.2(b).. We see that once again the mean of the approximation is correct, but that it places. significant probability mass in regions of variable space that have very low probabil-. ity.. The difference between these two results can be understood by noting that there. is a large positive contribution to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. KL(qp) = −. q(Z) ln. p(Z). q(Z). dZ.

(a) The blue. contours show a bimodal distribution p(Z) given by a mixture of two Gaussians, and the red contours correspond. to the single Gaussian distribution q(Z) that best approximates p(Z) in the sense of minimizing the Kullback-. Leibler divergence KL(pq). (b) As in (a) but now the red contours correspond to a Gaussian distribution q(Z). found by numerical minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(qp). (c) As in (b) but showing a different. local minimum of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.. from regions of Z space in which p(Z) is near zero unless q(Z) is also close to. zero. Thus minimizing this form of KL divergence leads to distributions q(Z) that. avoid regions in which p(Z) is small. Conversely, the Kullback-Leibler divergence. KL(pq) is minimized by distributions q(Z) that are nonzero in regions where p(Z). is nonzero.. We can gain further insight into the different behaviour of the two KL diver-. gences if we consider approximating a multimodal distribution by a unimodal one,. as illustrated in Figure 10.3.. In practical applications, the true posterior distri-. bution will often be multimodal, with most of the posterior mass concentrated in. some number of relatively small regions of parameter space. These multiple modes. may arise through nonidentifiability in the latent space or through complex nonlin-. ear dependence on the parameters. Both types of multimodality were encountered in. Chapter 9 in the context of Gaussian mixtures, where they manifested themselves as. multiple maxima in the likelihood function, and a variational treatment based on the. minimization of KL(qp) will tend to find one of these modes. By contrast, if we. were to minimize KL(pq), the resulting approximations would average across all. of the modes and, in the context of the mixture model, would lead to poor predictive. distributions (because the average of two good parameter values is typically itself. not a good parameter value). It is possible to make use of KL(pq) to define a useful. inference procedure, but this requires a rather different approach to the one discussed. here, and will be considered in detail when we discuss expectation propagation.. The two forms of Kullback-Leibler divergence are members of the alpha family. Section 10.7. N. n=1. 470. 10.

(10.19). where −∞ < α < ∞ is a continuous parameter. The Kullback-Leibler divergence. KL(pq) corresponds to the limit α → 1, whereas KL(qp) corresponds to the limit. α → −1. For all values of α we have Dα(pq) � 0, with equality if, and only if,. p(x) = q(x). Suppose p(x) is a fixed distribution, and we minimize Dα(pq) with. respect to some set of distributions q(x). Then for α � −1 the divergence is zero. forcing, so that any values of x for which p(x) = 0 will have q(x) = 0, and typically. q(x) will under-estimate the support of p(x) and will tend to seek the mode with the. largest mass. Conversely for α � 1 the divergence is zero-avoiding, so that values. of x for which p(x) > 0 will have q(x) > 0, and typically q(x) will stretch to cover. all of p(x), and will over-estimate the support of p(x). When α = 0 we obtain a. symmetric divergence that is linearly related to the Hellinger distance given by. DH(pq) =. p(x)1/2 − q(x)1/2. dx.. (10.20). The square root of the Hellinger distance is a valid distance metric.. "
181,10.1.3,Example: The univariate Gaussian,"We now illustrate the factorized variational approximation using a Gaussian dis-. tribution over a single variable x (MacKay, 2003). Our goal is to infer the posterior. distribution for the mean µ and precision τ , given a data set D = {x1, . . . , xN} of. observed values of x which are assumed to be drawn independently from the Gaus-. sian. The likelihood function is given by. p(D|µ, τ) =. N/2. 2π. exp. 2. (xn − µ)2. (10.21). We now introduce conjugate prior distributions for µ and τ given by. µ|µ0, (λ0τ)−1. p(µ|τ) = N. p(τ) = Gam(τ|a0, b0). (10.22). (10.23). where Gam(τ|a0, b0) is the gamma distribution defined by (2.146). Together these. distributions constitute a Gaussian-Gamma conjugate prior distribution.. For this simple problem the posterior distribution can be found exactly, and again. takes the form of a Gaussian-gamma distribution. However, for tutorial purposes. we will consider a factorized variational approximation to the posterior distribution. given by. q(µ, τ) = qµ(µ)qτ (τ).. (10.24). Exercise 10.6. Section 2.3.6. Exercise 2.44. n=1. n=1. N. N. 10.1. Variational Inference. 471. Note that the true posterior distribution does not factorize in this way. The optimum. factors qµ(µ) and qτ (τ) can be obtained from the general result (10.9) as follows.. For qµ(µ) we have. ln q. µ(µ) = Eτ [ln p(D|µ, τ) + ln p(µ|τ)] + const. (xn − µ)2. λ0(µ − µ0)2 +.

Similarly, the optimal solution for the factor qτ (τ) is given by. ln q. τ (τ) = Eµ [ln p(D|µ, τ) + ln p(µ|τ)] + ln p(τ) + const. = (a0 − 1) ln τ − b0τ + N. 2. ln τ. 2 Eµ.

It should be emphasized that we did not assume these specific functional forms. for the optimal distributions qµ(µ) and qτ (τ). They arose naturally from the structure. of the likelihood function and the corresponding conjugate priors.. Thus we have expressions for the optimal distributions qµ(µ) and qτ (τ) each of. which depends on moments evaluated with respect to the other distribution. One ap-. proach to finding a solution is therefore to make an initial guess for, say, the moment. E[τ] and use this to re-compute the distribution qµ(µ). Given this revised distri-. bution we can then extract the required moments E[µ] and E[µ2], and use these to. recompute the distribution qτ (τ), and so on. Since the space of hidden variables for. this example is only two dimensional, we can illustrate the variational approxima-. tion to the posterior distribution by plotting contours of both the true posterior and. the factorized approximation, as illustrated in Figure 10.4.. 10.

(d) Contours of the optimal factorized approximation, to which the iterative scheme converges, are. shown in red.. In general, we will need to use an iterative approach such as this in order to. solve for the optimal factorized posterior distribution. For the very simple example. we are considering here, however, we can find an explicit solution by solving the. simultaneous equations for the optimal factors qµ(µ) and qτ (τ). Before doing this,. we can simplify these expressions by considering broad, noninformative priors in. which µ0 = a0 = b0 = λ0 = 0. Although these parameter settings correspond to. improper priors, we see that the posterior distribution is still well defined. Using the. standard result E[τ] = aN /bN for the mean of a gamma distribution, together with. (10.29) and (10.30), we have. Appendix B. N. 1. E[τ]. = E. 1. N. (xn − µ)2. = x2 − 2xE[µ] + E[µ2].. n=1.

We can now substitute these moments into (10.31) and then solve for E[τ] to give. We recognize the right-hand side as the familiar unbiased estimator for the variance. of a univariate Gaussian distribution, and so we see that the use of a Bayesian ap-. proach has avoided the bias of the maximum likelihood solution.. "
182,10.1.4,Model comparison,"As well as performing inference over the hidden variables Z, we may also. wish to compare a set of candidate models, labelled by the index m, and having. prior probabilities p(m). Our goal is then to approximate the posterior probabilities. p(m|X), where X is the observed data. This is a slightly more complex situation. than that considered so far because different models may have different structure. and indeed different dimensionality for the hidden variables Z. We cannot there-. fore simply consider a factorized approximation q(Z)q(m), but must instead recog-. nize that the posterior over Z must be conditioned on m, and so we must consider. q(Z, m) = q(Z|m)q(m). We can readily verify the following decomposition based. on this variational distribution. ln p(X) = Lm −. q(Z|m)q(m) ln. p(Z, m|X). q(Z|m)q(m). where the Lm is a lower bound on ln p(X) and is given by. Lm =. m. Z. q(Z|m)q(m) ln. p(Z, X, m). q(Z|m)q(m). Here we are assuming discrete Z, but the same analysis applies to continuous latent. variables provided the summations are replaced with integrations. We can maximize. Lm with respect to the distribution q(m) using a Lagrange multiplier, with the result. (10.36). However, if we maximize Lm with respect to the q(Z|m), we find that the solutions. for different m are coupled, as we expect because they are conditioned on m. We. proceed instead by first optimizing each of the q(Z|m) individually by optimization. q(m) ∝ p(m) exp{Lm}.. 474. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. N. K. K. N. K. 10.2..

After nor-. malization the resulting values for q(m) can be used for model selection or model. averaging in the usual way.. Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians. We now return to our discussion of the Gaussian mixture model and apply the vari-. ational inference machinery developed in the previous section. This will provide a. good illustration of the application of variational methods and will also demonstrate. how a Bayesian treatment elegantly resolves many of the difficulties associated with. the maximum likelihood approach (Attias, 1999b). The reader is encouraged to work. through this example in detail as it provides many insights into the practical appli-. cation of variational methods. Many Bayesian models, corresponding to much more. sophisticated distributions, can be solved by straightforward extensions and general-. izations of this analysis.. Our starting point is the likelihood function for the Gaussian mixture model, il-. lustrated by the graphical model in Figure 9.6. For each observation xn we have. a corresponding latent variable zn comprising a 1-of-K binary vector with ele-. ments znk for k = 1, . . . , K. As before we denote the observed data set by X =. {x1, . . . , xN}, and similarly we denote the latent variables by Z = {z1, . . . , zN}.. From (9.10) we can write down the conditional distribution of Z, given the mixing. coefficients π, in the form. p(Z|π) =. πznk. k. n=1. k=1. (10.37). Similarly, from (9.11), we can write down the conditional distribution of the ob-. served data vectors, given the latent variables and the component parameters. p(X|Z, µ, Λ) =. N. n=1. k=1. xn|µk, Λ−1. k. znk. (10.38). where µ = {µk} and Λ = {Λk}. Note that we are working in terms of precision. matrices rather than covariance matrices as this somewhat simplifies the mathemat-. ics.. Next we introduce priors over the parameters µ, Λ and π. The analysis is con-. siderably simplified if we use conjugate prior distributions. We therefore choose a. Dirichlet distribution over the mixing coefficients π. p(π) = Dir(π|α0) = C(α0). πα0−1. k. k=1. (10.39). where by symmetry we have chosen the same parameter α0 for each of the compo-. nents, and C(α0) is the normalization constant for the Dirichlet distribution defined. K. "

As we have seen, the parameter α0 can be interpreted as the effective. prior number of observations associated with each component of the mixture. If the. value of α0 is small, then the posterior distribution will be influenced primarily by. the data rather than by the prior.. Similarly, we introduce an independent Gaussian-Wishart prior governing the. mean and precision of each Gaussian component, given by. p(µ, Λ) = p(µ|Λ)p(Λ). k=1. N. µk|m0, (β0Λk)−1. W(Λk|W0, ν0). (10.40). because this represents the conjugate prior distribution when both the mean and pre-. cision are unknown. Typically we would choose m0 = 0 by symmetry.. The resulting model can be represented as a directed graph as shown in Fig-. ure 10.5. Note that there is a link from Λ to µ since the variance of the distribution. over µ in (10.40) is a function of Λ.. This example provides a nice illustration of the distinction between latent vari-. ables and parameters. Variables such as zn that appear inside the plate are regarded. as latent variables because the number of such variables grows with the size of the. data set. By contrast, variables such as µ that are outside the plate are fixed in. number independently of the size of the data set, and so are regarded as parameters.. From the perspective of graphical models, however, there is really no fundamental. difference between them.. "
184,10.2.1,Variational distribution,"In order to formulate a variational treatment of this model, we next write down. the joint distribution of all of the random variables, which is given by. p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ) = p(X|Z, µ, Λ)p(Z|π)p(π)p(µ|Λ)p(Λ). (10.41). in which the various factors are defined above.

We now consider a variational distribution which factorizes between the latent. variables and the parameters so that. q(Z, π, µ, Λ) = q(Z)q(π, µ, Λ).. (10.42). It is remarkable that this is the only assumption that we need to make in order to. obtain a tractable practical solution to our Bayesian mixture model. In particular, the. functional form of the factors q(Z) and q(π, µ, Λ) will be determined automatically. by optimization of the variational distribution. Note that we are omitting the sub-. scripts on the q distributions, much as we do with the p distributions in (10.41), and. are relying on the arguments to distinguish the different distributions.. The corresponding sequential update equations for these factors can be easily. derived by making use of the general result (10.9). Let us consider the derivation of. the update equation for the factor q(Z). The log of the optimized factor is given by. ln q(Z) = Eπ,µ,Λ[ln p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ)] + const.. (10.43). We now make use of the decomposition (10.41). Note that we are only interested in. the functional dependence of the right-hand side on the variable Z. Thus any terms. that do not depend on Z can be absorbed into the additive normalization constant,. giving. ln q(Z) = Eπ[ln p(Z|π)] + Eµ,Λ[ln p(X|Z, µ, Λ)] + const.. (10.44). Substituting for the two conditional distributions on the right-hand side, and again. absorbing any terms that are independent of Z into the additive constant, we have. ln q(Z) =. n=1. where we have defined. znk ln ρnk + const. ln ρnk = E[ln πk] +.

Taking the exponential of both. sides of (10.45) we obtain. q(Z) ∝. ρznk. nk .. (10.47). Exercise 10.12. Requiring that this distribution be normalized, and noting that for each value of n. the quantities znk are binary and sum to 1 over all values of k, we obtain. q(Z) =. rznk. nk. n=1. k=1.

We see that the optimal solution for the factor q(Z) takes the same functional form. as the prior p(Z|π). Note that because ρnk is given by the exponential of a real. quantity, the quantities rnk will be nonnegative and will sum to one, as required.. For the discrete distribution q(Z) we have the standard result. E[znk] = rnk. (10.50). from which we see that the quantities rnk are playing the role of responsibilities.. Note that the optimal solution for q(Z) depends on moments evaluated with respect. to the distributions of other variables, and so again the variational update equations. are coupled and must be solved iteratively.. At this point, we shall find it convenient to define three statistics of the observed. data set evaluated with respect to the responsibilities, given by. 477. (10.49). (10.51). (10.52). (10.53). Nk =. xk =. rnkxn. Sk =. rnk(xn − xk)(xn − xk)T.. Note that these are analogous to quantities evaluated in the maximum likelihood EM. algorithm for the Gaussian mixture model.. Now let us consider the factor q(π, µ, Λ) in the variational posterior distribu-. tion. Again using the general result (10.9) we have. ln q(π, µ, Λ) = ln p(π) +. ln p(µk, Λk) + EZ [ln p(Z|π)]. k=1. n=1. E[znk] lnN. xn|µk, Λ−1. k. + const.. (10.54). We observe that the right-hand side of this expression decomposes into a sum of. terms involving only π together with terms only involving µ and Λ, which implies. that the variational posterior q(π, µ, Λ) factorizes to give q(π)q(µ, Λ). Further-. more, the terms involving µ and Λ themselves comprise a sum over k of terms. involving µk and Λk leading to the further factorization. q(π, µ, Λ) = q(π). q(µk, Λk).. (10.55). k=1. k=1. K.

(10.56). where we have used (10.50). Taking the exponential of both sides, we recognize. q(π) as a Dirichlet distribution. q(π) = Dir(π|α). (10.57). where α has components αk given by. αk = α0 + Nk.. (10.58). Finally, the variational posterior distribution q(µk, Λk) does not factorize into. the product of the marginals, but we can always use the product rule to write it in the. form q(µk, Λk) = q(µk|Λk)q(Λk). The two factors can be found by inspecting. (10.54) and reading off those terms that involve µk and Λk. The result, as expected,. is a Gaussian-Wishart distribution and is given by. µk|mk, (βkΛk)−1. q(µk, Λk) = N. W(Λk|Wk, νk). (10.59). where we have defined. βk = β0 + Nk. mk =. 1. βk. = W−1.

These update equations are analogous to the M-step equations of the EM algorithm. for the maximum likelihood solution of the mixture of Gaussians. We see that the. computations that must be performed in order to update the variational posterior. distribution over the model parameters involve evaluation of the same sums over the. data set, as arose in the maximum likelihood treatment.. In order to perform this variational M step, we need the expectations E[znk] =. rnk representing the responsibilities. These are obtained by normalizing the ρnk that. are given by (10.46). We see that this expression involves expectations with respect. to the variational distributions of the parameters, and these are easily evaluated to. give. Eµk,Λk.

The results (10.65) and (10.66) follow from. Λk and. If we substitute (10.64), (10.65), and (10.66) into (10.46) and make use of. (10.49), we obtain the following result for the responsibilities. rnk ∝. πk. Λ1/2. k. exp. D. 2βk −. νk. 2. (xn − mk)TWk(xn − mk). (10.67). Notice the similarity to the corresponding result for the responsibilities in maximum. likelihood EM, which from (9.13) can be written in the form. rnk ∝ πk|Λk|1/2 exp. 1. 2. (xn − µk)TΛk(xn − µk). (10.68). where we have used the precision in place of the covariance to highlight the similarity. to (10.67).. Thus the optimization of the variational posterior distribution involves cycling. between two stages analogous to the E and M steps of the maximum likelihood EM. algorithm. In the variational equivalent of the E step, we use the current distributions. over the model parameters to evaluate the moments in (10.64), (10.65), and (10.66). and hence evaluate E[znk] = rnk. Then in the subsequent variational equivalent. of the M step, we keep these responsibilities fixed and use them to re-compute the. variational distribution over the parameters using (10.57) and (10.59). In each case,. we see that the variational posterior distribution has the same functional form as the. corresponding factor in the joint distribution (10.41). This is a general result and is. a consequence of the choice of conjugate distributions.. Figure 10.6 shows the results of applying this approach to the rescaled Old Faith-. ful data set for a Gaussian mixture model having K = 6 components. We see that. after convergence, there are only two components for which the expected values. of the mixing coefficients are numerically distinguishable from their prior values.. This effect can be understood qualitatively in terms of the automatic trade-off in a. Bayesian model between fitting the data and the complexity of the model, in which. the complexity penalty arises from components whose parameters are pushed away. from their prior values. Components that take essentially no responsibility for ex-. plaining the data points have rnk  0 and hence Nk  0. From (10.58), we see. that αk  α0 and from (10.60)–(10.63) we see that the other parameters revert to. their prior values. In principle such components are fitted slightly to the data points,. but for broad priors this effect is too small to be seen numerically. For the varia-. tional Gaussian mixture model the expected values of the mixing coefficients in the. posterior distribution are given by. E[πk] = αk + Nk. Kα0 + N. (10.69). Consider a component for which Nk  0 and αk  α0. If the prior is broad so that. α0 → 0, then E[πk] → 0 and the component plays no role in the model, whereas if. 480. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE.

In Figure 10.6, the prior over the mixing coefficients is a Dirichlet of the form. (10.39). Recall from Figure 2.5 that for α0 < 1 the prior favours solutions in which. some of the mixing coefficients are zero. Figure 10.6 was obtained using α0 = 10−3,. and resulted in two components having nonzero mixing coefficients. If instead we. choose α0 = 1 we obtain three components with nonzero mixing coefficients, and. for α = 10 all six components have nonzero mixing coefficients.. As we have seen there is a close similarity between the variational solution for. the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians and the EM algorithm for maximum likelihood.. In fact if we consider the limit N → ∞ then the Bayesian treatment converges to the. maximum likelihood EM algorithm. For anything other than very small data sets,. the dominant computational cost of the variational algorithm for Gaussian mixtures. arises from the evaluation of the responsibilities, together with the evaluation and. inversion of the weighted data covariance matrices. These computations mirror pre-. cisely those that arise in the maximum likelihood EM algorithm, and so there is little. computational overhead in using this Bayesian approach as compared to the tradi-. tional maximum likelihood one. There are, however, some substantial advantages.. First of all, the singularities that arise in maximum likelihood when a Gaussian com-. ponent ‘collapses’ onto a specific data point are absent in the Bayesian treatment.. k=1. K. N. K. K. Section 10.2.4. Exercise 10.16. 10.2. Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians. 481. Indeed, these singularities are removed if we simply introduce a prior and then use a. MAP estimate instead of maximum likelihood. Furthermore, there is no over-fitting. if we choose a large number K of components in the mixture, as we saw in Fig-. ure 10.6. Finally, the variational treatment opens up the possibility of determining. the optimal number of components in the mixture without resorting to techniques. such as cross validation.. "
185,10.2.2,Variational lower bound,"We can also straightforwardly evaluate the lower bound (10.3) for this model.. In practice, it is useful to be able to monitor the bound during the re-estimation in. order to test for convergence. It can also provide a valuable check on both the math-. ematical expressions for the solutions and their software implementation, because at. each step of the iterative re-estimation procedure the value of this bound should not. decrease. We can take this a stage further to provide a deeper test of the correctness. of both the mathematical derivation of the update equations and of their software im-. plementation by using finite differences to check that each update does indeed give. a (constrained) maximum of the bound (Svens´en and Bishop, 2004).. For the variational mixture of Gaussians, the lower bound (10.3) is given by. L =. q(Z, π, µ, Λ) ln. p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ). dπ dµ dΛ. Z. q(Z, π, µ, Λ). = E[ln p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ)] − E[ln q(Z, π, µ, Λ)]. = E[ln p(X|Z, µ, Λ)] + E[ln p(Z|π)] + E[ln p(π)] + E[ln p(µ, Λ)]. −E[ln q(Z)] − E[ln q(π)] − E[ln q(µ, Λ)]. (10.70). where, to keep the notation uncluttered, we have omitted the  superscript on the. q distributions, along with the subscripts on the expectation operators because each. expectation is taken with respect to all of the random variables in its argument.

Note that the terms involving expectations of the logs of the. q distributions simply represent the negative entropies of those distributions. Some. simplifications and combination of terms can be performed when these expressions. are summed to give the lower bound. However, we have kept the expressions sepa-. rate for ease of understanding.. Finally, it is worth noting that the lower bound provides an alternative approach. for deriving the variational re-estimation equations obtained in Section 10.2.1. To do. this we use the fact that, since the model has conjugate priors, the functional form of. the factors in the variational posterior distribution is known, namely discrete for Z,. Dirichlet for π, and Gaussian-Wishart for (µk, Λk). By taking general parametric. forms for these distributions we can derive the form of the lower bound as a function. of the parameters of the distributions. Maximizing the bound with respect to these. parameters then gives the required re-estimation equations.. "

187,10.2.4,Determining the number of components,"We have seen that the variational lower bound can be used to determine a pos-. terior distribution over the number K of components in the mixture model. There. is, however, one subtlety that needs to be addressed. For any given setting of the. parameters in a Gaussian mixture model (except for specific degenerate settings),. there will exist other parameter settings for which the density over the observed vari-. ables will be identical. These parameter values differ only through a re-labelling of. the components. For instance, consider a mixture of two Gaussians and a single ob-. served variable x, in which the parameters have the values π1 = a, π2 = b, µ1 = c,. µ2 = d, σ1 = e, σ2 = f. Then the parameter values π1 = b, π2 = a, µ1 = d,. µ2 = c, σ1 = f, σ2 = e, in which the two components have been exchanged, will. by symmetry give rise to the same value of p(x). If we have a mixture model com-. prising K components, then each parameter setting will be a member of a family of. K! equivalent settings.. In the context of maximum likelihood, this redundancy is irrelevant because the. parameter optimization algorithm (for example EM) will, depending on the initial-. ization of the parameters, find one specific solution, and the other equivalent solu-. tions play no role. In a Bayesian setting, however, we marginalize over all possible. 484. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. Figure 10.7 Plot of the variational lower bound.

We have seen in Figure 10.2 that if the true posterior distribution. is multimodal, variational inference based on the minimization of KL(qp) will tend. to approximate the distribution in the neighbourhood of one of the modes and ignore. the others. Again, because equivalent modes have equivalent predictive densities,. this is of no concern provided we are considering a model having a specific number. K of components. If, however, we wish to compare different values of K, then we. need to take account of this multimodality. A simple approximate solution is to add. a term ln K! onto the lower bound when used for model comparison and averaging.. Figure 10.7 shows a plot of the lower bound, including the multimodality fac-. tor, versus the number K of components for the Old Faithful data set. It is worth. emphasizing once again that maximum likelihood would lead to values of the likeli-. hood function that increase monotonically with K (assuming the singular solutions. have been avoided, and discounting the effects of local maxima) and so cannot be. used to determine an appropriate model complexity. By contrast, Bayesian inference. automatically makes the trade-off between model complexity and fitting the data.. This approach to the determination of K requires that a range of models having. different K values be trained and compared. An alternative approach to determining. a suitable value for K is to treat the mixing coefficients π as parameters and make. point estimates of their values by maximizing the lower bound (Corduneanu and. Bishop, 2001) with respect to π instead of maintaining a probability distribution. over them as in the fully Bayesian approach. This leads to the re-estimation equation. Exercise 10.22. Section 3.4.

This allows us to make a single training run in which we. start with a relatively large initial value of K, and allow surplus components to be. pruned out of the model. The origins of the sparsity when optimizing with respect to. hyperparameters is discussed in detail in the context of the relevance vector machine.. "
188,10.2.5,Induced factorizations,"In deriving these variational update equations for the Gaussian mixture model,. we assumed a particular factorization of the variational posterior distribution given. by (10.42). However, the optimal solutions for the various factors exhibit additional. factorizations. In particular, the solution for q(µ, Λ) is given by the product of an. independent distribution q(µk, Λk) over each of the components k of the mixture,. whereas the variational posterior distribution q(Z) over the latent variables, given. by (10.48), factorizes into an independent distribution q(zn) for each observation n. (note that it does not further factorize with respect to k because, for each value of n,. the znk are constrained to sum to one over k). These additional factorizations are a. consequence of the interaction between the assumed factorization and the conditional. independence properties of the true distribution, as characterized by the directed. graph in Figure 10.5.. We shall refer to these additional factorizations as induced factorizations be-. cause they arise from an interaction between the factorization assumed in the varia-. tional posterior distribution and the conditional independence properties of the true. joint distribution. In a numerical implementation of the variational approach it is. important to take account of such additional factorizations. For instance, it would. be very inefficient to maintain a full precision matrix for the Gaussian distribution. over a set of variables if the optimal form for that distribution always had a diago-. nal precision matrix (corresponding to a factorization with respect to the individual. variables described by that Gaussian).. Such induced factorizations can easily be detected using a simple graphical test. based on d-separation as follows. We partition the latent variables into three disjoint. groups A, B, C and then let us suppose that we are assuming a factorization between. C and the remaining latent variables, so that. q(A, B, C) = q(A, B)q(C).. (10.84). Using the general result (10.9), together with the product rule for probabilities, we. see that the optimal solution for q(A, B) is given by. ln q(A, B) = EC[ln p(X, A, B, C)] + const. = EC[ln p(A, B|X, C)] + const.. (10.85). We now ask whether this resulting solution will factorize between A and B, in. other words whether q(A, B) = q(A)q(B). This will happen if, and only if,. ln p(A, B|X, C) = ln p(A|X, C) + ln p(B|X, C), that is, if the conditional inde-. pendence relation. (10.86). A ⊥⊥ B | X, C. 486. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. is satisfied. We can test to see if this relation does hold, for any choice of A and B. by making use of the d-separation criterion.. To illustrate this, consider again the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians represented. by the directed graph in Figure 10.5, in which we are assuming a variational fac-. torization given by (10.42). We can see immediately that the variational posterior. distribution over the parameters must factorize between π and the remaining param-. eters µ and Λ because all paths connecting π to either µ or Λ must pass through. one of the nodes zn all of which are in the conditioning set for our conditional inde-. pendence test and all of which are head-to-tail with respect to such paths.. "
189,10.3,Variational Linear Regression,"N. As a second illustration of variational inference, we return to the Bayesian linear. regression model of Section 3.3. In the evidence framework, we approximated the. integration over α and β by making point estimates obtained by maximizing the log. marginal likelihood. A fully Bayesian approach would integrate over the hyperpa-. rameters as well as over the parameters. Although exact integration is intractable,. we can use variational methods to find a tractable approximation. In order to sim-. plify the discussion, we shall suppose that the noise precision parameter β is known,. and is fixed to its true value, although the framework is easily extended to include. the distribution over β. For the linear regression model, the variational treatment. will turn out to be equivalent to the evidence framework. Nevertheless, it provides a. good exercise in the use of variational methods and will also lay the foundation for. variational treatment of Bayesian logistic regression in Section 10.6.. Recall that the likelihood function for w, and the prior over w, are given by. Exercise 10.26. N (tn|wTφn, β−1). p(t|w) =. p(w|α) = N (w|0, α−1I). n=1. (10.87). (10.88). where φn = φ(xn). We now introduce a prior distribution over α. From our dis-. cussion in Section 2.3.6, we know that the conjugate prior for the precision of a. Gaussian is given by a gamma distribution, and so we choose. (10.89). where Gam(·|·,·) is defined by (B.26). Thus the joint distribution of all the variables. is given by. (10.90). p(α) = Gam(α|a0, b0). p(t, w, α) = p(t|w)p(w|α)p(α).. This can be represented as a directed graphical model as shown in Figure 10.8.. "
190,10.3.1,Variational distribution,"Our first goal is to find an approximation to the posterior distribution p(w, α|t).. To do this, we employ the variational framework of Section 10.1, with a variational. 10.3. Variational Linear Regression.

We can find re-estimation equations for the factors in this distribution by making use. of the general result (10.9). Recall that for each factor, we take the log of the joint. distribution over all variables and then average with respect to those variables not in. that factor. Consider first the distribution over α. Keeping only terms that have a. functional dependence on α, we have. ln q(α) = ln p(α) + Ew [ln p(w|α)] + const. = (a0 − 1) ln α − b0α + M. 2. ln α −. 2 E[wTw] + const..

Similarly, we can find the variational re-estimation equation for the posterior. distribution over w.

Note the close similarity to the posterior distribution (3.52) obtained when α was. treated as a fixed parameter. The difference is that here α is replaced by its expecta-. tion E[α] under the variational distribution. Indeed, we have chosen to use the same. notation for the covariance matrix SN in both cases.. Using the standard results (B.27), (B.38), and (B.39), we can obtain the required. moments as follows. E[α] = aN /bN. E[wwT] = mN mT. N + SN .. (10.102). (10.103). The evaluation of the variational posterior distribution begins by initializing the pa-. rameters of one of the distributions q(w) or q(α), and then alternately re-estimates. these factors in turn until a suitable convergence criterion is satisfied (usually speci-. fied in terms of the lower bound to be discussed shortly).. It is instructive to relate the variational solution to that found using the evidence. framework in Section 3.5. To do this consider the case a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding. to the limit of an infinitely broad prior over α. The mean of the variational posterior. distribution q(α) is then given by. E[α] = aN. bN. = M/2. E[wTw]/2. M. N mN + Tr(SN ) .. mT. (10.104). Comparison with (9.63) shows that in the case of this particularly simple model,. the variational approach gives precisely the same expression as that obtained by. maximizing the evidence function using EM except that the point estimate for α. is replaced by its expected value. Because the distribution q(w) depends on q(α). only through the expectation E[α], we see that the two approaches will give identical. results for the case of an infinitely broad prior.. "

192,10.3.3,Lower bound,"Another quantity of importance is the lower bound L defined by.

Figure 10.9 shows a plot of the lower bound L(q) versus the degree of a polynomial. model for a synthetic data set generated from a degree three polynomial. Here the. prior parameters have been set to a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding to the noninformative. prior p(α) ∝ 1/α, which is uniform over ln α as discussed in Section 2.3.6. As. we saw in Section 10.1, the quantity L represents lower bound on the log marginal. likelihood p(t|M) for the model. If we assign equal prior probabilities p(M) to the. different values of M, then we can interpret L as an approximation to the poste-. rior model probability p(M|t). Thus the variational framework assigns the highest. probability to the model with M = 3. This should be contrasted with the maximum. likelihood result, which assigns ever smaller residual error to models of increasing. complexity until the residual error is driven to zero, causing maximum likelihood to. favour severely over-fitted models..

193,10.4,Exponential Family Distributions,"In Chapter 2, we discussed the important role played by the exponential family of. distributions and their conjugate priors. For many of the models discussed in this. book, the complete-data likelihood is drawn from the exponential family. However,. in general this will not be the case for the marginal likelihood function for the ob-. served data. For example, in a mixture of Gaussians, the joint distribution of obser-. vations xn and corresponding hidden variables zn is a member of the exponential. family, whereas the marginal distribution of xn is a mixture of Gaussians and hence. is not.. Up to now we have grouped the variables in the model into observed variables. and hidden variables. We now make a further distinction between latent variables,. denoted Z, and parameters, denoted θ, where parameters are intensive (fixed in num-. ber independent of the size of the data set), whereas latent variables are extensive. (scale in number with the size of the data set). For example, in a Gaussian mixture. model, the indicator variables zkn (which specify which component k is responsible. for generating data point xn) represent the latent variables, whereas the means µk,. precisions Λk and mixing proportions πk represent the parameters.. Consider the case of independent identically distributed data. We denote the. data values by X = {xn}, where n = 1, . . . N, with corresponding latent variables. Z = {zn}. Now suppose that the joint distribution of observed and latent variables. is a member of the exponential family, parameterized by natural parameters η so that. p(X, Z|η) =. n=1. h(xn, zn)g(η) exp. ηTu(xn, zn). (10.113). We shall also use a conjugate prior for η, which can be written as. p(η|ν0, v0) = f(ν0, χ0)g(η)ν0 exp. νoηTχ0. (10.114). Recall that the conjugate prior distribution can be interpreted as a prior number ν0. of observations all having the value χ0 for the u vector. Now consider a variational. n=1. N. n=1. 10.4. Exponential Family Distributions. 491. distribution that factorizes between the latent variables and the parameters, so that. q(Z, η) = q(Z)q(η). Using the general result (10.9), we can solve for the two. factors as follows. ln q(Z) = Eη[ln p(X, Z|η)] + const. ln h(xn, zn) + E[ηT]u(xn, zn). + const. (10.115). Section 10.2.5. Thus we see that this decomposes into a sum of independent terms, one for each. value of n, and hence the solution for q(Z) will factorize over n so that q(Z) =. n q(zn). This is an example of an induced factorization. Taking the exponential. of both sides, we have. q(zn) = h(xn, zn)g (E[η]) exp. E[ηT]u(xn, zn). (10.116). where the normalization coefficient has been re-instated by comparison with the. standard form for the exponential family.. Similarly, for the variational distribution over the parameters, we have. ln q(η) = ln p(η|ν0, χ0) + EZ[ln p(X, Z|η)] + const. ln g(η) + ηTEzn[u(xn, zn)]. = ν0 ln g(η) + ηTχ0 +. N. (10.117). + const. (10.118). Again, taking the exponential of both sides, and re-instating the normalization coef-. ficient by inspection, we have. q(η) = f(νN , χN )g(η)νN exp. ηTχN. (10.119). where we have defined. νN = ν0 + N. N. χN = χ0 +. Ezn[u(xn, zn)].. n=1. (10.120). (10.121). Note that the solutions for q(zn) and q(η) are coupled, and so we solve them iter-. atively in a two-stage procedure. In the variational E step, we evaluate the expected. sufficient statistics E[u(xn, zn)] using the current posterior distribution q(zn) over. the latent variables and use this to compute a revised posterior distribution q(η) over. the parameters. Then in the subsequent variational M step, we use this revised pa-. rameter posterior distribution to find the expected natural parameters E[ηT], which. gives rise to a revised variational distribution over the latent variables..

194,10.4.1,Variational message passing,"We have illustrated the application of variational methods by considering a spe-. cific model, the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, in some detail. This model can be. i. i. 492. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. described by the directed graph shown in Figure 10.5. Here we consider more gen-. erally the use of variational methods for models described by directed graphs and. derive a number of widely applicable results.. The joint distribution corresponding to a directed graph can be written using the. decomposition. p(x) =. p(xi|pai). (10.122). where xi denotes the variable(s) associated with node i, and pai denotes the parent. set corresponding to node i. Note that xi may be a latent variable or it may belong. to the set of observed variables. Now consider a variational approximation in which. the distribution q(x) is assumed to factorize with respect to the xi so that. q(x) =. qi(xi).. (10.123). Note that for observed nodes, there is no factor q(xi) in the variational distribution.. We now substitute (10.122) into our general result (10.9) to give. ln q. j (xj) = Ei=j. ln p(xi|pai). + const.. i. (10.124). Any terms on the right-hand side that do not depend on xj can be absorbed into. In fact, the only terms that do depend on xj are the con-. the additive constant.. ditional distribution for xj given by p(xj|paj) together with any other conditional. distributions that have xj in the conditioning set. By definition, these conditional. distributions correspond to the children of node j, and they therefore also depend on. the co-parents of the child nodes, i.e., the other parents of the child nodes besides. node xj itself. We see that the set of all nodes on which q(xj) depends corresponds. to the Markov blanket of node xj, as illustrated in Figure 8.26. Thus the update. of the factors in the variational posterior distribution represents a local calculation. on the graph. This makes possible the construction of general purpose software for. variational inference in which the form of the model does not need to be specified in. advance (Bishop et al., 2003).. If we now specialize to the case of a model in which all of the conditional dis-. tributions have a conjugate-exponential structure, then the variational update proce-. dure can be cast in terms of a local message passing algorithm (Winn and Bishop,. 2005). In particular, the distribution associated with a particular node can be updated. once that node has received messages from all of its parents and all of its children.. This in turn requires that the children have already received messages from their co-. parents. The evaluation of the lower bound can also be simplified because many of. the required quantities are already evaluated as part of the message passing scheme.. This distributed message passing formulation has good scaling properties and is well. suited to large networks.. "
195,10.5,Local Variational Methods,"493. 10.5. Local Variational Methods. Section 1.6.1. The variational framework discussed in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 can be considered a. ‘global’ method in the sense that it directly seeks an approximation to the full poste-. rior distribution over all random variables. An alternative ‘local’ approach involves. finding bounds on functions over individual variables or groups of variables within. a model. For instance, we might seek a bound on a conditional distribution p(y|x),. which is itself just one factor in a much larger probabilistic model specified by a. directed graph. The purpose of introducing the bound of course is to simplify the. resulting distribution. This local approximation can be applied to multiple variables. in turn until a tractable approximation is obtained, and in Section 10.6.1 we shall. give a practical example of this approach in the context of logistic regression. Here. we focus on developing the bounds themselves.. We have already seen in our discussion of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that. the convexity of the logarithm function played a key role in developing the lower. bound in the global variational approach. We have defined a (strictly) convex func-. tion as one for which every chord lies above the function. Convexity also plays a. central role in the local variational framework. Note that our discussion will ap-. ply equally to concave functions with ‘min’ and ‘max’ interchanged and with lower. bounds replaced by upper bounds.. Let us begin by considering a simple example, namely the function f(x) =. exp(−x), which is a convex function of x, and which is shown in the left-hand plot. of Figure 10.10. Our goal is to approximate f(x) by a simpler function, in particular. a linear function of x. From Figure 10.10, we see that this linear function will be a. lower bound on f(x) if it corresponds to a tangent. We can obtain the tangent line. y(x) at a specific value of x, say x = ξ, by making a first order Taylor expansion. so that y(x) � f(x) with equality when x = ξ. For our example function f(x) =. y(x) = f(ξ) + f(ξ)(x − ξ). (10.125). Figure 10.10 In the left-hand fig-. ure the red curve shows the function. exp(−x), and the blue line shows. the tangent at x = ξ defined by. (10.125) with ξ = 1. This line has. slope λ = f(ξ) = − exp(−ξ). Note. that any other tangent line, for ex-. ample the ones shown in green, will. have a smaller value of y at x =. ξ. The right-hand figure shows the. corresponding plot of. the function. λξ − g(λ), where g(λ) is given by. (10.131), versus λ for ξ = 1,. in. which the maximum corresponds to. λ = − exp(−ξ) = −1/e.. 1. 0.5. λξ − g(λ). 0.4. 0.2. 0. 0. 1.5. x. 3. 0. −1. −0.5. 0. 494. 10.

Figure 10.11 In the left-hand plot the red curve shows a convex function f (x), and the blue line represents the. linear function λx, which is a lower bound on f (x) because f (x) > λx for all x. For the given value of slope λ the. contact point of the tangent line having the same slope is found by minimizing with respect to x the discrepancy. (shown by the green dashed lines) given by f (x) − λx. This defines the dual function g(λ), which corresponds. to the (negative of the) intercept of the tangent line having slope λ.. exp(−x), we therefore obtain the tangent line in the form. y(x) = exp(−ξ) − exp(−ξ)(x − ξ). which is a linear function parameterized by ξ. For consistency with subsequent. discussion, let us define λ = − exp(−ξ) so that. (10.126). (10.127). y(x, λ) = λx − λ + λ ln(−λ).. Different values of λ correspond to different tangent lines, and because all such lines. are lower bounds on the function, we have f(x) � y(x, λ). Thus we can write the. function in the form. f(x) = max. λ {λx − λ + λ ln(−λ)} .. (10.128). We have succeeded in approximating the convex function f(x) by a simpler, lin-. ear function y(x, λ). The price we have paid is that we have introduced a variational. parameter λ, and to obtain the tightest bound we must optimize with respect to λ.. We can formulate this approach more generally using the framework of convex. duality (Rockafellar, 1972; Jordan et al., 1999). Consider the illustration of a convex. function f(x) shown in the left-hand plot in Figure 10.11.. In this example, the. function λx is a lower bound on f(x) but it is not the best lower bound that can. be achieved by a linear function having slope λ, because the tightest bound is given. by the tangent line. Let us write the equation of the tangent line, having slope λ as. λx − g(λ) where the (negative) intercept g(λ) clearly depends on the slope λ of the. tangent. To determine the intercept, we note that the line must be moved vertically by. an amount equal to the smallest vertical distance between the line and the function,. as shown in Figure 10.11. Thus. g(λ) = − min. = max. x {f(x) − λx}. x {λx − f(x)} .. (10.129). 10.5. Local Variational Methods. 495. Now, instead of fixing λ and varying x, we can consider a particular x and then. adjust λ until the tangent plane is tangent at that particular x. Because the y value. of the tangent line at a particular x is maximized when that value coincides with its. contact point, we have. f(x) = max. λ {λx − g(λ)} .. (10.130). We see that the functions f(x) and g(λ) play a dual role, and are related through. (10.129) and (10.130).. Let us apply these duality relations to our simple example f(x) = exp(−x).. From (10.129) we see that the maximizing value of x is given by ξ = − ln(−λ), and. back-substituting we obtain the conjugate function g(λ) in the form. g(λ) = λ − λ ln(−λ). (10.131). as obtained previously. The function λξ − g(λ) is shown, for ξ = 1 in the right-hand. plot in Figure 10.10. As a check, we can substitute (10.131) into (10.130), which. gives the maximizing value of λ = − exp(−x), and back-substituting then recovers. the original function f(x) = exp(−x).. For concave functions, we can follow a similar argument to obtain upper bounds,. in which max’ is replaced with ‘min’, so that. f(x) = min. g(λ) = min. λ {λx − g(λ)}. x {λx − f(x)} .. (10.132). (10.133). If the function of interest is not convex (or concave), then we cannot directly. apply the method above to obtain a bound. However, we can first seek invertible. transformations either of the function or of its argument which change it into a con-. vex form. We then calculate the conjugate function and then transform back to the. original variables.. An important example, which arises frequently in pattern recognition, is the. logistic sigmoid function defined by. σ(x) =. 1. 1 + e−x .. (10.134). Exercise 10.30. As it stands this function is neither convex nor concave. However, if we take the. logarithm we obtain a function which is concave, as is easily verified by finding the. second derivative. From (10.133) the corresponding conjugate function then takes. the form. g(λ) = min. x {λx − f(x)} = −λ ln λ − (1 − λ) ln(1 − λ). (10.135). Appendix B. which we recognize as the binary entropy function for a variable whose probability. of having the value 1 is λ. Using (10.132), we then obtain an upper bound on the log. sigmoid. ln σ(x) � λx − g(λ). (10.136). 0. 496. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. 1. 0.5. 0. −6. λ = 0.2. λ = 0.7. 0. 6. 1. 0.5. ξ = 2.5. 0. −6. 6.

The right-hand plot shows the logistic. sigmoid again in red together with the Gaussian lower bound (10.144) shown in blue. Here the parameter. ξ = 2.5, and the bound is exact at x = ξ and x = −ξ, denoted by the dashed green lines.. Exercise 10.31. and taking the exponential, we obtain an upper bound on the logistic sigmoid itself. of the form. σ(x) � exp(λx − g(λ)). (10.137). which is plotted for two values of λ on the left-hand plot in Figure 10.12.. We can also obtain a lower bound on the sigmoid having the functional form of. a Gaussian. To do this, we follow Jaakkola and Jordan (2000) and make transforma-. tions both of the input variable and of the function itself. First we take the log of the. logistic function and then decompose it so that. ln σ(x) = − ln(1 + e−x) = − ln. e−x/2(ex/2 + e−x/2). = x/2 − ln(ex/2 + e−x/2).. (10.138). We now note that the function f(x) = − ln(ex/2 + e−x/2) is a convex function of. the variable x2, as can again be verified by finding the second derivative. This leads. to a lower bound on f(x), which is a linear function of x2 whose conjugate function. is given by. g(λ) = max. x2. λx2 − f. √x2.

Instead of thinking of λ as the variational parameter, we can let ξ play this role as. this leads to simpler expressions for the conjugate function, which is then given by. g(λ) = λ(ξ)ξ2 − f(ξ) = λ(ξ)ξ2 + ln(eξ/2 + e−ξ/2).. Hence the bound on f(x) can be written as. f(x) � λx2 − g(λ) = λx2 − λξ2 − ln(eξ/2 + e−ξ/2).. The bound on the sigmoid then becomes. σ(x) � σ(ξ) exp. (x − ξ)/2 − λ(ξ)(x2 − ξ2). where λ(ξ) is defined by (10.141). This bound is illustrated in the right-hand plot of. Figure 10.12. We see that the bound has the form of the exponential of a quadratic. function of x, which will prove useful when we seek Gaussian representations of. posterior distributions defined through logistic sigmoid functions.. The logistic sigmoid arises frequently in probabilistic models over binary vari-. ables because it is the function that transforms a log odds ratio into a posterior prob-. ability. The corresponding transformation for a multiclass distribution is given by. the softmax function. Unfortunately, the lower bound derived here for the logistic. sigmoid does not directly extend to the softmax. Gibbs (1997) proposes a method. for constructing a Gaussian distribution that is conjectured to be a bound (although. no rigorous proof is given), which may be used to apply local variational methods to. multiclass problems.. We shall see an example of the use of local variational bounds in Sections 10.6.1.. For the moment, however, it is instructive to consider in general terms how these. bounds can be used. Suppose we wish to evaluate an integral of the form. I =. σ(a)p(a) da. (10.145). where σ(a) is the logistic sigmoid, and p(a) is a Gaussian probability density. Such. integrals arise in Bayesian models when, for instance, we wish to evaluate the pre-. dictive distribution, in which case p(a) represents a posterior parameter distribution.. Because the integral is intractable, we employ the variational bound (10.144), which. we write in the form σ(a) � f(a, ξ) where ξ is a variational parameter. The inte-. gral now becomes the product of two exponential-quadratic functions and so can be. integrated analytically to give a bound on I. I �. f(a, ξ)p(a) da = F (ξ).. (10.146). We now have the freedom to choose the variational parameter ξ, which we do by. finding the value ξ that maximizes the function F (ξ). The resulting value F (ξ). represents the tightest bound within this family of bounds and can be used as an. approximation to I. This optimized bound, however, will in general not be exact.. n=1. N. 498. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. Although the bound σ(a) � f(a, ξ) on the logistic sigmoid can be optimized exactly,. the required choice for ξ depends on the value of a, so that the bound is exact for one. value of a only. Because the quantity F (ξ) is obtained by integrating over all values. of a, the value of ξ represents a compromise, weighted by the distribution p(a).. "
196,10.6,Variational Logistic Regression,"We now illustrate the use of local variational methods by returning to the Bayesian. logistic regression model studied in Section 4.5. There we focussed on the use of. the Laplace approximation, while here we consider a variational treatment based on. the approach of Jaakkola and Jordan (2000). Like the Laplace method, this also. leads to a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. However, the greater. flexibility of the variational approximation leads to improved accuracy compared. to the Laplace method. Furthermore (unlike the Laplace method), the variational. approach is optimizing a well defined objective function given by a rigourous bound. on the model evidence. Logistic regression has also been treated by Dybowski and. Roberts (2005) from a Bayesian perspective using Monte Carlo sampling techniques.. "
197,10.6.1,Variational posterior distribution,"Here we shall make use of a variational approximation based on the local bounds. introduced in Section 10.5. This allows the likelihood function for logistic regres-. sion, which is governed by the logistic sigmoid, to be approximated by the expo-. nential of a quadratic form. It is therefore again convenient to choose a conjugate. Gaussian prior of the form (4.140). For the moment, we shall treat the hyperparam-. eters m0 and S0 as fixed constants. In Section 10.6.3, we shall demonstrate how the. variational formalism can be extended to the case where there are unknown hyper-. parameters whose values are to be inferred from the data.. In the variational framework, we seek to maximize a lower bound on the marginal. likelihood. For the Bayesian logistic regression model, the marginal likelihood takes. the form. p(t) =. p(t|w)p(w) dw =. p(tn|w). p(w) dw.. We first note that the conditional distribution for t can be written as. p(t|w) = σ(a)t {1 − σ(a)}1−t. 1 −. 1. t. 1 + e−a. 1 + e−a. e−a. 1 + e−a = eatσ(−a). = eat. 1. 1−t. where a = wTφ.

Evaluation of the exact posterior distribution would require normalization of the left-. hand side of this inequality. Because this is intractable, we work instead with the. right-hand side. Note that the function on the right-hand side cannot be interpreted. as a probability density because it is not normalized. Once it is normalized to give a. variational posterior distribution q(w), however, it no longer represents a bound.. Because the logarithm function is monotonically increasing, the inequality A �. B implies ln A � ln B. This gives a lower bound on the log of the joint distribution. of t and w of the form. ln{p(t|w)p(w)} � ln p(w) +. ln σ(ξn) + wTφntn. − (wTφn + ξn)/2 − λ(ξn)([wTφn]2 − ξ2. n). (10.154). Substituting for the prior p(w), the right-hand side of this inequality becomes, as a. function of w. 1. 2. (w − m0)TS−1. 0 (w − m0). n=1. wTφn(tn − 1/2) − λ(ξn)wT(φnφT. n)w. + const..

This is a quadratic function of w, and so we can obtain the corresponding variational. approximation to the posterior distribution by identifying the linear and quadratic. terms in w, giving a Gaussian variational posterior of the form. where. q(w) = N (w|mN , SN ). mN = SN.

However, the additional flexibility provided by the vari-. ational parameters {ξn} leads to improved accuracy in the approximation (Jaakkola. and Jordan, 2000).. Here we have considered a batch learning context in which all of the training. data is available at once. However, Bayesian methods are intrinsically well suited. to sequential learning in which the data points are processed one at a time and then. discarded. The formulation of this variational approach for the sequential case is. straightforward.. Note that the bound given by (10.149) applies only to the two-class problem and. so this approach does not directly generalize to classification problems with K > 2. classes. An alternative bound for the multiclass case has been explored by Gibbs. (1997).. "
198,10.6.2,Optimizing the variational parameters,"We now have a normalized Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution,. which we shall use shortly to evaluate the predictive distribution for new data points.. First, however, we need to determine the variational parameters {ξn} by maximizing. the lower bound on the marginal likelihood.. To do this, we substitute the inequality (10.152) back into the marginal likeli-. hood to give. ln p(t) = ln. p(t|w)p(w) dw � ln. h(w, ξ)p(w) dw = L(ξ).. (10.159). As with the optimization of the hyperparameter α in the linear regression model of. Section 3.5, there are two approaches to determining the ξn. In the first approach, we. recognize that the function L(ξ) is defined by an integration over w and so we can. view w as a latent variable and invoke the EM algorithm. In the second approach,. we integrate over w analytically and then perform a direct maximization over ξ. Let. us begin by considering the EM approach.. The EM algorithm starts by choosing some initial values for the parameters. In the E step of the EM algorithm,. {ξn}, which we denote collectively by ξold.. N. n=1. 10.6. Variational Logistic Regression. 501. we then use these parameter values to find the posterior distribution over w, which. is given by (10.156). In the M step, we then maximize the expected complete-data. log likelihood which is given by. Q(ξ, ξold) = E [ln h(w, ξ)p(w)]. (10.160). where the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior distribution q(w) evalu-. ated using ξold. Noting that p(w) does not depend on ξ, and substituting for h(w, ξ). we obtain. Q(ξ, ξold) =. ln σ(ξn) − ξn/2 − λ(ξn)(φT. nE[wwT]φn − ξ2. n). + const. (10.161). where ‘const’ denotes terms that are independent of ξ. We now set the derivative with. respect to ξn equal to zero. A few lines of algebra, making use of the definitions of. σ(ξ) and λ(ξ), then gives. 0 = λ(ξn)(φT. n).. nE[wwT]φn − ξ2. (10.162). We now note that λ(ξ) is a monotonic function of ξ for ξ � 0, and that we can. restrict attention to nonnegative values of ξ without loss of generality due to the. symmetry of the bound around ξ = 0. Thus λ(ξ) = 0, and hence we obtain the. following re-estimation equations. (ξnew. n )2 = φT. nE[wwT]φn = φT. n. SN + mN mT. N. φn. (10.163). where we have used (10.156).. Let us summarize the EM algorithm for finding the variational posterior distri-. bution. We first initialize the variational parameters ξold. In the E step, we evaluate. the posterior distribution over w given by (10.156), in which the mean and covari-. ance are defined by (10.157) and (10.158). In the M step, we then use this variational. posterior to compute a new value for ξ given by (10.163). The E and M steps are. repeated until a suitable convergence criterion is satisfied, which in practice typically. requires only a few iterations.. An alternative approach to obtaining re-estimation equations for ξ is to note. that in the integral over w in the definition (10.159) of the lower bound L(ξ), the. integrand has a Gaussian-like form and so the integral can be evaluated analytically.. Having evaluated the integral, we can then differentiate with respect to ξn. It turns. out that this gives rise to exactly the same re-estimation equations as does the EM. approach given by (10.163).. As we have emphasized already, in the application of variational methods it is. useful to be able to evaluate the lower bound L(ξ) given by (10.159). The integration. over w can be performed analytically by noting that p(w) is Gaussian and h(w, ξ). is the exponential of a quadratic function of w. Thus, by completing the square. and making use of the standard result for the normalization coefficient of a Gaussian. distribution, we can obtain a closed form solution which takes the form.

As. each data point arrives, the posterior is updated by making use of the bound (10.151). and then normalized to give an updated posterior distribution.. The predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing over the posterior dis-. tribution, and takes the same form as for the Laplace approximation discussed in. Section 4.5.2. Figure 10.13 shows the variational predictive distributions for a syn-. thetic data set. This example provides interesting insights into the concept of ‘large. margin’, which was discussed in Section 7.1 and which has qualitatively similar be-. haviour to the Bayesian solution.. "
199,10.6.3,Inference of hyperparameters,"So far, we have treated the hyperparameter α in the prior distribution as a known. constant. We now extend the Bayesian logistic regression model to allow the value of. this parameter to be inferred from the data set. This can be achieved by combining. the global and local variational approximations into a single framework, so as to. maintain a lower bound on the marginal likelihood at each stage. Such a combined. approach was adopted by Bishop and Svens´en (2003) in the context of a Bayesian. treatment of the hierarchical mixture of experts model.. (10.166). (10.167). (10.168). 10.6. Variational Logistic Regression. 503. Specifically, we consider once again a simple isotropic Gaussian prior distribu-. tion of the form. p(w|α) = N (w|0, α−1I).. (10.165). Our analysis is readily extended to more general Gaussian priors, for instance if we. wish to associate a different hyperparameter with different subsets of the parame-. ters wj. As usual, we consider a conjugate hyperprior over α given by a gamma. distribution. governed by the constants a0 and b0.. The marginal likelihood for this model now takes the form. p(α) = Gam(α|a0, b0). p(t) =. p(w, α, t) dw dα. where the joint distribution is given by. p(w, α, t) = p(t|w)p(w|α)p(α).. We are now faced with an analytically intractable integration over w and α, which. we shall tackle by using both the local and global variational approaches in the same. model. To begin with, we introduce a variational distribution q(w, α), and then apply. the decomposition (10.2), which in this instance takes the form. (10.169). where the lower bound L(q) and the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(qp) are de-. fined by. ln p(t) = L(q) + KL(qp). L(q) =. q(w, α) ln. dw dα. KL(qp) = −. q(w, α) ln. dw dα.. p(w, α, t). q(w, α). p(w, α|t)). q(w, α). (10.170). (10.171). At this point, the lower bound L(q) is still intractable due to the form of the. likelihood factor p(t|w). We therefore apply the local variational bound to each of. the logistic sigmoid factors as before. This allows us to use the inequality (10.152). and place a lower bound on L(q), which will therefore also be a lower bound on the. log marginal likelihood. ln p(t) � L(q) �. L(q, ξ). q(w, α) ln. h(w, ξ)p(w|α)p(α). q(w, α). dw dα.. (10.172). Next we assume that the variational distribution factorizes between parameters and. hyperparameters so that. q(w, α) = q(w)q(α).. (10.173). N. n=1. n=1. N. n=1. N. 504. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. With this factorization we can appeal to the general result (10.9) to find expressions. for the optimal factors. Consider first the distribution q(w). Discarding terms that. are independent of w, we have. ln q(w) = Eα [ln{h(w, ξ)p(w|α)p(α)}] + const. = ln h(w, ξ) + Eα [ln p(w|α)] + const.. We now substitute for ln h(w, ξ) using (10.153), and for ln p(w|α) using (10.165),. giving. ln q(w) = −. E[α]. 2. wTw +. (tn − 1/2)wTφn − λ(ξn)wTφnφT. nw. + const.. We see that this is a quadratic function of w and so the solution for q(w) will be. Gaussian. Completing the square in the usual way, we obtain. q(w) = N (w|µN , ΣN ). where we have defined. Σ−1. N µN =. (tn − 1/2)φn. Σ−1. N = E[α]I + 2. λ(ξn)φnφT. n.. Similarly, the optimal solution for the factor q(α) is obtained from. ln q(α) = Ew [ln p(w|α)] + ln p(α) + const..

200,10.7,Expectation Propagation,"505. We also need to optimize the variational parameters ξn, and this is also done by. L(q, ξ). Omitting terms that are independent of ξ, and. maximizing the lower bound. integrating over α, we have. L(q, ξ) =. q(w) ln h(w, ξ) dw + const.. (10.180). Note that this has precisely the same form as (10.159), and so we can again appeal. to our earlier result (10.163), which can be obtained by direct optimization of the. marginal likelihood function, leading to re-estimation equations of the form.

The required moments are given by. E [α] = aN. bN. wTw. E. = ΣN + µT. N µN .. (10.182). (10.183). 10.7. Expectation Propagation. We conclude this chapter by discussing an alternative form of deterministic approx-. imate inference, known as expectation propagation or EP (Minka, 2001a; Minka,. 2001b). As with the variational Bayes methods discussed so far, this too is based. on the minimization of a Kullback-Leibler divergence but now of the reverse form,. which gives the approximation rather different properties.. Consider for a moment the problem of minimizing KL(pq) with respect to q(z). when p(z) is a fixed distribution and q(z) is a member of the exponential family and. so, from (2.194), can be written in the form. q(z) = h(z)g(η) exp. ηTu(z). (10.184). As a function of η, the Kullback-Leibler divergence then becomes. KL(pq) = − ln g(η) − ηTEp(z)[u(z)] + const. (10.185). where the constant terms are independent of the natural parameters η. We can mini-. mize KL(pq) within this family of distributions by setting the gradient with respect. to η to zero, giving. (10.186). However, we have already seen in (2.226) that the negative gradient of ln g(η) is. given by the expectation of u(z) under the distribution q(z). Equating these two. results, we obtain. −∇ ln g(η) = Ep(z)[u(z)].. Eq(z)[u(z)] = Ep(z)[u(z)].. (10.187). 1. p(D). i. i. i. 506. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. We see that the optimum solution simply corresponds to matching the expected suf-. ficient statistics. So, for instance, if q(z) is a Gaussian N (z|µ, Σ) then we minimize. the Kullback-Leibler divergence by setting the mean µ of q(z) equal to the mean of. the distribution p(z) and the covariance Σ equal to the covariance of p(z). This is. sometimes called moment matching. An example of this was seen in Figure 10.3(a).. Now let us exploit this result to obtain a practical algorithm for approximate. inference. For many probabilistic models, the joint distribution of data D and hidden. variables (including parameters) θ comprises a product of factors in the form. p(D, θ) =. fi(θ).. (10.188). This would arise, for example, in a model for independent, identically distributed. data in which there is one factor fn(θ) = p(xn|θ) for each data point xn, along. with a factor f0(θ) = p(θ) corresponding to the prior. More generally, it would also. apply to any model defined by a directed probabilistic graph in which each factor is a. conditional distribution corresponding to one of the nodes, or an undirected graph in. which each factor is a clique potential. We are interested in evaluating the posterior. distribution p(θ|D) for the purpose of making predictions, as well as the model. evidence p(D) for the purpose of model comparison. From (10.188) the posterior is. given by. (10.189). fi(θ). p(θ|D) =. and the model evidence is given by. p(D) =. fi(θ) dθ.. (10.190). Here we are considering continuous variables, but the following discussion applies. equally to discrete variables with integrals replaced by summations. We shall sup-. pose that the marginalization over θ, along with the marginalizations with respect to. the posterior distribution required to make predictions, are intractable so that some. form of approximation is required.. Expectation propagation is based on an approximation to the posterior distribu-. tion which is also given by a product of factors. q(θ) =. 1. Z. fi(θ). i. (10.191). fi(θ) in the approximation corresponds to one of the factors. in which each factor. fi(θ) in the true posterior (10.189), and the factor 1/Z is the normalizing constant. needed to ensure that the left-hand side of (10.191) integrates to unity. In order to. fi(θ) in some way,. obtain a practical algorithm, we need to constrain the factors. and in particular we shall assume that they come from the exponential family. The. product of the factors will therefore also be from the exponential family and so can. ''''' 1. q\j(θ) = q(θ). fj(θ). fj(θ). fi(θ). fi(θ). i=j. Z. i. i. 1. p(D). fj(θ). 507. fi(θ). (10.193).

For example, if each of the. is a Gaussian, then the overall approximation q(θ) will also be Gaussian.. Ideally we would like to determine the. fi(θ) by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler. divergence between the true posterior and the approximation given by. KL (pq) = KL. fi(θ). (10.192). Note that this is the reverse form of KL divergence compared with that used in varia-. tional inference. In general, this minimization will be intractable because the KL di-. vergence involves averaging with respect to the true distribution. As a rough approx-. imation, we could instead minimize the KL divergences between the corresponding. pairs fi(θ) and. fi(θ) of factors. This represents a much simpler problem to solve,. and has the advantage that the algorithm is noniterative. However, because each fac-. tor is individually approximated, the product of the factors could well give a poor. approximation.. Expectation propagation makes a much better approximation by optimizing each. factor in turn in the context of all of the remaining factors. It starts by initializing. fi(θ), and then cycles through the factors refining them one at a time.. the factors. This is similar in spirit to the update of factors in the variational Bayes framework. fj(θ). We first remove this. considered earlier. Suppose we wish to refine factor. fi(θ). Conceptually, we will now determine a. factor from the product to give. revised form of the factor. fj(θ) by ensuring that the product. i=j. qnew(θ) ∝. fi(θ). is as close as possible to. i=j. fi(θ) for i = j. This ensures that the. in which we keep fixed all of the factors. approximation is most accurate in the regions of high posterior probability as defined. by the remaining factors. We shall see an example of this effect when we apply EP. fj(θ) from the. to the ‘clutter problem’. To achieve this, we first remove the factor. current approximation to the posterior by defining the unnormalized distribution. Section 10.7.1. Note that we could instead find q\j(θ) from the product of factors i = j, although. in practice division is usually easier. This is now combined with the factor fj(θ) to. give a distribution. 1.

This is easily solved because the approximating distribution qnew(θ) is from the ex-. ponential family, and so we can appeal to the result (10.187), which tells us that the. parameters of qnew(θ) are obtained by matching its expected sufficient statistics to. the corresponding moments of (10.196). We shall assume that this is a tractable oper-. ation. For example, if we choose q(θ) to be a Gaussian distribution N (θ|µ, Σ), then. µ is set equal to the mean of the (unnormalized) distribution fj(θ)q\j(θ), and Σ is. set to its covariance. More generally, it is straightforward to obtain the required ex-. pectations for any member of the exponential family, provided it can be normalized,. because the expected statistics can be related to the derivatives of the normalization. coefficient, as given by (2.226). The EP approximation is illustrated in Figure 10.14.. From (10.193), we see that the revised factor. qnew(θ) and dividing out the remaining factors so that. fj(θ) can be found by taking. fj(θ) = K. qnew(θ). q\j(θ). (10.199). where we have used (10.195). The coefficient K is determined by multiplying both. q\j(θ) = q(θ). fj(θ)q\j(θ) dθ. q(θ) ∝. fi(θ).. fi(θ).. fi(θ). 1. Z. i. i. i. sides of (10.199) by q\i(θ) and integrating to give. K =. 10.7.

The value of K can therefore. be found by matching zeroth-order moments. fj(θ)q\j(θ) dθ =. fj(θ)q\j(θ) dθ.. (10.201). Combining this with (10.197), we then see that K = Zj and so can be found by. evaluating the integral in (10.197).. In practice, several passes are made through the set of factors, revising each. factor in turn. The posterior distribution p(θ|D) is then approximated using (10.191),. and the model evidence p(D) can be approximated by using (10.190) with the factors. fi(θ) replaced by their approximations. fi(θ)..

(c) Evaluate the new posterior by setting the sufficient statistics (moments). of qnew(θ) equal to those of q\j(θ)fj(θ), including evaluation of the. normalization constant. A special case of EP, known as assumed density filtering (ADF) or moment. matching (Maybeck, 1982; Lauritzen, 1992; Boyen and Koller, 1998; Opper and. Winther, 1999), is obtained by initializing all of the approximating factors except. the first to unity and then making one pass through the factors updating each of them. once. Assumed density filtering can be appropriate for on-line learning in which data. points are arriving in a sequence and we need to learn from each data point and then. discard it before considering the next point. However, in a batch setting we have the. opportunity to re-use the data points many times in order to achieve improved ac-. curacy, and it is this idea that is exploited in expectation propagation. Furthermore,. if we apply ADF to batch data, the results will have an undesirable dependence on. the (arbitrary) order in which the data points are considered, which again EP can. overcome.. One disadvantage of expectation propagation is that there is no guarantee that. the iterations will converge. However, for approximations q(θ) in the exponential. family, if the iterations do converge, the resulting solution will be a stationary point. of a particular energy function (Minka, 2001a), although each iteration of EP does. not necessarily decrease the value of this energy function. This is in contrast to. variational Bayes, which iteratively maximizes a lower bound on the log marginal. likelihood, in which each iteration is guaranteed not to decrease the bound. It is. possible to optimize the EP cost function directly, in which case it is guaranteed. to converge, although the resulting algorithms can be slower and more complex to. implement.. Another difference between variational Bayes and EP arises from the form of. KL divergence that is minimized by the two algorithms, because the former mini-. mizes KL(qp) whereas the latter minimizes KL(pq). As we saw in Figure 10.3,. for distributions p(θ) which are multimodal, minimizing KL(pq) can lead to poor. approximations. In particular, if EP is applied to mixtures the results are not sen-. sible because the approximation tries to capture all of the modes of the posterior. distribution. Conversely, in logistic-type models, EP often out-performs both local. variational methods and the Laplace approximation (Kuss and Rasmussen, 2006).. 10.7. Expectation Propagation. 511.

201,10.7.1,Example: The clutter problem,"Following Minka (2001b), we illustrate the EP algorithm using a simple exam-. ple in which the goal is to infer the mean θ of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. over a variable x given a set of observations drawn from that distribution. To make. the problem more interesting, the observations are embedded in background clutter,. which itself is also Gaussian distributed, as illustrated in Figure 10.15. The distribu-. tion of observed values x is therefore a mixture of Gaussians, which we take to be. of the form. p(x|θ) = (1 − w)N (x|θ, I) + wN (x|0, aI). (10.209). where w is the proportion of background clutter and is assumed to be known. The. prior over θ is taken to be Gaussian. p(θ) = N (θ|0, bI). (10.210). and Minka (2001a) chooses the parameter values a = 10, b = 100 and w = 0.5.. The joint distribution of N observations D = {x1, . . . , xN} and θ is given by. p(D, θ) = p(θ). p(xn|θ). n=1. (10.211). and so the posterior distribution comprises a mixture of 2N Gaussians. Thus the. computational cost of solving this problem exactly would grow exponentially with. the size of the data set, and so an exact solution is intractable for moderately large. N.. To apply EP to the clutter problem, we first identify the factors f0(θ) = p(θ). and fn(θ) = p(xn|θ). Next we select an approximating distribution from the expo-. nential family, and for this example it is convenient to choose a spherical Gaussian. q(θ) = N (θ|m, vI).. (10.212). 512. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. The factor approximations will therefore take the form of exponential-quadratic. functions of the form. fn(θ) = snN (θ|mn, vnI). (10.213). where n = 1, . . . , N, and we set. f0(θ) equal to the prior p(θ). Note that the use of. N (θ|·,·) does not imply that the right-hand side is a well-defined Gaussian density. (in fact, as we shall see, the variance parameter vn can be negative) but is simply a. fn(θ), for n = 1, . . . , N, can. convenient shorthand notation. The approximations. be initialized to unity, corresponding to sn = (2πvn)D/2, vn → ∞ and mn = 0,. where D is the dimensionality of x and hence of θ. The initial q(θ), defined by. (10.191), is therefore equal to the prior.. We then iteratively refine the factors by taking one factor fn(θ) at a time and. applying (10.205), (10.206), and (10.207). Note that we do not need to revise the. term f0(θ) because an EP update will leave this term unchanged. Here we state the. results and leave the reader to fill in the details.. First we remove the current estimate. fn(θ) from q(θ) by division using (10.205). to give q\n(θ), which has mean and inverse variance given by. m\n = m + v\nv−1. n (m − mn). (v\n)−1 = v−1 − v−1. n .. Next we evaluate the normalization constant Zn using (10.206) to give. Zn = (1 − w)N (xn|m\n, (v\n + 1)I) + wN (xn|0, aI).. Similarly, we compute the mean and variance of qnew(θ) by finding the mean and. variance of q\n(θ)fn(θ) to give. Exercise 10.37. Exercise 10.38.

202,10.7.2,Expectation propagation on graphs,"So far in our general discussion of EP, we have allowed the factors fi(θ) in the. distribution p(θ) to be functions of all of the components of θ, and similarly for the. f(θ) in the approximating distribution q(θ). We now consider. approximating factors. situations in which the factors depend only on subsets of the variables. Such restric-. tions can be conveniently expressed using the framework of probabilistic graphical. models, as discussed in Chapter 8. Here we use a factor graph representation because. this encompasses both directed and undirected graphs.. 10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE. 514. 100. r. o. r. r. E. 10−5.

Figure 10.17 Comparison of expectation propagation, variational inference, and the Laplace approximation on. the clutter problem. The left-hand plot shows the error in the predicted posterior mean versus the number of. floating point operations, and the right-hand plot shows the corresponding results for the model evidence.. Section 8.4.4. We shall focus on the case in which the approximating distribution is fully fac-. torized, and we shall show that in this case expectation propagation reduces to loopy. belief propagation (Minka, 2001a). To start with, we show this in the context of a. simple example, and then we shall explore the general case.. First of all, recall from (10.17) that if we minimize the Kullback-Leibler diver-. gence KL(pq) with respect to a factorized distribution q, then the optimal solution. for each factor is simply the corresponding marginal of p.. Now consider the factor graph shown on the left in Figure 10.18, which was. introduced earlier in the context of the sum-product algorithm. The joint distribution. is given by. p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x2, x3)fc(x2, x4).. We seek an approximation q(x) that has the same factorization, so that. (10.225). (10.226). q(x) ∝. fa(x1, x2). fb(x2, x3). fc(x2, x4).. Note that normalization constants have been omitted, and these can be re-instated at. the end by local normalization, as is generally done in belief propagation. Now sup-. pose we restrict attention to approximations in which the factors themselves factorize. with respect to the individual variables so that. q(x) ∝. fa1(x1). fa2(x2). fb2(x2). fb3(x3). fc2(x2). fc4(x4). (10.227). which corresponds to the factor graph shown on the right in Figure 10.18. Because. the individual factors are factorized, the overall distribution q(x) is itself fully fac-. torized.. Now we apply the EP algorithm using the fully factorized approximation. Sup-. pose that we have initialized all of the factors and that we choose to refine factor. x3. 10.7.

On. the right is the corresponding factorized approximation.. fb(x2, x3) =. distribution to give. fb2(x2). fb3(x3). We first remove this factor from the approximating. q\b(x) =. fa1(x1). fa2(x2). fc2(x2). fc4(x4). (10.228). and we then multiply this by the exact factor fb(x2, x3) to give. fa1(x1). fa2(x2). p(x) = q\b(x)fb(x2, x3) =. (10.229). pqnew).. We now find qnew(x) by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(. The result, as noted above, is that qnew(z) comprises the product of factors, one for. each variable xi, in which each factor is given by the corresponding marginal of. p(x). These four marginals are given by. fc4(x4)fb(x2, x3).. fc2(x2). p(x1) ∝. p(x2) ∝. p(x3) ∝. p(x4) ∝. fa1(x1). fa2(x2). x2. fc4(x4). fc2(x2). fb(x2, x3). fb(x2, x3). fc2(x2). x3. fa2(x2). and qnew(x) is obtained by multiplying these marginals together. We see that the. fb(x2, x3) are those that involve. only factors in q(x) that change when we update. fb(x2, x3) =. the variables in fb namely x2 and x3. To obtain the refined factor. fb2(x2). fb3(x3) we simply divide qnew(x) by q\b(x), which gives. fb2(x2) ∝. fb(x2, x3). fb3(x3) ∝. x2. fb(x2, x3). fa2(x2). fc2(x2). (10.235). (10.230). (10.231).

These are precisely the messages obtained using belief propagation in which mes-. sages from variable nodes to factor nodes have been folded into the messages from. fb2(x2) corresponds to the message. factor nodes to variable nodes. In particular,. µfb→x2(x2) sent by factor node fb to variable node x2 and is given by (8.81). Simi-. fa2(x2) corre-. larly, if we substitute (8.78) into (8.79), we obtain (10.235) in which. sponds to µfa→x2(x2) and. fc2(x2) corresponds to µfc→x2(x2), giving the message. fb3(x3) which corresponds to µfb→x3(x3).. This result differs slightly from standard belief propagation in that messages are. passed in both directions at the same time. We can easily modify the EP procedure. to give the standard form of the sum-product algorithm by updating just one of the. fb2(x2) is unchanged. factors at a time, for instance if we refine only. fb3(x3) is again given by (10.235). If. by definition, while the refined version of. we are refining only one term at a time, then we can choose the order in which the. refinements are done as we wish. In particular, for a tree-structured graph we can. follow a two-pass update scheme, corresponding to the standard belief propagation. schedule, which will result in exact inference of the variable and factor marginals.. The initialization of the approximation factors in this case is unimportant.. fb3(x3), then. Now let us consider a general factor graph corresponding to the distribution. p(θ) =. fi(θi). (10.236). where θi represents the subset of variables associated with factor fi. We approximate. this using a fully factorized distribution of the form. q(θ) ∝. fik(θk). (10.237). where θk corresponds to an individual variable node. Suppose that we wish to refine. fjl(θl) keeping all other terms fixed. We first remove the term. the particular term. fj(θj) from q(θ) to give. q\j(θ) ∝. fik(θk). (10.238). fjl(θl),. and then multiply by the exact factor fj(θj). To determine the refined term. we need only consider the functional dependence on θl, and so we simply find the. corresponding marginal of. q\j(θ)fj(θj).. (10.239). Up to a multiplicative constant, this involves taking the marginal of fj(θj) multiplied. by any terms from q\j(θ) that are functions of any of the variables in θj. Terms that. fi(θi) for i = j will cancel between numerator and. correspond to other factors. denominator when we subsequently divide by q\j(θ). We therefore obtain. fjl(θl) ∝. fj(θj). fkm(θm).. (10.240). θm=l∈θj. k. m=l. Exercises. 517. We recognize this as the sum-product rule in the form in which messages from vari-. able nodes to factor nodes have been eliminated, as illustrated by the example shown. fjm(θm) corresponds to the message µfj→θm(θm),. in Figure 8.50. The quantity. which factor node j sends to variable node m, and the product over k in (10.240). is over all factors that depend on the variables θm that have variables (other than. variable θl) in common with factor fj(θj). In other words, to compute the outgoing. message from a factor node, we take the product of all the incoming messages from. other factor nodes, multiply by the local factor, and then marginalize.. Thus, the sum-product algorithm arises as a special case of expectation propa-. gation if we use an approximating distribution that is fully factorized. This suggests. that more flexible approximating distributions, corresponding to partially discon-. nected graphs, could be used to achieve higher accuracy. Another generalization is. to group factors fi(θi) together into sets and to refine all the factors in a set together. at each iteration. Both of these approaches can lead to improvements in accuracy. (Minka, 2001b). In general, the problem of choosing the best combination of group-. ing and disconnection is an open research issue.. We have seen that variational message passing and expectation propagation op-. timize two different forms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Minka (2005) has. shown that a broad range of message passing algorithms can be derived from a com-. mon framework involving minimization of members of the alpha family of diver-. gences, given by (10.19). These include variational message passing, loopy belief. propagation, and expectation propagation, as well as a range of other algorithms,. which we do not have space to discuss here, such as tree-reweighted message pass-. ing (Wainwright et al., 2005), fractional belief propagation (Wiegerinck and Heskes,. 2003), and power EP (Minka, 2004)..

203,11,Sampling Methods,"For most probabilistic models of practical interest, exact inference is intractable, and. so we have to resort to some form of approximation. In Chapter 10, we discussed. inference algorithms based on deterministic approximations, which include methods. such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation. Here we consider approxi-. mate inference methods based on numerical sampling, also known as Monte Carlo. techniques.. Although for some applications the posterior distribution over unobserved vari-. ables will be of direct interest in itself, for most situations the posterior distribution. is required primarily for the purpose of evaluating expectations, for example in order. to make predictions. The fundamental problem that we therefore wish to address in. this chapter involves finding the expectation of some function f(z) with respect to a. probability distribution p(z). Here, the components of z might comprise discrete or. continuous variables or some combination of the two. Thus in the case of continuous. 523. l=1. L. f(z). z. (11.1). (11.2). 524. 11.

E[f] =. f(z)p(z) dz. where the integral is replaced by summation in the case of discrete variables. This. is illustrated schematically for a single continuous variable in Figure 11.1. We shall. suppose that such expectations are too complex to be evaluated exactly using analyt-. ical techniques.. The general idea behind sampling methods is to obtain a set of samples z(l). (where l = 1, . . . , L) drawn independently from the distribution p(z). This allows. the expectation (11.1) to be approximated by a finite sum. f =. 1. L. f(z(l)).. Exercise 11.1. As long as the samples z(l) are drawn from the distribution p(z), then E[. and so the estimator. by. f] = E[f]. f has the correct mean. The variance of the estimator is given. var[. f] =. E. (f − E[f])2. (11.3). 1. L. is the variance of the function f(z) under the distribution p(z). It is worth emphasiz-. ing that the accuracy of the estimator therefore does not depend on the dimension-. ality of z, and that, in principle, high accuracy may be achievable with a relatively. small number of samples z(l). In practice, ten or twenty independent samples may. suffice to estimate an expectation to sufficient accuracy.. The problem, however, is that the samples {z(l)} might not be independent, and. so the effective sample size might be much smaller than the apparent sample size.. Also, referring back to Figure 11.1, we note that if f(z) is small in regions where. p(z) is large, and vice versa, then the expectation may be dominated by regions. of small probability, implying that relatively large sample sizes will be required to. achieve sufficient accuracy.. For many models, the joint distribution p(z) is conveniently specified in terms. of a graphical model. In the case of a directed graph with no observed variables, it is. M. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. 525. straightforward to sample from the joint distribution (assuming that it is possible to. sample from the conditional distributions at each node) using the following ances-. tral sampling approach, discussed briefly in Section 8.1.2. The joint distribution is. specified by. p(z) =. p(zi|pai). i=1. (11.4). where zi are the set of variables associated with node i, and pai denotes the set of. variables associated with the parents of node i. To obtain a sample from the joint. distribution, we make one pass through the set of variables in the order z1, . . . , zM. sampling from the conditional distributions p(zi|pai). This is always possible be-. cause at each step all of the parent values will have been instantiated. After one pass. through the graph, we will have obtained a sample from the joint distribution.. Now consider the case of a directed graph in which some of the nodes are in-. stantiated with observed values. We can in principle extend the above procedure, at. least in the case of nodes representing discrete variables, to give the following logic. sampling approach (Henrion, 1988), which can be seen as a special case of impor-. tance sampling discussed in Section 11.1.4. At each step, when a sampled value is. obtained for a variable zi whose value is observed, the sampled value is compared. to the observed value, and if they agree then the sample value is retained and the al-. gorithm proceeds to the next variable in turn. However, if the sampled value and the. observed value disagree, then the whole sample so far is discarded and the algorithm. starts again with the first node in the graph. This algorithm samples correctly from. the posterior distribution because it corresponds simply to drawing samples from the. joint distribution of hidden variables and data variables and then discarding those. samples that disagree with the observed data (with the slight saving of not continu-. ing with the sampling from the joint distribution as soon as one contradictory value is. observed). However, the overall probability of accepting a sample from the posterior. decreases rapidly as the number of observed variables increases and as the number. of states that those variables can take increases, and so this approach is rarely used. in practice.. In the case of probability distributions defined by an undirected graph, there is. no one-pass sampling strategy that will sample even from the prior distribution with. no observed variables. Instead, computationally more expensive techniques must be. employed, such as Gibbs sampling, which is discussed in Section 11.3.. As well as sampling from conditional distributions, we may also require samples. from a marginal distribution. If we already have a strategy for sampling from a joint. distribution p(u, v), then it is straightforward to obtain samples from the marginal. distribution p(u) simply by ignoring the values for v in each sample.. There are numerous texts dealing with Monte Carlo methods. Those of partic-. ular interest from the statistical inference perspective include Chen et al. (2001),. Gamerman (1997), Gilks et al. (1996), Liu (2001), Neal (1996), and Robert and. Casella (1999). Also there are review articles by Besag et al. (1995), Brooks (1998),. Diaconis and Saloff-Coste (1998), Jerrum and Sinclair (1996), Neal (1993), Tierney. (1994), and Andrieu et al. (2003) that provide additional information on sampling.  dz. dy. y. "
204,11.1,Basic Sampling Algorithms,"In this section, we consider some simple strategies for generating random samples. from a given distribution. Because the samples will be generated by a computer. algorithm they will in fact be pseudo-random numbers, that is, they will be deter-. ministically calculated, but must nevertheless pass appropriate tests for randomness.. Generating such numbers raises several subtleties (Press et al., 1992) that lie outside. the scope of this book. Here we shall assume that an algorithm has been provided. that generates pseudo-random numbers distributed uniformly over (0, 1), and indeed. most software environments have such a facility built in.. "
205,11.1.1,Standard distributions,"We first consider how to generate random numbers from simple nonuniform dis-. tributions, assuming that we already have available a source of uniformly distributed. random numbers. Suppose that z is uniformly distributed over the interval (0, 1),. and that we transform the values of z using some function f(·) so that y = f(z).. The distribution of y will be governed by. where, in this case, p(z) = 1. Our goal is to choose the function f(z) such that the. resulting values of y have some specific desired distribution p(y). Integrating (11.5). we obtain. p(y) = p(z). z = h(y) ≡. p(. y) d. y. (11.5). (11.6). 526. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. methods for statistical inference..

Thus, y = h−1(z), and so we have to. transform the uniformly distributed random numbers using a function which is the. inverse of the indefinite integral of the desired distribution. This is illustrated in. Figure 11.2.. Consider for example the exponential distribution. p(y) = λ exp(−λy). (11.7). where 0 � y < ∞. In this case the lower limit of the integral in (11.6) is 0, and so. h(y) = 1 − exp(−λy). Thus, if we transform our uniformly distributed variable z. using y = −λ−1 ln(1 − z), then y will have an exponential distribution..  ∂(z1, . . . , zM ). y. ∂(y1, . . . , yM ). p(y). 11.1.

The generalization to multiple variables is straightforward and involves the Ja-. cobian of the change of variables, so that. p(y1, . . . , yM ) = p(z1, . . . , zM ). (11.9). As a final example of the transformation method we consider the Box-Muller. method for generating samples from a Gaussian distribution. First, suppose we gen-. erate pairs of uniformly distributed random numbers z1, z2 ∈ (−1, 1), which we can. do by transforming a variable distributed uniformly over (0, 1) using z → 2z − 1.. 2 � 1. This leads to a uniform. Next we discard each pair unless it satisfies z2. distribution of points inside the unit circle with p(z1, z2) = 1/π, as illustrated in. Figure 11.3.

If y has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance, then σy + µ. will have a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ2. To generate vector-. valued variables having a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean µ and co-. variance Σ, we can make use of the Cholesky decomposition, which takes the form. Σ = LLT (Press et al., 1992). Then, if z is a vector valued random variable whose. components are independent and Gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit vari-. ance, then y = µ + Lz will have mean µ and covariance Σ.. Obviously, the transformation technique depends for its success on the ability. to calculate and then invert the indefinite integral of the required distribution. Such. operations will only be feasible for a limited number of simple distributions, and so. we must turn to alternative approaches in search of a more general strategy. Here. we consider two techniques called rejection sampling and importance sampling. Al-. though mainly limited to univariate distributions and thus not directly applicable to. complex problems in many dimensions, they do form important components in more. general strategies.. "
206,11.1.2,Rejection sampling,"The rejection sampling framework allows us to sample from relatively complex. distributions, subject to certain constraints. We begin by considering univariate dis-. tributions and discuss the extension to multiple dimensions subsequently.. Suppose we wish to sample from a distribution p(z) that is not one of the simple,. standard distributions considered so far, and that sampling directly from p(z) is dif-. ficult. Furthermore suppose, as is often the case, that we are easily able to evaluate. p(z) for any given value of z, up to some normalizing constant Z, so that. p(z) =. p(z). (11.13). where. p(z) can readily be evaluated, but Zp is unknown.. In order to apply rejection sampling, we need some simpler distribution q(z),. sometimes called a proposal distribution, from which we can readily draw samples.. e. e. z. 11.1. Basic Sampling Algorithms. 529. Figure 11.4 In the rejection sampling method,. samples are drawn from a sim-. ple distribution q(z) and rejected. if they fall. in the grey area be-. tween the unnormalized distribu-. tion. p(z) and the scaled distribu-. tion kq(z). The resulting samples. are distributed according to p(z),. which is the normalized version of. p(z).. kq(z). ˜p(z). kq(z0). u0. z0. Exercise 11.6. We next introduce a constant k whose value is chosen such that kq(z) �. p(z) for. all values of z. The function kq(z) is called the comparison function and is illus-. trated for a univariate distribution in Figure 11.4. Each step of the rejection sampler. involves generating two random numbers. First, we generate a number z0 from the. distribution q(z). Next, we generate a number u0 from the uniform distribution over. [0, kq(z0)]. This pair of random numbers has uniform distribution under the curve. p(z0) then the sample is rejected, otherwise. of the function kq(z). Finally, if u0 >. u0 is retained. Thus the pair is rejected if it lies in the grey shaded region in Fig-. p(z),. ure 11.4. The remaining pairs then have uniform distribution under the curve of. and hence the corresponding z values are distributed according to p(z), as desired.. The original values of z are generated from the distribution q(z), and these sam-. p(z)/kq(z), and so the probability that a. ples are then accepted with probability. sample will be accepted is given by. p(accept) =. 1. k. p(z)/kq(z)} q(z) dz. p(z) dz.. (11.14). Thus the fraction of points that are rejected by this method depends on the ratio of. p(z) to the area under the curve kq(z).. the area under the unnormalized distribution. We therefore see that the constant k should be as small as possible subject to the. limitation that kq(z) must be nowhere less than. p(z).. As an illustration of the use of rejection sampling, consider the task of sampling. from the gamma distribution. Gam(z|a, b) = baza−1 exp(−bz). Γ(a). (11.15). which, for a > 1, has a bell-shaped form, as shown in Figure 11.5. A suitable. proposal distribution is therefore the Cauchy (11.8) because this too is bell-shaped. and because we can use the transformation method, discussed earlier, to sample from. it. We need to generalize the Cauchy slightly to ensure that it nowhere has a smaller. value than the gamma distribution. This can be achieved by transforming a uniform. random variable y using z = b tan y + c, which gives random numbers distributed. according to.. Exercise 11.7. 10. 20. 30. z. (11.16). q(z) =. k. 1 + (z − c)2/b2 .. The minimum reject rate is obtained by setting c = a − 1, b2 = 2a − 1 and choos-. ing the constant k to be as small as possible while still satisfying the requirement. kq(z) �. p(z). The resulting comparison function is also illustrated in Figure 11.5.. "
207,11.1.3,Adaptive rejection sampling,"In many instances where we might wish to apply rejection sampling, it proves. difficult to determine a suitable analytic form for the envelope distribution q(z). An. alternative approach is to construct the envelope function on the fly based on mea-. sured values of the distribution p(z) (Gilks and Wild, 1992). Construction of an. envelope function is particularly straightforward for cases in which p(z) is log con-. cave, in other words when ln p(z) has derivatives that are nonincreasing functions. of z. The construction of a suitable envelope function is illustrated graphically in. Figure 11.6.. The function ln p(z) and its gradient are evaluated at some initial set of grid. points, and the intersections of the resulting tangent lines are used to construct the. envelope function. Next a sample value is drawn from the envelope distribution.. This is straightforward because the log of the envelope distribution is a succession. Exercise 11.9. Figure 11.6 In the case of distributions that are. log concave, an envelope function. for use in rejection sampling can be. constructed using the tangent lines. computed at a set of grid points. If a. sample point is rejected, it is added. to the set of grid points and used to. refine the envelope distribution.. ln p(z). z1. z2. z3. z. 530. 11. SAMPLING METHODS.

(11.17). Once a sample has been drawn, the usual rejection criterion can be applied. If the. sample is accepted, then it will be a draw from the desired distribution. If, however,. the sample is rejected, then it is incorporated into the set of grid points, a new tangent. line is computed, and the envelope function is thereby refined. As the number of. grid points increases, so the envelope function becomes a better approximation of. the desired distribution p(z) and the probability of rejection decreases.. A variant of the algorithm exists that avoids the evaluation of derivatives (Gilks,. 1992). The adaptive rejection sampling framework can also be extended to distri-. butions that are not log concave, simply by following each rejection sampling step. with a Metropolis-Hastings step (to be discussed in Section 11.2.2), giving rise to. adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (Gilks et al., 1995).. Clearly for rejection sampling to be of practical value, we require that the com-. parison function be close to the required distribution so that the rate of rejection is. kept to a minimum. Now let us examine what happens when we try to use rejection. sampling in spaces of high dimensionality. Consider, for the sake of illustration,. a somewhat artificial problem in which we wish to sample from a zero-mean mul-. pI, where I is the unit matrix, by. tivariate Gaussian distribution with covariance σ2. rejection sampling from a proposal distribution that is itself a zero-mean Gaussian. p in order that. distribution having covariance σ2. there exists a k such that kq(z) � p(z). In D-dimensions the optimum value of k. is given by k = (σq/σp)D, as illustrated for D = 1 in Figure 11.7. The acceptance. rate will be the ratio of volumes under p(z) and kq(z), which, because both distribu-. tions are normalized, is just 1/k. Thus the acceptance rate diminishes exponentially. with dimensionality. Even if σq exceeds σp by just one percent, for D = 1, 000 the. acceptance ratio will be approximately 1/20, 000. In this illustrative example the. comparison function is close to the required distribution. For more practical exam-. ples, where the desired distribution may be multimodal and sharply peaked, it will. be extremely difficult to find a good proposal distribution and comparison function.. qI. Obviously, we must have σ2. q � σ2. 532. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. Figure 11.8 Importance sampling addresses the prob-. lem of evaluating the expectation of a func-. tion f (z) with respect to a distribution p(z). from which it is difficult to draw samples di-.

Furthermore, the exponential decrease of acceptance rate with dimensionality is a. generic feature of rejection sampling. Although rejection can be a useful technique. in one or two dimensions it is unsuited to problems of high dimensionality. It can,. however, play a role as a subroutine in more sophisticated algorithms for sampling. in high dimensional spaces.. "
208,11.1.4,Importance sampling,"One of the principal reasons for wishing to sample from complicated probability. distributions is to be able to evaluate expectations of the form (11.1). The technique. of importance sampling provides a framework for approximating expectations di-. rectly but does not itself provide a mechanism for drawing samples from distribution. p(z).. The finite sum approximation to the expectation, given by (11.2), depends on. being able to draw samples from the distribution p(z). Suppose, however, that it is. impractical to sample directly from p(z) but that we can evaluate p(z) easily for any. given value of z. One simplistic strategy for evaluating expectations would be to. discretize z-space into a uniform grid and to evaluate the integrand as a sum of the. form. E[f] . l=1. p(z(l))f(z(l)).. (11.18). An obvious problem with this approach is that the number of terms in the summation. grows exponentially with the dimensionality of z. Furthermore, as we have already. noted, the kinds of probability distributions of interest will often have much of their. mass confined to relatively small regions of z space and so uniform sampling will be. very inefficient because in high-dimensional problems, only a very small proportion. of the samples will make a significant contribution to the sum. We would really like. to choose the sample points to fall in regions where p(z) is large, or ideally where. the product p(z)f(z) is large.. As in the case of rejection sampling, importance sampling is based on the use. of a proposal distribution q(z) from which it is easy to draw samples, as illustrated. in Figure 11.8. We can then express the expectation in the form of a finite sum over. Zq. Zp. l=1. L. 1. L. rl. f(z). 1. L. l=1. l=1. l=1. L. L. L. 1. Zq. 1. L. p(z). p(z). E[f] =. f(z)p(z) dz. = Zq.

The quantities rl = p(z(l))/q(z(l)) are known as importance weights, and they cor-. rect the bias introduced by sampling from the wrong distribution. Note that, unlike. rejection sampling, all of the samples generated are retained.. It will often be the case that the distribution p(z) can only be evaluated up to a. normalization constant, so that p(z) =. p(z) can be evaluated easily,. whereas Zp is unknown. Similarly, we may wish to use an importance sampling. distribution q(z) =. q(z)/Zq, which has the same property. We then have. p(z)/Zp where. rl =. p(z(l))/. where. Zp/Zq with the result. q(z(l)).

As with rejection sampling, the success of the importance sampling approach. depends crucially on how well the sampling distribution q(z) matches the desired. 533. (11.19). (11.20). (11.21). (11.22). (11.23). 534. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. distribution p(z). If, as is often the case, p(z)f(z) is strongly varying and has a sig-. nificant proportion of its mass concentrated over relatively small regions of z space,. then the set of importance weights {rl} may be dominated by a few weights hav-. ing large values, with the remaining weights being relatively insignificant. Thus the. effective sample size can be much smaller than the apparent sample size L. The prob-. lem is even more severe if none of the samples falls in the regions where p(z)f(z). is large. In that case, the apparent variances of rl and rlf(z(l)) may be small even. though the estimate of the expectation may be severely wrong. Hence a major draw-. back of the importance sampling method is the potential to produce results that are. arbitrarily in error and with no diagnostic indication. This also highlights a key re-. quirement for the sampling distribution q(z), namely that it should not be small or. zero in regions where p(z) may be significant.. For distributions defined in terms of a graphical model, we can apply the impor-. tance sampling technique in various ways. For discrete variables, a simple approach. is called uniform sampling. The joint distribution for a directed graph is defined. by (11.4). Each sample from the joint distribution is obtained by first setting those. variables zi that are in the evidence set equal to their observed values. Each of the. remaining variables is then sampled independently from a uniform distribution over. the space of possible instantiations. To determine the corresponding weight associ-. q(z) is uniform over. ated with a sample z(l), we note that the sampling distribution. p(z), where x denotes the subset of. the possible choices for z, and that. variables that are observed, and the equality follows from the fact that every sample. z that is generated is necessarily consistent with the evidence. Thus the weights rl. are simply proportional to p(z). Note that the variables can be sampled in any order.. This approach can yield poor results if the posterior distribution is far from uniform,. as is often the case in practice.. p(z|x) =. An improvement on this approach is called likelihood weighted sampling (Fung. and Chang, 1990; Shachter and Peot, 1990) and is based on ancestral sampling of. the variables. For each variable in turn, if that variable is in the evidence set, then it. is just set to its instantiated value. If it is not in the evidence set, then it is sampled. from the conditional distribution p(zi|pai) in which the conditioning variables are. set to their currently sampled values. The weighting associated with the resulting. sample z is then given by. r(z) =. p(zi|pai). p(zi|pai). zi∈e. zi∈e. p(zi|pai). 1. zi∈e. p(zi|pai).. (11.24). This method can be further extended using self-importance sampling (Shachter and. Peot, 1990) in which the importance sampling distribution is continually updated to. reflect the current estimated posterior distribution.. "
209,11.1.5,Sampling-importance-resampling,"The rejection sampling method discussed in Section 11.1.2 depends in part for. its success on the determination of a suitable value for the constant k. For many. pairs of distributions p(z) and q(z), it will be impractical to determine a suitable. 11.1. Basic Sampling Algorithms. 535. value for k in that any value that is sufficiently large to guarantee a bound on the. desired distribution will lead to impractically small acceptance rates.. As in the case of rejection sampling, the sampling-importance-resampling (SIR). approach also makes use of a sampling distribution q(z) but avoids having to de-. termine the constant k. There are two stages to the scheme.. In the first stage,. L samples z(1), . . . , z(L) are drawn from q(z). Then in the second stage, weights. w1, . . . , wL are constructed using (11.23). Finally, a second set of L samples is. drawn from the discrete distribution (z(1), . . . , z(L)) with probabilities given by the. weights (w1, . . . , wL).. The resulting L samples are only approximately distributed according to p(z),. but the distribution becomes correct in the limit L → ∞. To see this, consider the. univariate case, and note that the cumulative distribution of the resampled values is. given by. p(z � a) =. wl. l:z(l)�a. l I(z(l) � a). p(z(l))/q(z(l)). p(z(l))/q(z(l)). l. (11.25). where I(.) is the indicator function (which equals 1 if its argument is true and 0. otherwise). Taking the limit L → ∞, and assuming suitable regularity of the dis-. tributions, we can replace the sums by integrals weighted according to the original. sampling distribution q(z).

Again, we see that the normal-. ization of p(z) is not required.. For a finite value of L, and a given initial sample set, the resampled values will. only approximately be drawn from the desired distribution. As with rejection sam-. pling, the approximation improves as the sampling distribution q(z) gets closer to. the desired distribution p(z). When q(z) = p(z), the initial samples (z(1), . . . , z(L)). have the desired distribution, and the weights wn = 1/L so that the resampled values. also have the desired distribution.. If moments with respect to the distribution p(z) are required, then they can be. L. l=1. L. 536. 11.

210,11.1.6,Sampling and the EM algorithm,"In addition to providing a mechanism for direct implementation of the Bayesian. framework, Monte Carlo methods can also play a role in the frequentist paradigm,. for example to find maximum likelihood solutions. In particular, sampling methods. can be used to approximate the E step of the EM algorithm for models in which the. E step cannot be performed analytically. Consider a model with hidden variables. Z, visible (observed) variables X, and parameters θ. The function that is optimized. with respect to θ in the M step is the expected complete-data log likelihood, given. by. Q(θ, θold) =. p(Z|X, θold) ln p(Z, X|θ) dZ.. (11.28). We can use sampling methods to approximate this integral by a finite sum over sam-. ples {Z(l)}, which are drawn from the current estimate for the posterior distribution. p(Z|X, θold), so that. Q(θ, θold) . 1. L. ln p(Z(l), X|θ).. l=1. (11.29). The Q function is then optimized in the usual way in the M step. This procedure is. called the Monte Carlo EM algorithm.. It is straightforward to extend this to the problem of finding the mode of the. posterior distribution over θ (the MAP estimate) when a prior distribution p(θ) has. been defined, simply by adding ln p(θ) to the function Q(θ, θold) before performing. the M step.. A particular instance of the Monte Carlo EM algorithm, called stochastic EM,. arises if we consider a finite mixture model, and draw just one sample at each E step.. Here the latent variable Z characterizes which of the K components of the mixture. is responsible for generating each data point. In the E step, a sample of Z is taken. from the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θold) where X is the data set. This effectively. makes a hard assignment of each data point to one of the components in the mixture.. In the M step, this sampled approximation to the posterior distribution is used to. update the model parameters in the usual way.. L. "
211,11.2,Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"537. Now suppose we move from a maximum likelihood approach to a full Bayesian. treatment in which we wish to sample from the posterior distribution over the param-. eter vector θ. In principle, we would like to draw samples from the joint posterior. p(θ, Z|X), but we shall suppose that this is computationally difficult. Suppose fur-. ther that it is relatively straightforward to sample from the complete-data parameter. posterior p(θ|Z, X). This inspires the data augmentation algorithm, which alter-. nates between two steps known as the I-step (imputation step, analogous to an E. step) and the P-step (posterior step, analogous to an M step).. IP Algorithm. I-step. We wish to sample from p(Z|X) but we cannot do this directly. We. therefore note the relation. p(Z|X) =. p(Z|θ, X)p(θ|X) dθ. (11.30). and hence for l = 1, . . . , L we first draw a sample θ(l) from the current esti-. mate for p(θ|X), and then use this to draw a sample Z(l) from p(Z|θ(l), X).. P-step. Given the relation. p(θ|X) =. p(θ|Z, X)p(Z|X) dZ. (11.31). we use the samples {Z(l)} obtained from the I-step to compute a revised. estimate of the posterior distribution over θ given by. p(θ|X) . 1. L. p(θ|Z(l), X).. l=1. (11.32). By assumption, it will be feasible to sample from this approximation in the. I-step.. Note that we are making a (somewhat artificial) distinction between parameters θ. and hidden variables Z. From now on, we blur this distinction and focus simply on. the problem of drawing samples from a given posterior distribution.. 11.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo. In the previous section, we discussed the rejection sampling and importance sam-. pling strategies for evaluating expectations of functions, and we saw that they suffer. from severe limitations particularly in spaces of high dimensionality. We therefore. turn in this section to a very general and powerful framework called Markov chain. Monte Carlo (MCMC), which allows sampling from a large class of distributions,. 538. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. Section 11.2.1. A(z, z(τ )) = min. 1,. (11.33). p(z). p(z(τ )). and which scales well with the dimensionality of the sample space. Markov chain. Monte Carlo methods have their origins in physics (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949),. and it was only towards the end of the 1980s that they started to have a significant. impact in the field of statistics.. As with rejection and importance sampling, we again sample from a proposal. distribution. This time, however, we maintain a record of the current state z(τ ), and. the proposal distribution q(z|z(τ )) depends on this current state, and so the sequence. of samples z(1), z(2), . . . forms a Markov chain. Again, if we write p(z) =. p(z)/Zp,. p(z) can readily be evaluated for any given value of z, although. we will assume that. the value of Zp may be unknown. The proposal distribution itself is chosen to be. sufficiently simple that it is straightforward to draw samples from it directly. At. each cycle of the algorithm, we generate a candidate sample z from the proposal. distribution and then accept the sample according to an appropriate criterion.. In the basic Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953), we assume that the. proposal distribution is symmetric, that is q(zA|zB) = q(zB|zA) for all values of. zA and zB. The candidate sample is then accepted with probability. This can be achieved by choosing a random number u with uniform distribution over. the unit interval (0, 1) and then accepting the sample if A(z, z(τ )) > u. Note that. if the step from z(τ ) to z causes an increase in the value of p(z), then the candidate. point is certain to be kept.. If the candidate sample is accepted, then z(τ +1) = z, otherwise the candidate. point z is discarded, z(τ +1) is set to z(τ ) and another candidate sample is drawn. from the distribution q(z|z(τ +1)). This is in contrast to rejection sampling, where re-. jected samples are simply discarded. In the Metropolis algorithm when a candidate. point is rejected, the previous sample is included instead in the final list of samples,. leading to multiple copies of samples. Of course, in a practical implementation,. only a single copy of each retained sample would be kept, along with an integer. weighting factor recording how many times that state appears. As we shall see, as. long as q(zA|zB) is positive for any values of zA and zB (this is a sufficient but. not necessary condition), the distribution of z(τ ) tends to p(z) as τ → ∞. It should. be emphasized, however, that the sequence z(1), z(2), . . . is not a set of independent. samples from p(z) because successive samples are highly correlated. If we wish to. obtain independent samples, then we can discard most of the sequence and just re-. tain every M th sample. For M sufficiently large, the retained samples will for all. practical purposes be independent. Figure 11.9 shows a simple illustrative exam-. ple of sampling from a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution using the Metropolis. algorithm in which the proposal distribution is an isotropic Gaussian.. Further insight into the nature of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms can be. gleaned by looking at the properties of a specific example, namely a simple random. 11.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 539.

Consider a state space z consisting of the integers, with probabilities. p(z(τ +1) = z(τ )) = 0.5. p(z(τ +1) = z(τ ) + 1) = 0.25. p(z(τ +1) = z(τ ) − 1) = 0.25. (11.34). (11.35). (11.36). where z(τ ) denotes the state at step τ . If the initial state is z(1) = 0, then by sym-. metry the expected state at time τ will also be zero E[z(τ )] = 0, and similarly it is. easily seen that E[(z(τ ))2] = τ /2. Thus after τ steps, the random walk has only trav-. elled a distance that on average is proportional to the square root of τ . This square. root dependence is typical of random walk behaviour and shows that random walks. are very inefficient in exploring the state space. As we shall see, a central goal in. designing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is to avoid random walk behaviour.. "
212,11.2.1,Markov chains,"Before discussing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in more detail, it is use-. ful to study some general properties of Markov chains in more detail. In particular,. we ask under what circumstances will a Markov chain converge to the desired dis-. tribution. A first-order Markov chain is defined to be a series of random variables. z(1), . . . , z(M ) such that the following conditional independence property holds for. m ∈ {1, . . . , M − 1}. p(z(m+1)|z(1), . . . , z(m)) = p(z(m+1)|z(m)).. (11.37). This of course can be represented as a directed graph in the form of a chain, an ex-. ample of which is shown in Figure 8.38. We can then specify the Markov chain by. giving the probability distribution for the initial variable p(z(0)) together with the. z. z(m). K. 540. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. conditional probabilities for subsequent variables in the form of transition probabil-. ities Tm(z(m), z(m+1)) ≡ p(z(m+1)|z(m)). A Markov chain is called homogeneous. if the transition probabilities are the same for all m.. The marginal probability for a particular variable can be expressed in terms of. the marginal probability for the previous variable in the chain in the form. p(z(m+1)) =. p(z(m+1)|z(m))p(z(m)).. (11.38). A distribution is said to be invariant, or stationary, with respect to a Markov chain. if each step in the chain leaves that distribution invariant. Thus, for a homogeneous. Markov chain with transition probabilities T (z, z), the distribution p(z) is invariant. if. p(z) =. T (z, z)p(z).. (11.39). Note that a given Markov chain may have more than one invariant distribution. For. instance, if the transition probabilities are given by the identity transformation, then. any distribution will be invariant.. A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for ensuring that the required distribu-. tion p(z) is invariant is to choose the transition probabilities to satisfy the property. of detailed balance, defined by. p(z)T (z, z) = p(z)T (z, z). (11.40). for the particular distribution p(z).. It is easily seen that a transition probability. that satisfies detailed balance with respect to a particular distribution will leave that. distribution invariant, because. p(z)T (z, z) =. z. z. p(z)T (z, z) = p(z). p(z|z) = p(z).. (11.41). z. A Markov chain that respects detailed balance is said to be reversible.. Our goal is to use Markov chains to sample from a given distribution. We can. achieve this if we set up a Markov chain such that the desired distribution is invariant.. However, we must also require that for m → ∞, the distribution p(z(m)) converges. to the required invariant distribution p(z), irrespective of the choice of initial dis-. tribution p(z(0)). This property is called ergodicity, and the invariant distribution. is then called the equilibrium distribution. Clearly, an ergodic Markov chain can. have only one equilibrium distribution. It can be shown that a homogeneous Markov. chain will be ergodic, subject only to weak restrictions on the invariant distribution. and the transition probabilities (Neal, 1993).. In practice we often construct the transition probabilities from a set of ‘base’. transitions B1, . . . , BK. This can be achieved through a mixture distribution of the. form. T (z, z) =. αkBk(z, z). k=1. (11.42). 11.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 541. for some set of mixing coefficients α1, . . . , αK satisfying αk � 0 and. k αk = 1..

If a distribution is invariant with respect to each of the base transitions, then obvi-. ously it will also be invariant with respect to either of the T (z, z) given by (11.42). or (11.43). For the case of the mixture (11.42), if each of the base transitions sat-. isfies detailed balance, then the mixture transition T will also satisfy detailed bal-. ance. This does not hold for the transition probability constructed using (11.43), al-. though by symmetrizing the order of application of the base transitions, in the form. B1, B2, . . . , BK, BK, . . . , B2, B1, detailed balance can be restored. A common ex-. ample of the use of composite transition probabilities is where each base transition. changes only a subset of the variables.. "
213,11.2.2,The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,"Earlier we introduced the basic Metropolis algorithm, without actually demon-. strating that it samples from the required distribution. Before giving a proof, we. first discuss a generalization, known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hast-. ings, 1970), to the case where the proposal distribution is no longer a symmetric. function of its arguments. In particular at step τ of the algorithm, in which the cur-. rent state is z(τ ), we draw a sample z from the distribution qk(z|z(τ )) and then. accept it with probability Ak(z, zτ ) where. Ak(z, z(τ )) = min. 1,. (11.44). p(z)qk(z(τ )|z). p(z(τ ))qk(z|z(τ )). Here k labels the members of the set of possible transitions being considered. Again,. the evaluation of the acceptance criterion does not require knowledge of the normal-. izing constant Zp in the probability distribution p(z) =. p(z)/Zp. For a symmetric. proposal distribution the Metropolis-Hastings criterion (11.44) reduces to the stan-. dard Metropolis criterion given by (11.33).. We can show that p(z) is an invariant distribution of the Markov chain defined. by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by showing that detailed balance, defined by. (11.40), is satisfied. Using (11.44) we have. p(z)qk(z|z)Ak(z, z) = min (p(z)qk(z|z), p(z)qk(z|z)). = min (p(z)qk(z|z), p(z)qk(z|z)). = p(z)qk(z|z)Ak(z, z). (11.45). as required.. The specific choice of proposal distribution can have a marked effect on the. performance of the algorithm. For continuous state spaces, a common choice is a. Gaussian centred on the current state, leading to an important trade-off in determin-. ing the variance parameter of this distribution.. If the variance is small, then the. 542. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. Figure 11.10 Schematic illustration of the use of an isotropic. Gaussian proposal distribution (blue circle) to. sample from a correlated multivariate Gaussian. distribution (red ellipse) having very different stan-. dard deviations in different directions, using the. Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.. In order to keep. the rejection rate low, the scale ρ of the proposal. distribution should be on the order of the smallest. standard deviation σmin, which leads to random. walk behaviour in which the number of steps sep-. arating states that are approximately independent. is of order (σmax/σmin)2 where σmax is the largest. standard deviation.. σmin. σmax. proportion of accepted transitions will be high, but progress through the state space. takes the form of a slow random walk leading to long correlation times. However,. if the variance parameter is large, then the rejection rate will be high because, in the. kind of complex problems we are considering, many of the proposed steps will be. to states for which the probability p(z) is low. Consider a multivariate distribution. p(z) having strong correlations between the components of z, as illustrated in Fig-. ure 11.10. The scale ρ of the proposal distribution should be as large as possible. without incurring high rejection rates. This suggests that ρ should be of the same. order as the smallest length scale σmin. The system then explores the distribution. along the more extended direction by means of a random walk, and so the number. of steps to arrive at a state that is more or less independent of the original state is. of order (σmax/σmin)2. In fact in two dimensions, the increase in rejection rate as ρ. increases is offset by the larger steps sizes of those transitions that are accepted, and. more generally for a multivariate Gaussian the number of steps required to obtain. independent samples scales like (σmax/σ2)2 where σ2 is the second-smallest stan-. dard deviation (Neal, 1993). These details aside, it remains the case that if the length. scales over which the distributions vary are very different in different directions, then. the Metropolis Hastings algorithm can have very slow convergence.. "
214,11.3,Gibbs Sampling,"Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984) is a simple and widely applicable Markov. chain Monte Carlo algorithm and can be seen as a special case of the Metropolis-. Hastings algorithm.. Consider the distribution p(z) = p(z1, . . . , zM ) from which we wish to sample,. and suppose that we have chosen some initial state for the Markov chain. Each step. of the Gibbs sampling procedure involves replacing the value of one of the variables. by a value drawn from the distribution of that variable conditioned on the values of. the remaining variables. Thus we replace zi by a value drawn from the distribution. p(zi|z\i), where zi denotes the ith component of z, and z\i denotes z1, . . . , zM but. with zi omitted. This procedure is repeated either by cycling through the variables. 11.3. Gibbs Sampling. 543. in some particular order or by choosing the variable to be updated at each step at. random from some distribution..

New Haven, Connecticut.. In 1863,. Gibbs was granted the first PhD in. engineering in the United States,. and in 1871 he was appointed to. the first chair of mathematical physics in the United. States at Yale, a post for which he received no salary. because at the time he had no publications. He de-. veloped the field of vector analysis and made contri-. butions to crystallography and planetary orbits. His. most famous work, entitled OntheEquilibriumofHet-. erogeneous Substances, laid the foundations for the. science of physical chemistry.. 544. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. To show that this procedure samples from the required distribution, we first of. all note that the distribution p(z) is an invariant of each of the Gibbs sampling steps. individually and hence of the whole Markov chain. This follows from the fact that. when we sample from p(zi|{z\i), the marginal distribution p(z\i) is clearly invariant. because the value of z\i is unchanged. Also, each step by definition samples from the. correct conditional distribution p(zi|z\i). Because these conditional and marginal. distributions together specify the joint distribution, we see that the joint distribution. is itself invariant.. The second requirement to be satisfied in order that the Gibbs sampling proce-. dure samples from the correct distribution is that it be ergodic. A sufficient condition. for ergodicity is that none of the conditional distributions be anywhere zero. If this. is the case, then any point in z space can be reached from any other point in a finite. number of steps involving one update of each of the component variables. If this. requirement is not satisfied, so that some of the conditional distributions have zeros,. then ergodicity, if it applies, must be proven explicitly.. The distribution of initial states must also be specified in order to complete the. algorithm, although samples drawn after many iterations will effectively become. independent of this distribution. Of course, successive samples from the Markov. chain will be highly correlated, and so to obtain samples that are nearly independent. it will be necessary to subsample the sequence.. We can obtain the Gibbs sampling procedure as a particular instance of the. Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as follows. Consider a Metropolis-Hastings sampling. step involving the variable zk in which the remaining variables z\k remain fixed, and. for which the transition probability from z to z is given by qk(z|z) = p(z. k|z\k).. \k = z\k because these components are unchanged by the sampling. We note that z. step. Also, p(z) = p(zk|z\k)p(z\k). Thus the factor that determines the acceptance. probability in the Metropolis-Hastings (11.44) is given by. k|z. \k)p(z. p(z. p(zk|z\k)p(z\k)p(z. \k)p(zk|z. \k). k|z\k). = 1. (11.49). A(z, z) = p(z)qk(z|z). p(z)qk(z|z). where we have used z. accepted.. \k = z\k. Thus the Metropolis-Hastings steps are always. As with the Metropolis algorithm, we can gain some insight into the behaviour of. Gibbs sampling by investigating its application to a Gaussian distribution. Consider. a correlated Gaussian in two variables, as illustrated in Figure 11.11, having con-. ditional distributions of width l and marginal distributions of width L. The typical. step size is governed by the conditional distributions and will be of order l. Because. the state evolves according to a random walk, the number of steps needed to obtain. independent samples from the distribution will be of order (L/l)2. Of course if the. Gaussian distribution were uncorrelated, then the Gibbs sampling procedure would. be optimally efficient. For this simple problem, we could rotate the coordinate sys-. tem in order to decorrelate the variables. However, in practical applications it will. generally be infeasible to find such transformations.. One approach to reducing random walk behaviour in Gibbs sampling is called. over-relaxation (Adler, 1981). In its original form, this applies to problems for which. z2. Figure 11.11 Illustration of Gibbs sampling by alter-. nate updates of two variables whose. distribution is a correlated Gaussian.. The step size is governed by the stan-. dard deviation of the conditional distri-. bution (green curve), and is O(l), lead-. ing to slow progress in the direction of. elongation of the joint distribution (red. ellipse). The number of steps needed. to obtain an independent sample from. the distribution is O((L/l)2).. 11.3. Gibbs Sampling. 545. L. l. z1. the conditional distributions are Gaussian, which represents a more general class of. distributions than the multivariate Gaussian because, for example, the non-Gaussian. distribution p(z, y) ∝ exp(−z2y2) has Gaussian conditional distributions. At each. step of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, the conditional distribution for a particular. component zi has some mean µi and some variance σ2. i . In the over-relaxation frame-. work, the value of zi is replaced with. zi = µi + α(zi − µi) + σi(1 − α2. i )1/2ν. (11.50). where ν is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, and α. is a parameter such that −1 < α < 1. For α = 0, the method is equivalent to. standard Gibbs sampling, and for α < 0 the step is biased to the opposite side of the. mean. This step leaves the desired distribution invariant because if zi has mean µi. i , then so too does zi. The effect of over-relaxation is to encourage. and variance σ2. directed motion through state space when the variables are highly correlated. The. framework of ordered over-relaxation (Neal, 1999) generalizes this approach to non-. Gaussian distributions.. The practical applicability of Gibbs sampling depends on the ease with which. samples can be drawn from the conditional distributions p(zk|z\k). In the case of. probability distributions specified using graphical models, the conditional distribu-. tions for individual nodes depend only on the variables in the corresponding Markov. blankets, as illustrated in Figure 11.12. For directed graphs, a wide choice of condi-. tional distributions for the individual nodes conditioned on their parents will lead to. conditional distributions for Gibbs sampling that are log concave. The adaptive re-. jection sampling methods discussed in Section 11.1.3 therefore provide a framework. for Monte Carlo sampling from directed graphs with broad applicability.. If the graph is constructed using distributions from the exponential family, and. if the parent-child relationships preserve conjugacy, then the full conditional distri-. butions arising in Gibbs sampling will have the same functional form as the orig-. 546. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. Figure 11.12 The Gibbs sampling method requires samples. to be drawn from the conditional distribution of a variable condi-. tioned on the remaining variables. For graphical models, this. conditional distribution is a function only of the states of the. nodes in the Markov blanket. For an undirected graph this com-. prises the set of neighbours, as shown on the left, while for a. directed graph the Markov blanket comprises the parents, the. children, and the co-parents, as shown on the right.. inal conditional distributions (conditioned on the parents) defining each node, and. so standard sampling techniques can be employed. In general, the full conditional. distributions will be of a complex form that does not permit the use of standard sam-. pling algorithms. However, if these conditionals are log concave, then sampling can. be done efficiently using adaptive rejection sampling (assuming the corresponding. variable is a scalar).. If, at each stage of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, instead of drawing a sample. from the corresponding conditional distribution, we make a point estimate of the. variable given by the maximum of the conditional distribution, then we obtain the. iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm discussed in Section 8.3.3. Thus ICM. can be seen as a greedy approximation to Gibbs sampling.. Because the basic Gibbs sampling technique considers one variable at a time,. there are strong dependencies between successive samples. At the opposite extreme,. if we could draw samples directly from the joint distribution (an operation that we. are supposing is intractable), then successive samples would be independent. We can. hope to improve on the simple Gibbs sampler by adopting an intermediate strategy in. which we sample successively from groups of variables rather than individual vari-. ables. This is achieved in the blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm by choosing blocks. of variables, not necessarily disjoint, and then sampling jointly from the variables in. each block in turn, conditioned on the remaining variables (Jensen et al., 1995).. "
215,11.4,Slice Sampling,"We have seen that one of the difficulties with the Metropolis algorithm is the sensi-. tivity to step size. If this is too small, the result is slow decorrelation due to random. walk behaviour, whereas if it is too large the result is inefficiency due to a high rejec-. tion rate. The technique of slice sampling (Neal, 2003) provides an adaptive step size. that is automatically adjusted to match the characteristics of the distribution. Again. it requires that we are able to evaluate the unnormalized distribution. p(z).. Consider first the univariate case. Slice sampling involves augmenting z with. an additional variable u and then drawing samples from the joint (z, u) space. We. shall see another example of this approach when we discuss hybrid Monte Carlo in. Section 11.5. The goal is to sample uniformly from the area under the distribution. e. ˜p(z). u. z(τ ).

(b) Because it is infeasible to sample directly from a slice, a new sample of z is drawn from a region.

This is illustrated in Figure 11.13(a).. and so we can sample from p(z) by sampling from. p(z, u) and then ignoring the u. values. This can be achieved by alternately sampling z and u. Given the value of z. p(z), which is. we evaluate. straightforward. Then we fix u and sample z uniformly from the ‘slice’ through the. distribution defined by {z :. In practice, it can be difficult to sample directly from a slice through the distribu-. tion and so instead we define a sampling scheme that leaves the uniform distribution. p(z, u) invariant, which can be achieved by ensuring that detailed balance is. under. satisfied. Suppose the current value of z is denoted z(τ ) and that we have obtained. a corresponding sample u. The next value of z is obtained by considering a region. zmin � z � zmax that contains z(τ ). It is in the choice of this region that the adap-. tation to the characteristic length scales of the distribution takes place. We want the. region to encompass as much of the slice as possible so as to allow large moves in z. space while having as little as possible of this region lying outside the slice, because. this makes the sampling less efficient.. One approach to the choice of region involves starting with a region containing. z(τ ) having some width w and then testing each of the end points to see if they lie. within the slice.. If either end point does not, then the region is extended in that. direction by increments of value w until the end point lies outside the region. A. candidate value z is then chosen uniformly from this region, and if it lies within the. slice, then it forms z(τ +1). If it lies outside the slice, then the region is shrunk such. that z forms an end point and such that the region still contains z(τ ). Then another. 548. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. candidate point is drawn uniformly from this reduced region and so on, until a value. of z is found that lies within the slice.. Slice sampling can be applied to multivariate distributions by repeatedly sam-. pling each variable in turn, in the manner of Gibbs sampling. This requires that. we are able to compute, for each component zi, a function that is proportional to. p(zi|z\i).. "
216,11.5,The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm,"As we have already noted, one of the major limitations of the Metropolis algorithm. is that it can exhibit random walk behaviour whereby the distance traversed through. the state space grows only as the square root of the number of steps. The problem. cannot be resolved simply by taking bigger steps as this leads to a high rejection rate.. In this section, we introduce a more sophisticated class of transitions based on an. analogy with physical systems and that has the property of being able to make large. changes to the system state while keeping the rejection probability small. It is ap-. plicable to distributions over continuous variables for which we can readily evaluate. the gradient of the log probability with respect to the state variables. We will discuss. "
217,11.5.1,Dynamical systems,"explain how this may be combined with the Metropolis algorithm to yield the pow-. erful hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. A background in physics is not required as this. section is self-contained and the key results are all derived from first principles.. 11.5.1 Dynamical systems. The dynamical approach to stochastic sampling has its origins in algorithms for. simulating the behaviour of physical systems evolving under Hamiltonian dynam-. ics. In a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, the goal is to sample from a given. probability distribution p(z). The framework of Hamiltonian dynamics is exploited. by casting the probabilistic simulation in the form of a Hamiltonian system. In order. to remain in keeping with the literature in this area, we make use of the relevant. dynamical systems terminology where appropriate, which will be defined as we go. along.. The dynamics that we consider corresponds to the evolution of the state variable. z = {zi} under continuous time, which we denote by τ . Classical dynamics is de-. scribed by Newton’s second law of motion in which the acceleration of an object is. proportional to the applied force, corresponding to a second-order differential equa-. tion over time. We can decompose a second-order equation into two coupled first-. order equations by introducing intermediate momentum variables r, corresponding. to the rate of change of the state variables z, having components. ri =. dzi. dτ. (11.53). where the zi can be regarded as position variables in this dynamics perspective. Thus. where E(z) is interpreted as the potential energy of the system when in state z. The. system acceleration is the rate of change of momentum and is given by the applied. force, which itself is the negative gradient of the potential energy. dri. dτ. ∂E(z). ∂zi. (11.54). (11.55). 11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm. 549. for each position variable there is a corresponding momentum variable, and the joint. space of position and momentum variables is called phase space.. Without loss of generality, we can write the probability distribution p(z) in the. form. p(z) =. 1. Zp. exp (−E(z)). It is convenient to reformulate this dynamical system using the Hamiltonian. framework. To do this, we first define the kinetic energy by. K(r) =. 1. 2r2 =. 1. 2. r2. i .. i. (11.56). The total energy of the system is then the sum of its potential and kinetic energies. H(z, r) = E(z) + K(r). (11.57). Exercise 11.15. where H is the Hamiltonian function. Using (11.53), (11.55), (11.56), and (11.57),. we can now express the dynamics of the system in terms of the Hamiltonian equa-. tions given by. dzi. dτ. dri. dτ. = ∂H. ∂ri. ∂H. ∂zi. (11.58). (11.59). William Hamilton. 1805–1865. William Rowan Hamilton was an. Irish mathematician and physicist,. and child prodigy, who was ap-. pointed Professor of Astronomy at. Trinity College, Dublin, in 1827, be-. fore he had even graduated. One. of Hamilton’s most important contributions was a new. formulation of dynamics, which played a significant. role in the later development of quantum mechanics.. His other great achievement was the development of. quaternions, which generalize the concept of complex. numbers by introducing three distinct square roots of. minus one, which satisfy i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1.. It is said that these equations occurred to him while. walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin with his wife,. on 16 October 1843, and he promptly carved the. equations into the side of Broome bridge. Although. there is no longer any evidence of the carving, there is. now a stone plaque on the bridge commemorating the. discovery and displaying the quaternion equations.. i. i. i. 550. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. During the evolution of this dynamical system, the value of the Hamiltonian H is. constant, as is easily seen by differentiation. ∂H. ∂zi. dzi. dτ. + ∂H. ∂ri. dri. dτ. dH. dτ. ∂H. ∂zi. ∂H. ∂ri −. ∂H. ∂ri. ∂H. ∂zi. = 0.. (11.60). A second important property of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, known as Li-. ouville’s Theorem, is that they preserve volume in phase space. In other words, if. we consider a region within the space of variables (z, r), then as this region evolves. under the equations of Hamiltonian dynamics, its shape may change but its volume. will not. This can be seen by noting that the flow field (rate of change of location in. phase space) is given by. dz. dτ. and that the divergence of this field vanishes. V =. dr. dτ. (11.61). div V =. ∂zi. dzi. dτ. dri. dτ. ∂ri. ∂ri. i. ∂zi. ∂H. ∂ri. ∂H. ∂zi. = 0.. (11.62). Now consider the joint distribution over phase space whose total energy is the. Hamiltonian, i.e., the distribution given by. p(z, r) =. 1. ZH. exp(−H(z, r)).. (11.63). Using the two results of conservation of volume and conservation of H, it follows. that the Hamiltonian dynamics will leave p(z, r) invariant. This can be seen by. considering a small region of phase space over which H is approximately constant.. If we follow the evolution of the Hamiltonian equations for a finite time, then the. volume of this region will remain unchanged as will the value of H in this region, and. hence the probability density, which is a function only of H, will also be unchanged.. Although H is invariant, the values of z and r will vary, and so by integrating. the Hamiltonian dynamics over a finite time duration it becomes possible to make. large changes to z in a systematic way that avoids random walk behaviour.. Evolution under the Hamiltonian dynamics will not, however, sample ergodi-. cally from p(z, r) because the value of H is constant. In order to arrive at an ergodic. sampling scheme, we can introduce additional moves in phase space that change. the value of H while also leaving the distribution p(z, r) invariant. The simplest. way to achieve this is to replace the value of r with one drawn from its distribution. conditioned on z. This can be regarded as a Gibbs sampling step, and hence from. Exercise 11.16. 11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm. 551. Section 11.3 we see that this also leaves the desired distribution invariant. Noting. that z and r are independent in the distribution p(z, r), we see that the conditional. distribution p(r|z) is a Gaussian from which it is straightforward to sample.. In a practical application of this approach, we have to address the problem of. performing a numerical integration of the Hamiltonian equations. This will neces-. sarily introduce numerical errors and so we should devise a scheme that minimizes. the impact of such errors. In fact, it turns out that integration schemes can be devised. for which Liouville’s theorem still holds exactly. This property will be important in. "
218,11.5.2,Hybrid Monte Carlo,"for achieving this is called the leapfrog discretization and involves alternately updat-. r to the position and momentum variables. ing discrete-time approximations. using. z and. ri(τ + 	/2) =. zi(τ + 	) =. ri(τ + 	) =. z(τ)). ∂E. ri(τ) −. 2. ∂zi. ri(τ + 	/2). zi(τ) +. ∂E. ri(τ + 	/2) −. ∂zi. 2. z(τ + 	)).. (11.64). (11.65). (11.66). We see that this takes the form of a half-step update of the momentum variables with. step size 	/2, followed by a full-step update of the position variables with step size 	,. followed by a second half-step update of the momentum variables. If several leapfrog. steps are applied in succession, it can be seen that half-step updates to the momentum. variables can be combined into full-step updates with step size 	. The successive. updates to position and momentum variables then leapfrog over each other. In order. to advance the dynamics by a time interval τ , we need to take τ /	 steps. The error. involved in the discretized approximation to the continuous time dynamics will go to. zero, assuming a smooth function E(z), in the limit 	 → 0. However, for a nonzero. as used in practice, some residual error will remain. We shall see in Section 11.5.2. how the effects of such errors can be eliminated in the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm.. In summary then, the Hamiltonian dynamical approach involves alternating be-. tween a series of leapfrog updates and a resampling of the momentum variables from. their marginal distribution.. Note that the Hamiltonian dynamics method, unlike the basic Metropolis algo-. rithm, is able to make use of information about the gradient of the log probability. distribution as well as about the distribution itself. An analogous situation is familiar. from the domain of function optimization. In most cases where gradient informa-. tion is available, it is highly advantageous to make use of it. Informally, this follows. from the fact that in a space of dimension D, the additional computational cost of. evaluating a gradient compared with evaluating the function itself will typically be a. fixed factor independent of D, whereas the D-dimensional gradient vector conveys. D pieces of information compared with the one piece of information given by the. function itself.. 552. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. 11.5.2 Hybrid Monte Carlo. As we discussed in the previous section, for a nonzero step size 	, the discretiza-. tion of the leapfrog algorithm will introduce errors into the integration of the Hamil-. tonian dynamical equations. Hybrid Monte Carlo (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 1996). combines Hamiltonian dynamics with the Metropolis algorithm and thereby removes. any bias associated with the discretization.. Specifically, the algorithm uses a Markov chain consisting of alternate stochastic. updates of the momentum variable r and Hamiltonian dynamical updates using the. leapfrog algorithm. After each application of the leapfrog algorithm, the resulting. candidate state is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion based. on the value of the Hamiltonian H. Thus if (z, r) is the initial state and (z, r). is the state after the leapfrog integration, then this candidate state is accepted with. probability. min (1, exp{H(z, r) − H(z, r)}) .. (11.67). If the leapfrog integration were to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics perfectly,. then every such candidate step would automatically be accepted because the value. of H would be unchanged. Due to numerical errors, the value of H may sometimes. decrease, and we would like the Metropolis criterion to remove any bias due to this. effect and ensure that the resulting samples are indeed drawn from the required dis-. tribution. In order for this to be the case, we need to ensure that the update equations. corresponding to the leapfrog integration satisfy detailed balance (11.40). This is. easily achieved by modifying the leapfrog scheme as follows.. Before the start of each leapfrog integration sequence, we choose at random,. with equal probability, whether to integrate forwards in time (using step size 	) or. backwards in time (using step size −	). We first note that the leapfrog integration. scheme (11.64), (11.65), and (11.66) is time-reversible, so that integration for L steps. using step size −	 will exactly undo the effect of integration for L steps using step. size 	. Next we show that the leapfrog integration preserves phase-space volume. exactly. This follows from the fact that each step in the leapfrog scheme updates. either a zi variable or an ri variable by an amount that is a function only of the other. variable. As shown in Figure 11.14, this has the effect of shearing a region of phase. space while not altering its volume.. Finally, we use these results to show that detailed balance holds. Consider a. small region R of phase space that, under a sequence of L leapfrog iterations of. step size 	, maps to a region R. Using conservation of volume under the leapfrog. iteration, we see that if R has volume δV then so too will R. If we choose an initial. point from the distribution (11.63) and then update it using L leapfrog interactions,. the probability of the transition going from R to R is given by. 1. ZH. exp(−H(R))δV. min{1, exp(−H(R) + H(R))} .. (11.68). 1. 2. where the factor of 1/2 arises from the probability of choosing to integrate with a. positive step size rather than a negative one. Similarly, the probability of starting in. 11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm. 553. ri. zi. 1. ZH. Exercise 11.17. ri. Figure 11.14 Each step of the leapfrog algorithm (11.64)–(11.66) modifies either a position variable zi or a. momentum variable ri. Because the change to one variable is a function only of the other, any region in phase. space will be sheared without change of volume.. zi. region R and integrating backwards in time to end up in region R is given by. exp(−H(R))δV. min{1, exp(−H(R) + H(R))} .. (11.69). 1. 2. It is easily seen that the two probabilities (11.68) and (11.69) are equal, and hence. detailed balance holds. Note that this proof ignores any overlap between the regions. R and R but is easily generalized to allow for such overlap.. It is not difficult to construct examples for which the leapfrog algorithm returns. to its starting position after a finite number of iterations. In such cases, the random. replacement of the momentum values before each leapfrog integration will not be. sufficient to ensure ergodicity because the position variables will never be updated.. Such phenomena are easily avoided by choosing the magnitude of the step size at. random from some small interval, before each leapfrog integration.. We can gain some insight into the behaviour of the hybrid Monte Carlo algo-. rithm by considering its application to a multivariate Gaussian. For convenience,. consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) with independent components, for which the. Hamiltonian is given by. H(z, r) =. 1. 2. i. 1. σ2. i. i +. z2. 1. 2. r2. i .. i. (11.70). Our conclusions will be equally valid for a Gaussian distribution having correlated. components because the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm exhibits rotational isotropy.. During the leapfrog integration, each pair of phase-space variables zi, ri evolves in-. dependently. However, the acceptance or rejection of the candidate point is based. on the value of H, which depends on the values of all of the variables. Thus, a. significant integration error in any one of the variables could lead to a high prob-. ability of rejection. In order that the discrete leapfrog integration be a reasonably. 554. 11. SAMPLING METHODS. good approximation to the true continuous-time dynamics, it is necessary for the. leapfrog integration scale 	 to be smaller than the shortest length-scale over which. the potential is varying significantly. This is governed by the smallest value of σi,. which we denote by σmin. Recall that the goal of the leapfrog integration in hybrid. Monte Carlo is to move a substantial distance through phase space to a new state. that is relatively independent of the initial state and still achieve a high probability of. acceptance. In order to achieve this, the leapfrog integration must be continued for a. number of iterations of order σmax/σmin.. By contrast, consider the behaviour of a simple Metropolis algorithm with an. isotropic Gaussian proposal distribution of variance s2, considered earlier. In order. to avoid high rejection rates, the value of s must be of order σmin. The exploration of. state space then proceeds by a random walk and takes of order (σmax/σmin)2 steps. to arrive at a roughly independent state.. l. "
219,11.6,Estimating the Partition Function,"As we have seen, most of the sampling algorithms considered in this chapter re-. quire only the functional form of the probability distribution up to a multiplicative. constant. Thus if we write. pE(z) =. 1. ZE. exp(−E(z)). (11.71). then the value of the normalization constant ZE, also known as the partition func-. tion, is not needed in order to draw samples from p(z). However, knowledge of the. value of ZE can be useful for Bayesian model comparison since it represents the. model evidence (i.e., the probability of the observed data given the model), and so. it is of interest to consider how its value might be obtained. We assume that direct. evaluation by summing, or integrating, the function exp(−E(z)) over the state space. of z is intractable.. For model comparison, it is actually the ratio of the partition functions for two. models that is required. Multiplication of this ratio by the ratio of prior probabilities. gives the ratio of posterior probabilities, which can then be used for model selection. or model averaging.. One way to estimate a ratio of partition functions is to use importance sampling. from a distribution with energy function G(z). z exp(−E(z)). z exp(−G(z)). z exp(−E(z) + G(z)) exp(−G(z)). ZE. ZG. z exp(−G(z)). = EG(z)[exp(−E + G)]. exp(−E(z(l)) + G(z(l))). (11.72). L. where {z(l)} are samples drawn from the distribution defined by pG(z). If the dis-. tribution pG is one for which the partition function can be evaluated analytically, for. example a Gaussian, then the absolute value of ZE can be obtained.. This approach will only yield accurate results if the importance sampling distri-. bution pG is closely matched to the distribution pE, so that the ratio pE/pG does not. have wide variations. In practice, suitable analytically specified importance sampling. distributions cannot readily be found for the kinds of complex models considered in. this book.. An alternative approach is therefore to use the samples obtained from a Markov. chain to define the importance-sampling distribution. If the transition probability for. the Markov chain is given by T (z, z), and the sample set is given by z(1), . . . , z(L),. then the sampling distribution can be written as. 1. ZG. exp (−G(z)) =. which can be used directly in (11.72).. T (z(l), z). l=1. (11.73). 11.6. Estimating the Partition Function. 555. Methods for estimating the ratio of two partition functions require for their suc-. cess that the two corresponding distributions be reasonably closely matched. This is. especially problematic if we wish to find the absolute value of the partition function. for a complex distribution because it is only for relatively simple distributions that. the partition function can be evaluated directly, and so attempting to estimate the. ratio of partition functions directly is unlikely to be successful. This problem can be. tackled using a technique known as chaining (Neal, 1993; Barber and Bishop, 1997),. which involves introducing a succession of intermediate distributions p2, . . . , pM−1. that interpolate between a simple distribution p1(z) for which we can evaluate the. normalization coefficient Z1 and the desired complex distribution pM (z). We then. have. ZM. Z1. = Z2. Z1. Z3. Z2 ···. ZM. ZM−1. (11.74). in which the intermediate ratios can be determined using Monte Carlo methods as. discussed above. One way to construct such a sequence of intermediate systems. is to use an energy function containing a continuous parameter 0 � α � 1 that. interpolates between the two distributions. Eα(z) = (1 − α)E1(z) + αEM (z).. (11.75). If the intermediate ratios in (11.74) are to be found using Monte Carlo, it may be. more efficient to use a single Markov chain run than to restart the Markov chain for. each ratio. In this case, the Markov chain is run initially for the system p1 and then. after some suitable number of steps moves on to the next distribution in the sequence.. Note, however, that the system must remain close to the equilibrium distribution at. each stage.. 556. 11. SAMPLING METHODS.

220,13,Sequential Data,"So far in this book, we have focussed primarily on sets of data points that were as-. sumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption allowed. us to express the likelihood function as the product over all data points of the prob-. ability distribution evaluated at each data point. For many applications, however,. the i.i.d. assumption will be a poor one. Here we consider a particularly important. class of such data sets, namely those that describe sequential data. These often arise. through measurement of time series, for example the rainfall measurements on suc-. cessive days at a particular location, or the daily values of a currency exchange rate,. or the acoustic features at successive time frames used for speech recognition. An. example involving speech data is shown in Figure 13.1. Sequential data can also. arise in contexts other than time series, for example the sequence of nucleotide base. pairs along a strand of DNA or the sequence of characters in an English sentence.. For convenience, we shall sometimes refer to ‘past’ and ‘future’ observations in a. sequence. However, the models explored in this chapter are equally applicable to all. 605. 606. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.1 Example of a spectro-. gram of the spoken words “Bayes’ theo-. rem” showing a plot of the intensity of the. spectral coefficients versus time index.. forms of sequential data, not just temporal sequences.. It is useful to distinguish between stationary and nonstationary sequential dis-. tributions. In the stationary case, the data evolves in time, but the distribution from. which it is generated remains the same. For the more complex nonstationary situa-. tion, the generative distribution itself is evolving with time. Here we shall focus on. the stationary case.. For many applications, such as financial forecasting, we wish to be able to pre-. dict the next value in a time series given observations of the previous values. In-. tuitively, we expect that recent observations are likely to be more informative than. more historical observations in predicting future values. The example in Figure 13.1. shows that successive observations of the speech spectrum are indeed highly cor-. related. Furthermore, it would be impractical to consider a general dependence of. future observations on all previous observations because the complexity of such a. model would grow without limit as the number of observations increases. This leads. us to consider Markov models in which we assume that future predictions are inde-. N. pendent of all but the most recent observations.. Although such models are tractable, they are also severely limited. We can ob-. tain a more general framework, while still retaining tractability, by the introduction. of latent variables, leading to state space models. As in Chapters 9 and 12, we shall. see that complex models can thereby be constructed from simpler components (in. particular, from distributions belonging to the exponential family) and can be read-. ily characterized using the framework of probabilistic graphical models. Here we. focus on the two most important examples of state space models, namely the hid-. den Markov model, in which the latent variables are discrete, and linear dynamical. systems, in which the latent variables are Gaussian. Both models are described by di-. rected graphs having a tree structure (no loops) for which inference can be performed. efficiently using the sum-product algorithm.. "
221,13.1,Markov Models,"Figure 13.2 The simplest approach to. modelling a sequence of ob-. servations is to treat. them. as independent, correspond-. ing to a graph without links.. x1. 13.1. Markov Models. 607. x3. x4. x2. The easiest way to treat sequential data would be simply to ignore the sequential. aspects and treat the observations as i.i.d., corresponding to the graph in Figure 13.2.. Such an approach, however, would fail to exploit the sequential patterns in the data,. such as correlations between observations that are close in the sequence. Suppose,. for instance, that we observe a binary variable denoting whether on a particular day. it rained or not. Given a time series of recent observations of this variable, we wish. to predict whether it will rain on the next day. If we treat the data as i.i.d., then the. only information we can glean from the data is the relative frequency of rainy days.. However, we know in practice that the weather often exhibits trends that may last for. several days. Observing whether or not it rains today is therefore of significant help. in predicting if it will rain tomorrow.. To express such effects in a probabilistic model, we need to relax the i.i.d. as-. sumption, and one of the simplest ways to do this is to consider a Markov model.. First of all we note that, without loss of generality, we can use the product rule to. express the joint distribution for a sequence of observations in the form. p(x1, . . . , xN ) =. p(xn|x1, . . . , xn−1).. n=1. (13.1). If we now assume that each of the conditional distributions on the right-hand side. is independent of all previous observations except the most recent, we obtain the. first-order Markov chain, which is depicted as a graphical model in Figure 13.3. The. N. N. n=2. 608. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.3 A first-order Markov chain of ob-. servations {xn} in which the dis-. tribution p(xn|xn−1) of a particu-. lar observation xn is conditioned. on the value of the previous ob-. servation xn−1.. x1. x2. x3. x4. Section 8.2. Exercise 13.1. joint distribution for a sequence of N observations under this model is given by. p(x1, . . . , xN ) = p(x1). p(xn|xn−1).. (13.2). From the d-separation property, we see that the conditional distribution for observa-. tion xn, given all of the observations up to time n, is given by. p(xn|x1, . . . , xn−1) = p(xn|xn−1). (13.3). which is easily verified by direct evaluation starting from (13.2) and using the prod-. uct rule of probability. Thus if we use such a model to predict the next observation. in a sequence, the distribution of predictions will depend only on the value of the im-. mediately preceding observation and will be independent of all earlier observations.. In most applications of such models, the conditional distributions p(xn|xn−1). that define the model will be constrained to be equal, corresponding to the assump-. tion of a stationary time series. The model is then known as a homogeneous Markov. chain. For instance, if the conditional distributions depend on adjustable parameters. (whose values might be inferred from a set of training data), then all of the condi-. tional distributions in the chain will share the same values of those parameters.. Although this is more general than the independence model, it is still very re-. strictive. For many sequential observations, we anticipate that the trends in the data. over several successive observations will provide important information in predict-. ing the next value. One way to allow earlier observations to have an influence is to. move to higher-order Markov chains. If we allow the predictions to depend also on. the previous-but-one value, we obtain a second-order Markov chain, represented by. the graph in Figure 13.4. The joint distribution is now given by. p(x1, . . . , xN ) = p(x1)p(x2|x1). p(xn|xn−1, xn−2).. n=3. (13.4). Again, using d-separation or by direct evaluation, we see that the conditional distri-. bution of xn given xn−1 and xn−2 is independent of all observations x1, . . . xn−3..

Figure 13.5 We can represent sequen-. tial data using a Markov chain of latent. variables, with each observation condi-. tioned on the state of the corresponding. latent variable. This important graphical. structure forms the foundation both for the. hidden Markov model and for linear dy-. namical systems.. z1. x1. z2. x2. 13.1. Markov Models. 609. zn−1. xn−1. zn. xn. zn+1. xn+1. Each observation is now influenced by two previous observations. We can similarly. consider extensions to an M th order Markov chain in which the conditional distri-. bution for a particular variable depends on the previous M variables. However, we. have paid a price for this increased flexibility because the number of parameters in. the model is now much larger. Suppose the observations are discrete variables hav-. ing K states. Then the conditional distribution p(xn|xn−1) in a first-order Markov. chain will be specified by a set of K − 1 parameters for each of the K states of xn−1. giving a total of K(K − 1) parameters. Now suppose we extend the model to an. M th order Markov chain, so that the joint distribution is built up from conditionals. p(xn|xn−M , . . . , xn−1). If the variables are discrete, and if the conditional distri-. butions are represented by general conditional probability tables, then the number. of parameters in such a model will have KM−1(K − 1) parameters. Because this. grows exponentially with M, it will often render this approach impractical for larger. values of M.. For continuous variables, we can use linear-Gaussian conditional distributions. in which each node has a Gaussian distribution whose mean is a linear function. of its parents. This is known as an autoregressive or AR model (Box et al., 1994;. Thiesson et al., 2004). An alternative approach is to use a parametric model for. p(xn|xn−M , . . . , xn−1) such as a neural network. This technique is sometimes. called a tapped delay line because it corresponds to storing (delaying) the previous. M values of the observed variable in order to predict the next value. The number. of parameters can then be much smaller than in a completely general model (for ex-. ample it may grow linearly with M), although this is achieved at the expense of a. restricted family of conditional distributions.. Suppose we wish to build a model for sequences that is not limited by the. Markov assumption to any order and yet that can be specified using a limited number. of free parameters. We can achieve this by introducing additional latent variables to. permit a rich class of models to be constructed out of simple components, as we did. with mixture distributions in Chapter 9 and with continuous latent variable models in. Chapter 12. For each observation xn, we introduce a corresponding latent variable. zn (which may be of different type or dimensionality to the observed variable). We. now assume that it is the latent variables that form a Markov chain, giving rise to the. graphical structure known as a state space model, which is shown in Figure 13.5. It. satisfies the key conditional independence property that zn−1 and zn+1 are indepen-. dent given zn, so that. (13.5). zn+1 ⊥⊥ zn−1 | zn.. N. p(xn|zn).. n=1. (13.6). N. 610. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. The joint distribution for this model is given by. p(x1, . . . , xN , z1, . . . , zN ) = p(z1). n=2. p(zn|zn−1). Using the d-separation criterion, we see that there is always a path connecting any. two observed variables xn and xm via the latent variables, and that this path is never. blocked. Thus the predictive distribution p(xn+1|x1, . . . , xn) for observation xn+1. given all previous observations does not exhibit any conditional independence prop-. erties, and so our predictions for xn+1 depends on all previous observations. The. observed variables, however, do not satisfy the Markov property at any order. We. shall discuss how to evaluate the predictive distribution in later sections of this chap-. ter.. There are two important models for sequential data that are described by this. graph. If the latent variables are discrete, then we obtain the hidden Markov model,. or HMM (Elliott et al., 1995). Note that the observed variables in an HMM may. be discrete or continuous, and a variety of different conditional distributions can be. used to model them. If both the latent and the observed variables are Gaussian (with. a linear-Gaussian dependence of the conditional distributions on their parents), then. we obtain the linear dynamical system.. Section 13.2. Section 13.3. "
222,13.2,Hidden Markov Models,"The hidden Markov model can be viewed as a specific instance of the state space. model of Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete. However, if we. examine a single time slice of the model, we see that it corresponds to a mixture. distribution, with component densities given by p(x|z).. It can therefore also be. interpreted as an extension of a mixture model in which the choice of mixture com-. ponent for each observation is not selected independently but depends on the choice. of component for the previous observation. The HMM is widely used in speech. recognition (Jelinek, 1997; Rabiner and Juang, 1993), natural language modelling. (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999), on-line handwriting recognition (Nag et al., 1986),. and for the analysis of biological sequences such as proteins and DNA (Krogh et al.,. 1994; Durbin et al., 1998; Baldi and Brunak, 2001).. As in the case of a standard mixture model, the latent variables are the discrete. multinomial variables zn describing which component of the mixture is responsible. for generating the corresponding observation xn. Again, it is convenient to use a. 1-of-K coding scheme, as used for mixture models in Chapter 9. We now allow the. probability distribution of zn to depend on the state of the previous latent variable. zn−1 through a conditional distribution p(zn|zn−1). Because the latent variables are. K-dimensional binary variables, this conditional distribution corresponds to a table. of numbers that we denote by A, the elements of which are known as transition. probabilities. They are given by Ajk ≡ p(znk = 1|zn−1,j = 1), and because they. are probabilities, they satisfy 0 � Ajk � 1 with. k Ajk = 1, so that the matrix A. j=1. K. K. K. k=1.

We can then write the conditional distribution. explicitly in the form. p(zn|zn−1,A) =. Azn−1,j znk. jk. (13.7). The initial latent node z1 is special in that it does not have a parent node, and so. it has a marginal distribution p(z1) represented by a vector of probabilities π with. elements πk ≡ p(z1k = 1), so that. p(z1|π) =. πz1k. k. k=1. (13.8). where. k πk = 1.. The transition matrix is sometimes illustrated diagrammatically by drawing the. states as nodes in a state transition diagram as shown in Figure 13.6 for the case of. K = 3. Note that this does not represent a probabilistic graphical model, because. the nodes are not separate variables but rather states of a single variable, and so we. have shown the states as boxes rather than circles.. Section 8.4.5. It is sometimes useful to take a state transition diagram, of the kind shown in. Figure 13.6, and unfold it over time. This gives an alternative representation of the. transitions between latent states, known as a lattice or trellis diagram, and which is. shown for the case of the hidden Markov model in Figure 13.7.. The specification of the probabilistic model is completed by defining the con-. ditional distributions of the observed variables p(xn|zn, φ), where φ is a set of pa-. rameters governing the distribution. These are known as emission probabilities, and. might for example be given by Gaussians of the form (9.11) if the elements of x are. continuous variables, or by conditional probability tables if x is discrete. Because. xn is observed, the distribution p(xn|zn, φ) consists, for a given value of φ, of a. vector of K numbers corresponding to the K possible states of the binary vector zn.. K. N. N. k = 1. k = 2. 612. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.7 If we unfold the state transition dia-. gram of Figure 13.6 over time, we obtain a lattice,. or trellis, representation of the latent states.

We shall focuss attention on homogeneous models for which all of the condi-. tional distributions governing the latent variables share the same parameters A, and. similarly all of the emission distributions share the same parameters φ (the extension. to more general cases is straightforward). Note that a mixture model for an i.i.d. data. set corresponds to the special case in which the parameters Ajk are the same for all. values of j, so that the conditional distribution p(zn|zn−1) is independent of zn−1.. This corresponds to deleting the horizontal links in the graphical model shown in. Figure 13.5.. The joint probability distribution over both latent and observed variables is then. given by. p(X, Z|θ) = p(z1|π). p(zn|zn−1, A). n=2. m=1. p(xm|zm, φ). (13.10). where X = {x1, . . . , xN}, Z = {z1, . . . , zN}, and θ = {π, A, φ} denotes the set. of parameters governing the model. Most of our discussion of the hidden Markov. model will be independent of the particular choice of the emission probabilities.. Indeed, the model is tractable for a wide range of emission distributions including. discrete tables, Gaussians, and mixtures of Gaussians. It is also possible to exploit. discriminative models such as neural networks. These can be used to model the. emission density p(x|z) directly, or to provide a representation for p(z|x) that can. be converted into the required emission density p(x|z) using Bayes’ theorem (Bishop. et al., 2004).. We can gain a better understanding of the hidden Markov model by considering. it from a generative point of view. Recall that to generate samples from a mixture of.

(a) Contours of constant probability density for the. emission distributions corresponding to each of the three states of the latent variable. (b) A sample of 50 points. drawn from the hidden Markov model, colour coded according to the component that generated them and with. lines connecting the successive observations. Here the transition matrix was fixed so that in any state there is a. 5% probability of making a transition to each of the other states, and consequently a 90% probability of remaining. in the same state.. Gaussians, we first chose one of the components at random with probability given by. the mixing coefficients πk and then generate a sample vector x from the correspond-. ing Gaussian component. This process is repeated N times to generate a data set of. N independent samples. In the case of the hidden Markov model, this procedure is. modified as follows. We first choose the initial latent variable z1 with probabilities. governed by the parameters πk and then sample the corresponding observation x1.. Now we choose the state of the variable z2 according to the transition probabilities. p(z2|z1) using the already instantiated value of z1. Thus suppose that the sample for. z1 corresponds to state j. Then we choose the state k of z2 with probabilities Ajk. for k = 1, . . . , K. Once we know z2 we can draw a sample for x2 and also sample. the next latent variable z3 and so on. This is an example of ancestral sampling for. a directed graphical model. If, for instance, we have a model in which the diago-. nal transition elements Akk are much larger than the off-diagonal elements, then a. typical data sequence will have long runs of points generated from a single compo-. nent, with infrequent transitions from one component to another. The generation of. samples from a hidden Markov model is illustrated in Figure 13.8.. There are many variants of the standard HMM model, obtained for instance by. imposing constraints on the form of the transition matrix A (Rabiner, 1989). Here we. mention one of particular practical importance called the left-to-right HMM, which. is obtained by setting the elements Ajk of A to zero if k < j, as illustrated in the. Section 8.1.2. 614. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.9 Example of the state transition diagram for a 3-state. left-to-right hidden Markov model. Note that once a. state has been vacated, it cannot later be re-entered.. A11. A22. A33. A12. A23. k = 1. A13. k = 2. k = 3. state transition diagram for a 3-state HMM in Figure 13.9. Typically for such models. the initial state probabilities for p(z1) are modified so that p(z11) = 1 and p(z1j) = 0. for j = 1, in other words every sequence is constrained to start in state j = 1. The. transition matrix may be further constrained to ensure that large changes in the state. index do not occur, so that Ajk = 0 if k > j + ∆. This type of model is illustrated. using a lattice diagram in Figure 13.10.. Many applications of hidden Markov models, for example speech recognition,. or on-line character recognition, make use of left-to-right architectures. As an illus-. tration of the left-to-right hidden Markov model, we consider an example involving. handwritten digits. This uses on-line data, meaning that each digit is represented. by the trajectory of the pen as a function of time in the form of a sequence of pen. coordinates, in contrast to the off-line digits data, discussed in Appendix A, which. comprises static two-dimensional pixellated images of the ink. Examples of the on-. line digits are shown in Figure 13.11. Here we train a hidden Markov model on a. subset of data comprising 45 examples of the digit ‘2’. There are K = 16 states,. each of which can generate a line segment of fixed length having one of 16 possible. angles, and so the emission distribution is simply a 16 × 16 table of probabilities. associated with the allowed angle values for each state index value. Transition prob-. abilities are all set to zero except for those that keep the state index k the same or. that increment it by 1, and the model parameters are optimized using 25 iterations of. EM. We can gain some insight into the resulting model by running it generatively, as. shown in Figure 13.11..

Bottom row: synthetic digits sam-. pled generatively from a left-to-right hid-. den Markov model that has been trained. on a data set of 45 handwritten digits.. One of the most powerful properties of hidden Markov models is their ability to. exhibit some degree of invariance to local warping (compression and stretching) of. the time axis. To understand this, consider the way in which the digit ‘2’ is written. in the on-line handwritten digits example. A typical digit comprises two distinct. sections joined at a cusp. The first part of the digit, which starts at the top left, has a. sweeping arc down to the cusp or loop at the bottom left, followed by a second more-. or-less straight sweep ending at the bottom right. Natural variations in writing style. will cause the relative sizes of the two sections to vary, and hence the location of the. cusp or loop within the temporal sequence will vary. From a generative perspective. such variations can be accommodated by the hidden Markov model through changes. in the number of transitions to the same state versus the number of transitions to the. successive state. Note, however, that if a digit ‘2’ is written in the reverse order, that. is, starting at the bottom right and ending at the top left, then even though the pen tip. coordinates may be identical to an example from the training set, the probability of. the observations under the model will be extremely small. In the speech recognition. context, warping of the time axis is associated with natural variations in the speed of. speech, and again the hidden Markov model can accommodate such a distortion and. not penalize it too heavily.. "
223,13.2.1,Maximum likelihood for the HMM,"If we have observed a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we can determine the param-. eters of an HMM using maximum likelihood. The likelihood function is obtained. from the joint distribution (13.10) by marginalizing over the latent variables. p(X|θ) =. p(X, Z|θ).. Z. (13.11). Because the joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) does not factorize over n (in contrast to the. mixture distribution considered in Chapter 9), we cannot simply treat each of the. summations over zn independently. Nor can we perform the summations explicitly. because there are N variables to be summed over, each of which has K states, re-. sulting in a total of K N terms. Thus the number of terms in the summation grows. 616. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Section 9.2. exponentially with the length of the chain. In fact, the summation in (13.11) cor-. responds to summing over exponentially many paths through the lattice diagram in. Figure 13.7.. We have already encountered a similar difficulty when we considered the infer-. ence problem for the simple chain of variables in Figure 8.32. There we were able. to make use of the conditional independence properties of the graph to re-order the. summations in order to obtain an algorithm whose cost scales linearly, instead of. exponentially, with the length of the chain. We shall apply a similar technique to the. hidden Markov model.. A further difficulty with the expression (13.11) for the likelihood function is that,. because it corresponds to a generalization of a mixture distribution, it represents a. summation over the emission models for different settings of the latent variables.. Direct maximization of the likelihood function will therefore lead to complex ex-. pressions with no closed-form solutions, as was the case for simple mixture models. (recall that a mixture model for i.i.d. data is a special case of the HMM).. We therefore turn to the expectation maximization algorithm to find an efficient. framework for maximizing the likelihood function in hidden Markov models. The. EM algorithm starts with some initial selection for the model parameters, which we. denote by θold. In the E step, we take these parameter values and find the posterior. distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, θold). We then use this posterior distri-. bution to evaluate the expectation of the logarithm of the complete-data likelihood. function, as a function of the parameters θ, to give the function Q(θ, θold) defined. by. Q(θ, θold) =. Z. p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ).. At this point, it is convenient to introduce some notation. We shall use γ(zn) to. denote the marginal posterior distribution of a latent variable zn, and ξ(zn−1, zn) to. denote the joint posterior distribution of two successive latent variables, so that. γ(zn) = p(zn|X, θold). ξ(zn−1, zn) = p(zn−1, zn|X, θold).. For each value of n, we can store γ(zn) using a set of K nonnegative numbers. that sum to unity, and similarly we can store ξ(zn−1, zn) using a K × K matrix of. nonnegative numbers that again sum to unity. We shall also use γ(znk) to denote the. conditional probability of znk = 1, with a similar use of notation for ξ(zn−1,j, znk). and for other probabilistic variables introduced later. Because the expectation of a. binary random variable is just the probability that it takes the value 1, we have. γ(znk) = E[znk] =. z. γ(z)znk. ξ(zn−1,j, znk) = E[zn−1,jznk] =. γ(z)zn−1,jznk.. z. If we substitute the joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) given by (13.10) into (13.12),. (13.12). (13.13). (13.14). (13.15). (13.16). k=1. K. N. K. K. K. γ(z1k). K. γ(z1j). n=2. n=2. j=1. N. N. K. N. 13.2.

The goal of the E step will be to evaluate the quantities γ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn) effi-. ciently, and we shall discuss this in detail shortly.. In the M step, we maximize Q(θ, θold) with respect to the parameters θ =. {π, A, φ} in which we treat γ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn) as constant. Maximization with. respect to π and A is easily achieved using appropriate Lagrange multipliers with. the results. πk =. Ajk =. (13.18). (13.19). ξ(zn−1,j, znk). ξ(zn−1,j, znl). l=1. n=2. The EM algorithm must be initialized by choosing starting values for π and A, which. should of course respect the summation constraints associated with their probabilis-. tic interpretation. Note that any elements of π or A that are set to zero initially will. remain zero in subsequent EM updates. A typical initialization procedure would. involve selecting random starting values for these parameters subject to the summa-. tion and non-negativity constraints. Note that no particular modification to the EM. results are required for the case of left-to-right models beyond choosing initial values. for the elements Ajk in which the appropriate elements are set to zero, because these. will remain zero throughout.. To maximize Q(θ, θold) with respect to φk, we notice that only the final term. in (13.17) depends on φk, and furthermore this term has exactly the same form as. the data-dependent term in the corresponding function for a standard mixture dis-. tribution for i.i.d. data, as can be seen by comparison with (9.40) for the case of a. Gaussian mixture. Here the quantities γ(znk) are playing the role of the responsibil-. ities. If the parameters φk are independent for the different components, then this. term decouples into a sum of terms one for each value of k, each of which can be. maximized independently. We are then simply maximizing the weighted log likeli-. hood function for the emission density p(x|φk) with weights γ(znk). Here we shall. suppose that this maximization can be done efficiently. For instance, in the case of. Exercise 13.5. Exercise 13.6. n=1. N. n=1. N. N. n=1. i=1. K. D. N. k=1. µk =. γ(znk)xn. γ(znk). γ(znk)(xn − µk)(xn − µk)T. Σk =. n=1. γ(znk). (13.20). (13.21). For the case of discrete multinomial observed variables, the conditional distribution. of the observations takes the form. p(x|z) =. µxizk. ik. (13.22). and the corresponding M-step equations are given by. N. γ(znk)xni. µik =. n=1. N. (13.23). γ(znk). n=1. An analogous result holds for Bernoulli observed variables.. The EM algorithm requires initial values for the parameters of the emission dis-. tribution. One way to set these is first to treat the data initially as i.i.d. and fit the. emission density by maximum likelihood, and then use the resulting values to ini-. tialize the parameters for EM.. "
224,13.2.2,The forward-backward algorithm,"Next we seek an efficient procedure for evaluating the quantities γ(znk) and. ξ(zn−1,j, znk), corresponding to the E step of the EM algorithm. The graph for the. hidden Markov model, shown in Figure 13.5, is a tree, and so we know that the. posterior distribution of the latent variables can be obtained efficiently using a two-. stage message passing algorithm. In the particular context of the hidden Markov. model, this is known as the forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989), or the. Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972). There are in fact several variants of the basic. algorithm, all of which lead to the exact marginals, according to the precise form of. 618. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Gaussian emission densities we have p(x|φk) = N (x|µk, Σk), and maximization. of the function Q(θ, θold) then gives. Exercise 13.8. Section 8.4. 13.2. Hidden Markov Models. 619. the messages that are propagated along the chain (Jordan, 2007). We shall focus on. the most widely used of these, known as the alpha-beta algorithm.. As well as being of great practical importance in its own right, the forward-. backward algorithm provides us with a nice illustration of many of the concepts. introduced in earlier chapters. We shall therefore begin in this section with a ‘con-. ventional’ derivation of the forward-backward equations, making use of the sum. and product rules of probability, and exploiting conditional independence properties. which we shall obtain from the corresponding graphical model using d-separation.. Then in Section 13.2.3, we shall see how the forward-backward algorithm can be. obtained very simply as a specific example of the sum-product algorithm introduced. in Section 8.4.4.. It is worth emphasizing that evaluation of the posterior distributions of the latent. variables is independent of the form of the emission density p(x|z) or indeed of. whether the observed variables are continuous or discrete. All we require is the. values of the quantities p(xn|zn) for each value of zn for every n. Also, in this. section and the next we shall omit the explicit dependence on the model parameters. θold because these fixed throughout.. We therefore begin by writing down the following conditional independence. properties (Jordan, 2007). p(X|zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn|zn). p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn). p(x1, . . . , xn−1|xn, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn). p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1). p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn, zn+1) = p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn+1). p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1, xn+1) = p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1). p(X|zn−1, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1). (13.24). (13.25). (13.26). (13.27). (13.28). p(zN +1|zN , X) = p(zN +1|zN ). p(xN +1|X, zN +1) = p(xN +1|zN +1). p(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn) (13.29). (13.30). (13.31). where X = {x1, . . . , xN}. These relations are most easily proved using d-separation.. For instance in the first of these results, we note that every path from any one of the. nodes x1, . . . , xn−1 to the node xn passes through the node zn, which is observed.. Because all such paths are head-to-tail, it follows that the conditional independence. property must hold. The reader should take a few moments to verify each of these. properties in turn, as an exercise in the application of d-separation. These relations. can also be proved directly, though with significantly greater effort, from the joint. distribution for the hidden Markov model using the sum and product rules of proba-. bility.. Let us begin by evaluating γ(znk). Recall that for a discrete multinomial ran-. dom variable the expected value of one of its components is just the probability of. that component having the value 1. Thus we are interested in finding the posterior. distribution p(zn|x1, . . . , xN ) of zn given the observed data set x1, . . . , xN . This. Exercise 13.10. 620. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. represents a vector of length K whose entries correspond to the expected values of. znk. Using Bayes’ theorem, we have. γ(zn) = p(zn|X) = p(X|zn)p(zn). p(X). (13.32). zn−1. zn−1. zn−1. zn−1. zn−1. Note that the denominator p(X) is implicitly conditioned on the parameters θold. of the HMM and hence represents the likelihood function. Using the conditional. independence property (13.24), together with the product rule of probability, we. obtain. γ(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn). p(X). = α(zn)β(zn). p(X). (13.33). where we have defined. α(zn) ≡ p(x1, . . . , xn, zn). β(zn) ≡ p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn).. (13.34). (13.35). The quantity α(zn) represents the joint probability of observing all of the given. data up to time n and the value of zn, whereas β(zn) represents the conditional. probability of all future data from time n + 1 up to N given the value of zn. Again,. α(zn) and β(zn) each represent set of K numbers, one for each of the possible. settings of the 1-of-K coded binary vector zn. We shall use the notation α(znk) to. denote the value of α(zn) when znk = 1, with an analogous interpretation of β(znk).. We now derive recursion relations that allow α(zn) and β(zn) to be evaluated. efficiently. Again, we shall make use of conditional independence properties, in. particular (13.25) and (13.26), together with the sum and product rules, allowing us. to express α(zn) in terms of α(zn−1) as follows. α(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn). = p(x1, . . . , xn|zn)p(zn). = p(xn|zn)p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn)p(zn). = p(xn|zn)p(x1, . . . , xn−1, zn). = p(xn|zn). p(x1, . . . , xn−1, zn−1, zn). = p(xn|zn). = p(xn|zn). = p(xn|zn). p(x1, . . . , xn−1, zn|zn−1)p(zn−1). p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)p(zn|zn−1)p(zn−1). p(x1, . . . , xn−1, zn−1)p(zn|zn−1). Making use of the definition (13.34) for α(zn), we then obtain. α(zn−1)p(zn|zn−1).. α(zn) = p(xn|zn). (13.36). K. zn+1. zn+1. zn+1. Figure 13.12 Illustration of the forward recursion (13.36) for. evaluation of the α variables.. In this fragment. of the lattice, we see that the quantity α(zn1). is obtained by taking the elements α(zn−1,j) of. α(zn−1) at step n−1 and summing them up with. weights given by Aj1, corresponding to the val-. ues of p(zn|zn−1), and then multiplying by the. data contribution p(xn|zn1).. 621. p(xn|zn,1). 13.2.

Note. that there are K terms in the summation, and the right-hand side has to be evaluated. for each of the K values of zn so each step of the α recursion has computational. cost that scaled like O(K 2). The forward recursion equation for α(zn) is illustrated. using a lattice diagram in Figure 13.12.. In order to start this recursion, we need an initial condition that is given by. α(z1) = p(x1, z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1) =. {πkp(x1|φk)}z1k. k=1. (13.37). which tells us that α(z1k), for k = 1, . . . , K, takes the value πkp(x1|φk). Starting. at the first node of the chain, we can then work along the chain and evaluate α(zn). for every latent node. Because each step of the recursion involves multiplying by a. K × K matrix, the overall cost of evaluating these quantities for the whole chain is. of O(K 2N).. We can similarly find a recursion relation for the quantities β(zn) by making. use of the conditional independence properties (13.27) and (13.28) giving. β(zn) = p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn). p(xn+1, . . . , xN , zn+1|zn). p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn, zn+1)p(zn+1|zn). p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn+1)p(zn+1|zn). p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1)p(xn+1|zn+1)p(zn+1|zn).. zn+1. 622. 13.

In. this fragment of the lattice, we see that the. quantity β(zn1) is obtained by taking the. components β(zn+1,k) of β(zn+1) at step. n + 1 and summing them up with weights. given by the products of A1k, correspond-. ing to the values of p(zn+1|zn) and the cor-. responding values of the emission density. p(xn|zn+1,k)..

(13.38). Note that in this case we have a backward message passing algorithm that evaluates. β(zn) in terms of β(zn+1). At each step, we absorb the effect of observation xn+1. through the emission probability p(xn+1|zn+1), multiply by the transition matrix. p(zn+1|zn), and then marginalize out zn+1. This is illustrated in Figure 13.13.. Again we need a starting condition for the recursion, namely a value for β(zN ).. This can be obtained by setting n = N in (13.33) and replacing α(zN ) with its. definition (13.34) to give. p(zN|X) = p(X, zN )β(zN ). p(X). (13.39). which we see will be correct provided we take β(zN ) = 1 for all settings of zN .. In the M step equations, the quantity p(X) will cancel out, as can be seen, for. instance, in the M-step equation for µk given by (13.20), which takes the form. γ(znk)xn. α(znk)β(znk)xn. (13.40). µk =. γ(znk). α(znk)β(znk). n=1. However, the quantity p(X) represents the likelihood function whose value we typ-. ically wish to monitor during the EM optimization, and so it is useful to be able to. evaluate it. If we sum both sides of (13.33) over zn, and use the fact that the left-hand. side is a normalized distribution, we obtain. p(X) =. α(zn)β(zn).. zn. (13.41). 13.2. Hidden Markov Models. 623. Thus we can evaluate the likelihood function by computing this sum, for any conve-. nient choice of n. For instance, if we only want to evaluate the likelihood function,. then we can do this by running the α recursion from the start to the end of the chain,. and then use this result for n = N, making use of the fact that β(zN ) is a vector of. 1s. In this case no β recursion is required, and we simply have. p(X) =. α(zN ).. zN. (13.42). Let us take a moment to interpret this result for p(X). Recall that to compute the. likelihood we should take the joint distribution p(X, Z) and sum over all possible. values of Z. Each such value represents a particular choice of hidden state for every. time step, in other words every term in the summation is a path through the lattice. diagram, and recall that there are exponentially many such paths. By expressing. the likelihood function in the form (13.42), we have reduced the computational cost. from being exponential in the length of the chain to being linear by swapping the. order of the summation and multiplications, so that at each time step n we sum. the contributions from all paths passing through each of the states znk to give the. intermediate quantities α(zn).. Next we consider the evaluation of the quantities ξ(zn−1, zn), which correspond. to the values of the conditional probabilities p(zn−1, zn|X) for each of the K × K. settings for (zn−1, zn). Using the definition of ξ(zn−1, zn), and applying Bayes’. theorem, we have. ξ(zn−1, zn) = p(zn−1, zn|X). = p(X|zn−1, zn)p(zn−1, zn). = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)p(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)p(zn|zn−1)p(zn−1). = α(zn−1)p(xn|zn)p(zn|zn−1)β(zn). (13.43). p(X). p(X). p(X). where we have made use of the conditional independence property (13.29) together. with the definitions of α(zn) and β(zn) given by (13.34) and (13.35). Thus we can. calculate the ξ(zn−1, zn) directly by using the results of the α and β recursions.. Let us summarize the steps required to train a hidden Markov model using. the EM algorithm. We first make an initial selection of the parameters θold where. θ ≡ (π, A, φ). The A and π parameters are often initialized either uniformly or. randomly from a uniform distribution (respecting their non-negativity and summa-. tion constraints). Initialization of the parameters φ will depend on the form of the. distribution. For instance in the case of Gaussians, the parameters µk might be ini-. tialized by applying the K-means algorithm to the data, and Σk might be initialized. to the covariance matrix of the corresponding K means cluster. Then we run both. the forward α recursion and the backward β recursion and use the results to evaluate. γ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn). At this stage, we can also evaluate the likelihood function.. zN+1. zN+1. zN+1. zN+1. zN+1. 1. zN. zN. zN. p(xN +1|X) =. p(xN +1, zN +1|X). p(xN +1|zN +1)p(zN +1|X). p(xN +1|zN +1). p(zN +1, zN|X). p(xN +1|zN +1). p(xN +1|zN +1). p(zN +1|zN )p(zN|X). p(zN +1|zN ) p(zN , X). p(X). p(X). zN+1. p(xN +1|zN +1). zN. p(zN +1|zN )α(zN ) (13.44). which can be evaluated by first running a forward α recursion and then computing. the final summations over zN and zN +1. The result of the first summation over zN. can be stored and used once the value of xN +1 is observed in order to run the α. recursion forward to the next step in order to predict the subsequent value xN +2.. 624. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. This completes the E step, and we use the results to find a revised set of parameters. θnew using the M-step equations from Section 13.2.1. We then continue to alternate. between E and M steps until some convergence criterion is satisfied, for instance. when the change in the likelihood function is below some threshold.. Note that in these recursion relations the observations enter through conditional. distributions of the form p(xn|zn). The recursions are therefore independent of. the type or dimensionality of the observed variables or the form of this conditional. distribution, so long as its value can be computed for each of the K possible states. of zn. Since the observed variables {xn} are fixed, the quantities p(xn|zn) can be. pre-computed as functions of zn at the start of the EM algorithm, and remain fixed. throughout.. We have seen in earlier chapters that the maximum likelihood approach is most. effective when the number of data points is large in relation to the number of parame-. ters. Here we note that a hidden Markov model can be trained effectively, using max-. imum likelihood, provided the training sequence is sufficiently long. Alternatively,. we can make use of multiple shorter sequences, which requires a straightforward. modification of the hidden Markov model EM algorithm. In the case of left-to-right. models, this is particularly important because, in a given observation sequence, a. given state transition corresponding to a nondiagonal element of A will seen at most. once.. Another quantity of interest is the predictive distribution, in which the observed. data is X = {x1, . . . , xN} and we wish to predict xN +1, which would be important. for real-time applications such as financial forecasting. Again we make use of the. sum and product rules together with the conditional independence properties (13.29). and (13.31) giving. Exercise 13.12.

Thus the predictive distribution can be carried forward indefinitely. using a fixed amount of storage, as may be required for real-time applications.. Here we have discussed the estimation of the parameters of an HMM using max-. imum likelihood. This framework is easily extended to regularized maximum likeli-. hood by introducing priors over the model parameters π, A and φ whose values are. then estimated by maximizing their posterior probability. This can again be done us-. ing the EM algorithm in which the E step is the same as discussed above, and the M. step involves adding the log of the prior distribution p(θ) to the function Q(θ, θold). before maximization and represents a straightforward application of the techniques. developed at various points in this book. Furthermore, we can use variational meth-. ods to give a fully Bayesian treatment of the HMM in which we marginalize over the. parameter distributions (MacKay, 1997). As with maximum likelihood, this leads to. a two-pass forward-backward recursion to compute posterior probabilities.. "
225,13.2.3,The sum-product algorithm for the HMM,"The directed graph that represents the hidden Markov model, shown in Fig-. ure 13.5, is a tree and so we can solve the problem of finding local marginals for the. hidden variables using the sum-product algorithm. Not surprisingly, this turns out to. be equivalent to the forward-backward algorithm considered in the previous section,. and so the sum-product algorithm therefore provides us with a simple way to derive. the alpha-beta recursion formulae.. We begin by transforming the directed graph of Figure 13.5 into a factor graph,. of which a representative fragment is shown in Figure 13.14. This form of the fac-. tor graph shows all variables, both latent and observed, explicitly. However, for. the purpose of solving the inference problem, we shall always be conditioning on. the variables x1, . . . , xN , and so we can simplify the factor graph by absorbing the. emission probabilities into the transition probability factors. This leads to the sim-. plified factor graph representation in Figure 13.15, in which the factors are given. by. h(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1). fn(zn−1, zn) = p(zn|zn−1)p(xn|zn).. (13.45). (13.46). z1. zn−1. 626. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.15 A simplified form of fac-. tor graph to describe the hidden Markov. model.. h. fn. zn−1. zn. To derive the alpha-beta algorithm, we denote the final hidden variable zN as. the root node, and first pass messages from the leaf node h to the root. From the. general results (8.66) and (8.69) for message propagation, we see that the messages. which are propagated in the hidden Markov model take the form. µzn−1→fn(zn−1) = µfn−1→zn−1(zn−1). µfn→zn(zn) =. fn(zn−1, zn)µzn−1→fn(zn−1). zn−1. (13.47). (13.48). These equations represent the propagation of messages forward along the chain and. are equivalent to the alpha recursions derived in the previous section, as we shall. now show. Note that because the variable nodes zn have only two neighbours, they. perform no computation.. We can eliminate µzn−1→fn(zn−1) from (13.48) using (13.47) to give a recur-. sion for the f → z messages of the form. µfn→zn(zn) =. fn(zn−1, zn)µfn−1→zn−1(zn−1).. (13.49). If we now recall the definition (13.46), and if we define. α(zn) = µfn→zn(zn). (13.50). then we obtain the alpha recursion given by (13.36). We also need to verify that. the quantities α(zn) are themselves equivalent to those defined previously. This. is easily done by using the initial condition (8.71) and noting that α(z1) is given. by h(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1) which is identical to (13.37). Because the initial α is. the same, and because they are iteratively computed using the same equation, all. subsequent α quantities must be the same.. Next we consider the messages that are propagated from the root node back to. the leaf node. These take the form. µfn+1→fn(zn) =. zn+1. fn+1(zn, zn+1)µfn+2→fn+1(zn+1). (13.51). where, as before, we have eliminated the messages of the type z → f since the. variable nodes perform no computation. Using the definition (13.46) to substitute. for fn+1(zn, zn+1), and defining. β(zn) = µfn+1→zn(zn). (13.52). 13.2. Hidden Markov Models. 627. we obtain the beta recursion given by (13.38). Again, we can verify that the beta. variables themselves are equivalent by noting that (8.70) implies that the initial mes-. sage send by the root variable node is µzN→fN (zN ) = 1, which is identical to the. initialization of β(zN ) given in Section 13.2.2.. The sum-product algorithm also specifies how to evaluate the marginals once all. the messages have been evaluated. In particular, the result (8.63) shows that the local. marginal at the node zn is given by the product of the incoming messages. Because. we have conditioned on the variables X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we are computing the. joint distribution. p(zn, X) = µfn→zn(zn)µfn+1→zn(zn) = α(zn)β(zn).. Dividing both sides by p(X), we then obtain. γ(zn) = p(zn, X). p(X). = α(zn)β(zn). p(X). (13.53). (13.54). Exercise 13.11. in agreement with (13.33). The result (13.43) can similarly be derived from (8.72).. "
226,13.2.4,Scaling factors,"There is an important issue that must be addressed before we can make use of the. forward backward algorithm in practice. From the recursion relation (13.36), we note. that at each step the new value α(zn) is obtained from the previous value α(zn−1). by multiplying by quantities p(zn|zn−1) and p(xn|zn). Because these probabilities. are often significantly less than unity, as we work our way forward along the chain,. the values of α(zn) can go to zero exponentially quickly. For moderate lengths of. chain (say 100 or so), the calculation of the α(zn) will soon exceed the dynamic. range of the computer, even if double precision floating point is used.. In the case of i.i.d. data, we implicitly circumvented this problem with the eval-. uation of likelihood functions by taking logarithms. Unfortunately, this will not help. here because we are forming sums of products of small numbers (we are in fact im-. plicitly summing over all possible paths through the lattice diagram of Figure 13.7).. We therefore work with re-scaled versions of α(zn) and β(zn) whose values remain. of order unity. As we shall see, the corresponding scaling factors cancel out when. we use these re-scaled quantities in the EM algorithm.. In (13.34), we defined α(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn) representing the joint distri-. bution of all the observations up to xn and the latent variable zn. Now we define a. normalized version of α given by. α(zn) = p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) =. α(zn). p(x1, . . . , xn). (13.55). which we expect to be well behaved numerically because it is a probability distribu-. tion over K variables for any value of n. In order to relate the scaled and original al-. pha variables, we introduce scaling factors defined by conditional distributions over. the observed variables. cn = p(xn|x1, . . . , xn−1).. (13.56). n. n. zn−1. N. N. n=1. m=n+1. zn+1. 628. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. From the product rule, we then have. p(x1, . . . , xn) =. cm. m=1. (13.57). and so. α(zn) = p(zn|x1, . . . , xn)p(x1, . . . , xn) =. cm. α(zn).. (13.58). m=1. We can then turn the recursion equation (13.36) for α into one for. α given by. cn. α(zn) = p(xn|zn). α(zn−1)p(zn|zn−1).. (13.59). α(zn),. Note that at each stage of the forward message passing phase, used to evaluate. we have to evaluate and store cn, which is easily done because it is the coefficient. that normalizes the right-hand side of (13.59) to give. We can similarly define re-scaled variables. α(zn).. β(zn) using. β(zn) =. cm. β(zn). (13.60). which will again remain within machine precision because, from (13.35), the quan-. tities. β(zn) are simply the ratio of two conditional probabilities. β(zn) =. p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn). p(xn+1, . . . , xN|x1, . . . , xn) .. (13.61). The recursion result (13.38) for β then gives the following recursion for the re-scaled. variables. cn+1. β(zn) =. β(zn+1)p(xn+1|zn+1)p(zn+1|zn).. (13.62). In applying this recursion relation, we make use of the scaling factors cn that were. previously computed in the α phase.. From (13.57), we see that the likelihood function can be found using. p(X) =. cn.. (13.63). Exercise 13.15. Similarly, using (13.33) and (13.43), together with (13.63), we see that the required. marginals are given by. γ(zn) =. α(zn). β(zn). ξ(zn−1, zn) = cn. α(zn−1)p(xn|zn)p(zn|z−1). β(zn).. (13.64). (13.65). Section 13.3. 13.2. Hidden Markov Models. 629. α(zn). β(zn) instead of using. Finally, we note that there is an alternative formulation of the forward-backward. algorithm (Jordan, 2007) in which the backward pass is defined by a recursion based. the quantities γ(zn) =. β(zn). This α–γ recursion. α(zn). requires that the forward pass be completed first so that all the quantities. are available for the backward pass, whereas the forward and backward passes of. the α–β algorithm can be done independently. Although these two algorithms have. comparable computational cost, the α–β version is the most commonly encountered. one in the case of hidden Markov models, whereas for linear dynamical systems a. recursion analogous to the α–γ form is more usual.. "
227,13.2.5,The Viterbi algorithm,"In many applications of hidden Markov models, the latent variables have some. meaningful interpretation, and so it is often of interest to find the most probable. sequence of hidden states for a given observation sequence. For instance in speech. recognition, we might wish to find the most probable phoneme sequence for a given. series of acoustic observations. Because the graph for the hidden Markov model is. a directed tree, this problem can be solved exactly using the max-sum algorithm.. We recall from our discussion in Section 8.4.5 that the problem of finding the most. probable sequence of latent states is not the same as that of finding the set of states. that are individually the most probable. The latter problem can be solved by first. running the forward-backward (sum-product) algorithm to find the latent variable. marginals γ(zn) and then maximizing each of these individually (Duda et al., 2001).. However, the set of such states will not, in general, correspond to the most probable. sequence of states. In fact, this set of states might even represent a sequence having. zero probability, if it so happens that two successive states, which in isolation are. individually the most probable, are such that the transition matrix element connecting. them is zero.. In practice, we are usually interested in finding the most probable sequence of. states, and this can be solved efficiently using the max-sum algorithm, which in the. context of hidden Markov models is known as the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967).. Note that the max-sum algorithm works with log probabilities and so there is no. need to use re-scaled variables as was done with the forward-backward algorithm.. Figure 13.16 shows a fragment of the hidden Markov model expanded as lattice. diagram. As we have already noted, the number of possible paths through the lattice. grows exponentially with the length of the chain. The Viterbi algorithm searches this. space of paths efficiently to find the most probable path with a computational cost. that grows only linearly with the length of the chain.. As with the sum-product algorithm, we first represent the hidden Markov model. as a factor graph, as shown in Figure 13.15. Again, we treat the variable node zN. as the root, and pass messages to the root starting with the leaf nodes. Using the. results (8.93) and (8.94), we see that the messages passed in the max-sum algorithm. are given by. µzn→fn+1(zn) = µfn→zn(zn). µfn+1→zn+1(zn+1) = max. zn. ln fn+1(zn, zn+1) + µzn→fn+1(zn).

For. any given path, the corresponding probability is. given by the product of the elements of the tran-. sition matrix Ajk, corresponding to the probabil-. ities p(zn+1|zn) for each segment of the path,. along with the emission densities p(xn|k) asso-. ciated with each node on the path.. k = 1. k = 2. k = 3. n − 2. n − 1. n. n + 1. If we eliminate µzn→fn+1(zn) between these two equations, and make use of (13.46),. we obtain a recursion for the f → z messages of the form. ω(zn+1) = ln p(xn+1|zn+1) + max. zn {ln p(x+1|zn) + ω(zn)}. (13.68). where we have introduced the notation ω(zn) ≡ µfn→zn(zn).. From (8.95) and (8.96), these messages are initialized using. ω(z1) = ln p(z1) + ln p(x1|z1).. (13.69). where we have used (13.45). Note that to keep the notation uncluttered, we omit. the dependence on the model parameters θ that are held fixed when finding the most. probable sequence.. Exercise 13.16. The Viterbi algorithm can also be derived directly from the definition (13.6) of. the joint distribution by taking the logarithm and then exchanging maximizations. and summations. It is easily seen that the quantities ω(zn) have the probabilistic. interpretation. ω(zn) = max. p(x1, . . . , xn, z1, . . . , zn).. (13.70). z1,...,zn−1. Once we have completed the final maximization over zN , we will obtain the. value of the joint distribution p(X, Z) corresponding to the most probable path. We. also wish to find the sequence of latent variable values that corresponds to this path.. To do this, we simply make use of the back-tracking procedure discussed in Sec-. tion 8.4.5. Specifically, we note that the maximization over zn must be performed. for each of the K possible values of zn+1. Suppose we keep a record of the values. of zn that correspond to the maxima for each value of the K values of zn+1. Let us. denote this function by ψ(kn) where k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Once we have passed mes-. sages to the end of the chain and found the most probable state of zN , we can then. use this function to backtrack along the chain by applying it recursively. n = ψ(kmax. kmax. n+1)..

Naively, we. could consider explicitly all of the exponentially many paths through the lattice,. evaluate the probability for each, and then select the path having the highest proba-. bility. However, we notice that we can make a dramatic saving in computational cost. as follows. Suppose that for each path we evaluate its probability by summing up. products of transition and emission probabilities as we work our way forward along. each path through the lattice. Consider a particular time step n and a particular state. k at that time step. There will be many possible paths converging on the correspond-. ing node in the lattice diagram. However, we need only retain that particular path. that so far has the highest probability. Because there are K states at time step n, we. need to keep track of K such paths. At time step n + 1, there will be K 2 possible. paths to consider, comprising K possible paths leading out of each of the K current. states, but again we need only retain K of these corresponding to the best path for. each state at time n+1. When we reach the final time step N we will discover which. state corresponds to the overall most probable path. Because there is a unique path. coming into that state we can trace the path back to step N − 1 to see what state it. occupied at that time, and so on back through the lattice to the state n = 1.. "
228,13.2.6,Extensions of the hidden Markov model,"The basic hidden Markov model, along with the standard training algorithm. based on maximum likelihood, has been extended in numerous ways to meet the. requirements of particular applications. Here we discuss a few of the more important. examples.. We see from the digits example in Figure 13.11 that hidden Markov models can. be quite poor generative models for the data, because many of the synthetic digits. look quite unrepresentative of the training data. If the goal is sequence classifica-. tion, there can be significant benefit in determining the parameters of hidden Markov. models using discriminative rather than maximum likelihood techniques. Suppose. we have a training set of R observation sequences Xr, where r = 1, . . . , R, each of. which is labelled according to its class m, where m = 1, . . . , M. For each class, we. have a separate hidden Markov model with its own parameters θm, and we treat the. problem of determining the parameter values as a standard classification problem in. which we optimize the cross-entropy. where p(m) is the prior probability of class m. Optimization of this cost function. is more complex than for maximum likelihood (Kapadia, 1998), and in particular. Using Bayes’ theorem this can be expressed in terms of the sequence probabilities. associated with the hidden Markov models. ln p(mr|Xr).. ln. r=1. p(Xr|θr)p(mr). l=1 p(Xr|θl)p(lr). M. (13.72). (13.73). 632. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.17 Section of an autoregressive hidden. Markov model, in which the distribution. of the observation xn depends on a. subset of the previous observations as. well as on the hidden state zn.. In this. example, the distribution of xn depends. on the two previous observations xn−1. and xn−2.. zn−1. xn−1. zn. xn. zn+1. xn+1. requires that every training sequence be evaluated under each of the models in or-. der to compute the denominator in (13.73). Hidden Markov models, coupled with. discriminative training methods, are widely used in speech recognition (Kapadia,. 1998).. A significant weakness of the hidden Markov model is the way in which it rep-. resents the distribution of times for which the system remains in a given state. To see. the problem, note that the probability that a sequence sampled from a given hidden. Markov model will spend precisely T steps in state k and then make a transition to a. different state is given by. p(T ) = (Akk)T (1 − Akk) ∝ exp (−T ln Akk). (13.74). T. and so is an exponentially decaying function of T . For many applications, this will. be a very unrealistic model of state duration. The problem can be resolved by mod-. elling state duration directly in which the diagonal coefficients Akk are all set to zero,. and each state k is explicitly associated with a probability distribution p(T|k) of pos-. sible duration times. From a generative point of view, when a state k is entered, a. value T representing the number of time steps that the system will remain in state k. is then drawn from p(T|k). The model then emits T values of the observed variable. xt, which are generally assumed to be independent so that the corresponding emis-. t=1 p(xt|k). This approach requires some straightforward. sion density is simply. modifications to the EM optimization procedure (Rabiner, 1989).. Another limitation of the standard HMM is that it is poor at capturing long-. range correlations between the observed variables (i.e., between variables that are. separated by many time steps) because these must be mediated via the first-order. Markov chain of hidden states. Longer-range effects could in principle be included. by adding extra links to the graphical model of Figure 13.5. One way to address this. is to generalize the HMM to give the autoregressive hidden Markov model (Ephraim. et al., 1989), an example of which is shown in Figure 13.17. For discrete observa-. tions, this corresponds to expanded tables of conditional probabilities for the emis-. sion distributions. In the case of a Gaussian emission density, we can use the linear-. Gaussian framework in which the conditional distribution for xn given the values. of the previous observations, and the value of zn, is a Gaussian whose mean is a. linear combination of the values of the conditioning variables. Clearly the number. of additional links in the graph must be limited to avoid an excessive the number of. free parameters. In the example shown in Figure 13.17, each observation depends on. Figure 13.18 Example of an input-output hidden. Markov model.. In this case, both the. emission probabilities and the transition. probabilities depend on the values of a. sequence of observations u1, . . . , uN .. 13.2. Hidden Markov Models. 633. un−1. zn−1. xn−1. un. zn. xn. un+1. zn+1. xn+1. the two preceding observed variables as well as on the hidden state. Although this. graph looks messy, we can again appeal to d-separation to see that in fact it still has. a simple probabilistic structure. In particular, if we imagine conditioning on zn we. see that, as with the standard HMM, the values of zn−1 and zn+1 are independent,. corresponding to the conditional independence property (13.5). This is easily veri-. fied by noting that every path from node zn−1 to node zn+1 passes through at least. one observed node that is head-to-tail with respect to that path. As a consequence,. we can again use a forward-backward recursion in the E step of the EM algorithm to. determine the posterior distributions of the latent variables in a computational time. that is linear in the length of the chain. Similarly, the M step involves only a minor. modification of the standard M-step equations. In the case of Gaussian emission. densities this involves estimating the parameters using the standard linear regression. equations, discussed in Chapter 3.. We have seen that the autoregressive HMM appears as a natural extension of the. standard HMM when viewed as a graphical model. In fact the probabilistic graphical. modelling viewpoint motivates a plethora of different graphical structures based on. the HMM. Another example is the input-output hidden Markov model (Bengio and. Frasconi, 1995), in which we have a sequence of observed variables u1, . . . , uN , in. addition to the output variables x1, . . . , xN , whose values influence either the dis-. tribution of latent variables or output variables, or both. An example is shown in. Figure 13.18. This extends the HMM framework to the domain of supervised learn-. ing for sequential data. It is again easy to show, through the use of the d-separation. criterion, that the Markov property (13.5) for the chain of latent variables still holds.. To verify this, simply note that there is only one path from node zn−1 to node zn+1. and this is head-to-tail with respect to the observed node zn. This conditional inde-. pendence property again allows the formulation of a computationally efficient learn-. ing algorithm. In particular, we can determine the parameters θ of the model by. maximizing the likelihood function L(θ) = p(X|U, θ) where U is a matrix whose. rows are given by uT. n. As a consequence of the conditional independence property. (13.5) this likelihood function can be maximized efficiently using an EM algorithm. in which the E step involves forward and backward recursions.. Another variant of the HMM worthy of mention is the factorial hidden Markov. model (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997), in which there are multiple independent. Exercise 13.18. 634. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. Figure 13.19 A factorial hidden Markov model com-. prising two Markov chains of latent vari-. ables. For continuous observed variables. x, one possible choice of emission model. is a linear-Gaussian density in which the. mean of the Gaussian is a linear combi-. nation of the states of the corresponding. latent variables.. z(2). n−1. z(1). n−1. xn−1. z(2). n. z(1). n. z(2). n+1. z(1). n+1. xn. xn+1. Markov chains of latent variables, and the distribution of the observed variable at. a given time step is conditional on the states of all of the corresponding latent vari-. ables at that same time step. Figure 13.19 shows the corresponding graphical model.. The motivation for considering factorial HMM can be seen by noting that in order to. represent, say, 10 bits of information at a given time step, a standard HMM would. need K = 210 = 1024 latent states, whereas a factorial HMM could make use of 10. binary latent chains. The primary disadvantage of factorial HMMs, however, lies in. the additional complexity of training them. The M step for the factorial HMM model. is straightforward. However, observation of the x variables introduces dependencies. between the latent chains, leading to difficulties with the E step. This can be seen. by noting that in Figure 13.19, the variables z(1). n are connected by a path. which is head-to-head at node xn and hence they are not d-separated. The exact E. step for this model does not correspond to running forward and backward recursions. along the M Markov chains independently. This is confirmed by noting that the key. conditional independence property (13.5) is not satisfied for the individual Markov. chains in the factorial HMM model, as is shown using d-separation in Figure 13.20.. Now suppose that there are M chains of hidden nodes and for simplicity suppose. that all latent variables have the same number K of states. Then one approach would. be to note that there are KM combinations of latent variables at a given time step. n and z(2). Figure 13.20 Example of a path, highlighted in green,. which is head-to-head at the observed. nodes xn−1 and xn+1, and head-to-tail. at the unobserved nodes z(2). n and. z(2). n+1. Thus the path is not blocked and. so the conditional independence property. (13.5) does not hold for the individual la-. tent chains of the factorial HMM model.. As a consequence, there is no efficient. exact E step for this model.. n−1, z(2). z(2). n−1. z(1). n−1. xn−1. z(2). n. z(1). n. z(2). n+1. z(1). n+1. xn. xn+1. Section 10.1. "
229,13.3,Linear Dynamical Systems,"635. and so we can transform the model into an equivalent standard HMM having a single. chain of latent variables each of which has KM latent states. We can then run the. standard forward-backward recursions in the E step. This has computational com-. plexity O(N K 2M ) that is exponential in the number M of latent chains and so will. be intractable for anything other than small values of M. One solution would be. to use sampling methods (discussed in Chapter 11). As an elegant deterministic al-. ternative, Ghahramani and Jordan (1997) exploited variational inference techniques. to obtain a tractable algorithm for approximate inference. This can be done using. a simple variational posterior distribution that is fully factorized with respect to the. latent variables, or alternatively by using a more powerful approach in which the. variational distribution is described by independent Markov chains corresponding to. the chains of latent variables in the original model. In the latter case, the variational. inference algorithms involves running independent forward and backward recursions. along each chain, which is computationally efficient and yet is also able to capture. correlations between variables within the same chain.. Clearly, there are many possible probabilistic structures that can be constructed. according to the needs of particular applications. Graphical models provide a general. technique for motivating, describing, and analysing such structures, and variational. methods provide a powerful framework for performing inference in those models for. which exact solution is intractable.. 13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems. In order to motivate the concept of linear dynamical systems, let us consider the. following simple problem, which often arises in practical settings. Suppose we wish. to measure the value of an unknown quantity z using a noisy sensor that returns a. observation x representing the value of z plus zero-mean Gaussian noise. Given a. single measurement, our best guess for z is to assume that z = x. However, we. can improve our estimate for z by taking lots of measurements and averaging them,. because the random noise terms will tend to cancel each other. Now let’s make the. situation more complicated by assuming that we wish to measure a quantity z that. is changing over time. We can take regular measurements of x so that at some point. in time we have obtained x1, . . . , xN and we wish to find the corresponding values. z1, . . . , xN . If we simply average the measurements, the error due to random noise. will be reduced, but unfortunately we will just obtain a single averaged estimate, in. which we have averaged over the changing value of z, thereby introducing a new. source of error.. Intuitively, we could imagine doing a bit better as follows. To estimate the value. of zN , we take only the most recent few measurements, say xN−L, . . . , xN and just. average these. If z is changing slowly, and the random noise level in the sensor is. high, it would make sense to choose a relatively long window of observations to. average. Conversely, if the signal is changing quickly, and the noise levels are small,. we might be better just to use xN directly as our estimate of zN . Perhaps we could. do even better if we take a weighted average, in which more recent measurements. 636. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. make a greater contribution than less recent ones.. Although this sort of intuitive argument seems plausible, it does not tell us how. to form a weighted average, and any sort of hand-crafted weighing is hardly likely. to be optimal. Fortunately, we can address problems such as this much more sys-. tematically by defining a probabilistic model that captures the time evolution and. measurement processes and then applying the inference and learning methods devel-. oped in earlier chapters. Here we shall focus on a widely used model known as a. linear dynamical system.. As we have seen, the HMM corresponds to the state space model shown in. Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete but with arbitrary emission. probability distributions. This graph of course describes a much broader class of. probability distributions, all of which factorize according to (13.6). We now consider. extensions to other distributions for the latent variables. In particular, we consider. continuous latent variables in which the summations of the sum-product algorithm. become integrals. The general form of the inference algorithms will, however, be. the same as for the hidden Markov model. It is interesting to note that, historically,. hidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems were developed independently.. Once they are both expressed as graphical models, however, the deep relationship. between them immediately becomes apparent.. One key requirement is that we retain an efficient algorithm for inference which. is linear in the length of the chain. This requires that, for instance, when we take. α(zn−1), representing the posterior probability of zn given observations. a quantity. x1, . . . , xn, and multiply by the transition probability p(zn|zn−1) and the emission. probability p(xn|zn) and then marginalize over zn−1, we obtain a distribution over. α(zn−1). That is to say, the. zn that is of the same functional form as that over. distribution must not become more complex at each stage, but must only change in. its parameter values. Not surprisingly, the only distributions that have this property. of being closed under multiplication are those belonging to the exponential family.. Here we consider the most important example from a practical perspective,. which is the Gaussian. In particular, we consider a linear-Gaussian state space model. so that the latent variables {zn}, as well as the observed variables {xn}, are multi-. variate Gaussian distributions whose means are linear functions of the states of their. parents in the graph. We have seen that a directed graph of linear-Gaussian units. is equivalent to a joint Gaussian distribution over all of the variables. Furthermore,. α(zn) are also Gaussian, so that the functional form of the mes-. marginals such as. sages is preserved and we will obtain an efficient inference algorithm. By contrast,. suppose that the emission densities p(xn|zn) comprise a mixture of K Gaussians. α(z1) is Gaussian, the. each of which has a mean that is linear in zn. Then even if. α(z3) will be a mixture of K 2. quantity. Gaussians, and so on, and exact inference will not be of practical value.. α(z2) will be a mixture of K Gaussians,. We have seen that the hidden Markov model can be viewed as an extension of. the mixture models of Chapter 9 to allow for sequential correlations in the data.. In a similar way, we can view the linear dynamical system as a generalization of the. continuous latent variable models of Chapter 12 such as probabilistic PCA and factor. analysis. Each pair of nodes {zn, xn} represents a linear-Gaussian latent variable. 13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems. 637. model for that particular observation. However, the latent variables {zn} are no. longer treated as independent but now form a Markov chain.. Because the model is represented by a tree-structured directed graph, inference. problems can be solved efficiently using the sum-product algorithm. The forward re-. cursions, analogous to the α messages of the hidden Markov model, are known as the. Kalman filter equations (Kalman, 1960; Zarchan and Musoff, 2005), and the back-. ward recursions, analogous to the β messages, are known as the Kalman smoother. equations, or the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) equations (Rauch et al., 1965). The. Kalman filter is widely used in many real-time tracking applications.. Because the linear dynamical system is a linear-Gaussian model, the joint distri-. bution over all variables, as well as all marginals and conditionals, will be Gaussian.. It follows that the sequence of individually most probable latent variable values is. the same as the most probable latent sequence. There is thus no need to consider the. analogue of the Viterbi algorithm for the linear dynamical system.. Because the model has linear-Gaussian conditional distributions, we can write. the transition and emission distributions in the general form. p(zn|zn−1) = N (zn|Azn−1, Γ). p(xn|zn) = N (xn|Czn, Σ).. The initial latent variable also has a Gaussian distribution which we write as. p(z1) = N (z1|µ0, V0).. (13.75). (13.76). (13.77). Exercise 13.19. Exercise 13.24. Note that in order to simplify the notation, we have omitted additive constant terms. from the means of the Gaussians. In fact, it is straightforward to include them if. desired. Traditionally, these distributions are more commonly expressed in an equiv-. alent form in terms of noisy linear equations given by. zn = Azn−1 + wn. xn = Czn + vn. z1 = µ0 + u. (13.78). (13.79). (13.80). where the noise terms have the distributions. w ∼ N (w|0, Γ). v ∼ N (v|0, Σ). u ∼ N (u|0, V0).. (13.81). (13.82). (13.83). The parameters of the model, denoted by θ = {A, Γ, C, Σ, µ0, V0}, can be. determined using maximum likelihood through the EM algorithm. In the E step, we. need to solve the inference problem of determining the local posterior marginals for. the latent variables, which can be solved efficiently using the sum-product algorithm,. as we discuss in the next section.. 638. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. "
230,13.3.1,Inference in LDS,"We now turn to the problem of finding the marginal distributions for the latent. variables conditional on the observation sequence. For given parameter settings, we. also wish to make predictions of the next latent state zn and of the next observation. xn conditioned on the observed data x1, . . . , xn−1 for use in real-time applications.. These inference problems can be solved efficiently using the sum-product algorithm,. which in the context of the linear dynamical system gives rise to the Kalman filter. and Kalman smoother equations.. It is worth emphasizing that because the linear dynamical system is a linear-. Gaussian model, the joint distribution over all latent and observed variables is simply. a Gaussian, and so in principle we could solve inference problems by using the. standard results derived in previous chapters for the marginals and conditionals of a. multivariate Gaussian. The role of the sum-product algorithm is to provide a more. efficient way to perform such computations.. Linear dynamical systems have the identical factorization, given by (13.6), to. hidden Markov models, and are again described by the factor graphs in Figures 13.14. and 13.15. Inference algorithms therefore take precisely the same form except that. summations over latent variables are replaced by integrations. We begin by consid-. ering the forward equations in which we treat zN as the root node, and propagate. messages from the leaf node h(z1) to the root. From (13.77), the initial message will. be Gaussian, and because each of the factors is Gaussian, all subsequent messages. will also be Gaussian. By convention, we shall propagate messages that are nor-. malized marginal distributions corresponding to p(zn|x1, . . . , xn), which we denote. by. (13.84). α(zn) given by. This is precisely analogous to the propagation of scaled variables. (13.59) in the discrete case of the hidden Markov model, and so the recursion equa-. tion now takes the form. α(zn) = N (zn|µn, Vn).. cn. α(zn) = p(xn|zn). α(zn−1)p(zn|zn−1) dzn−1.. (13.85). Substituting for the conditionals p(zn|zn−1) and p(xn|zn), using (13.75) and (13.76),. respectively, and making use of (13.84), we see that (13.85) becomes. cnN (zn|µn, Vn) = N (xn|Czn, Σ). N (zn|Azn−1, Γ)N (zn−1|µn−1, Vn−1) dzn−1.. (13.86). Here we are supposing that µn−1 and Vn−1 are known, and by evaluating the inte-. gral in (13.86), we wish to determine values for µn and Vn. The integral is easily. evaluated by making use of the result (2.115), from which it follows that. N (zn|Azn−1, Γ)N (zn−1|µn−1, Vn−1) dzn−1. = N (zn|Aµn−1, Pn−1). (13.87). 13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems. 639. (13.88). (13.89). (13.90). (13.91). where we have defined. Pn−1 = AVn−1AT + Γ.. We can now combine this result with the first factor on the right-hand side of (13.86). by making use of (2.115) and (2.116) to give. µn = Aµn−1 + Kn(xn − CAµn−1). Vn = (I − KnC)Pn−1. cn = N (xn|CAµn−1, CPn−1CT + Σ).. Here we have made use of the matrix inverse identities (C.5) and (C.7) and also. defined the Kalman gain matrix. Kn = Pn−1CT. (13.92). Thus, given the values of µn−1 and Vn−1, together with the new observation xn,. we can evaluate the Gaussian marginal for zn having mean µn and covariance Vn,. as well as the normalization coefficient cn.. CPn−1CT + Σ. The initial conditions for these recursion equations are obtained from. −1. (13.93). Because p(z1) is given by (13.77), and p(x1|z1) is given by (13.76), we can again. make use of (2.115) to calculate c1 and (2.116) to calculate µ1 and V1 giving. α(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1).. c1. µ1 = µ0 + K1(x1 − Cµ0). V1 = (I − K1C)V0. c1 = N (x1|Cµ0, CV0CT + Σ). K1 = V0CT. CV0CT + Σ. −1. (13.94). (13.95). (13.96). (13.97). where. Similarly, the likelihood function for the linear dynamical system is given by (13.63). in which the factors cn are found using the Kalman filtering equations.. We can interpret the steps involved in going from the posterior marginal over. zn−1 to the posterior marginal over zn as follows.. In (13.89), we can view the. quantity Aµn−1 as the prediction of the mean over zn obtained by simply taking the. mean over zn−1 and projecting it forward one step using the transition probability. matrix A. This predicted mean would give a predicted observation for xn given by. CAzn−1 obtained by applying the emission probability matrix C to the predicted. hidden state mean. We can view the update equation (13.89) for the mean of the. hidden variable distribution as taking the predicted mean Aµn−1 and then adding. a correction that is proportional to the error xn − CAzn−1 between the predicted. observation and the actual observation. The coefficient of this correction is given by. the Kalman gain matrix. Thus we can view the Kalman filter as a process of making. successive predictions and then correcting these predictions in the light of the new. observations. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 13.21.. 640. 13. SEQUENTIAL DATA. zn−1. zn. zn. Figure 13.21 The linear dynamical system can be viewed as a sequence of steps in which increasing un-. certainty in the state variable due to diffusion is compensated by the arrival of new data. In the left-hand plot,. the blue curve shows the distribution p(zn−1|x1, . . . , xn−1), which incorporates all the data up to step n − 1.. The diffusion arising from the nonzero variance of the transition probability p(zn|zn−1) gives the distribution. p(zn|x1, . . . , xn−1), shown in red in the centre plot. Note that this is broader and shifted relative to the blue curve. (which is shown dashed in the centre plot for comparison). The next data observation xn contributes through the. emission density p(xn|zn), which is shown as a function of zn in green on the right-hand plot. Note that this is not. a density with respect to zn and so is not normalized to one. Inclusion of this new data point leads to a revised. distribution p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) for the state density shown in blue. We see that observation of the data has shifted. and narrowed the distribution compared to p(zn|x1, . . . , xn−1) (which is shown in dashed in the right-hand plot. for comparison).. Exercise 13.27. Exercise 13.28. If we consider a situation in which the measurement noise is small compared. to the rate at which the latent variable is evolving, then we find that the posterior. distribution for zn depends only on the current measurement xn, in accordance with. the intuition from our simple example at the start of the section. Similarly, if the. latent variable is evolving slowly relative to the observation noise level, we find that. the posterior mean for zn is obtained by averaging all of the measurements obtained. up to that time.. One of the most important applications of the Kalman filter is to tracking, and. this is illustrated using a simple example of an object moving in two dimensions in. Figure 13.22.. So far, we have solved the inference problem of finding the posterior marginal. for a node zn given observations from x1 up to xn. Next we turn to the problem of. finding the marginal for a node zn given all observations x1 to xN . For temporal. data, this corresponds to the inclusion of future as well as past observations. Al-. though this cannot be used for real-time prediction, it plays a key role in learning the. parameters of the model. By analogy with the hidden Markov model, this problem. can be solved by propagating messages from node xN back to node x1 and com-. bining this information with that obtained during the forward message passing stage. used to compute the. α(zn).. In the LDS literature, it is usual to formulate this backward recursion in terms. β(zn). Because γ(zn) must also be. β(zn) rather than in terms of. of γ(zn) =.

231,13.3.2,Learning in LDS,"So far, we have considered the inference problem for linear dynamical systems,. assuming that the model parameters θ = {A, Γ, C, Σ, µ0, V0} are known. Next, we. consider the determination of these parameters using maximum likelihood (Ghahra-. mani and Hinton, 1996b). Because the model has latent variables, this can be ad-. dressed using the EM algorithm, which was discussed in general terms in Chapter 9.. We can derive the EM algorithm for the linear dynamical system as follows. Let. us denote the estimated parameter values at some particular cycle of the algorithm. by θold. For these parameter values, we can run the inference algorithm to determine. the posterior distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, θold), or more precisely those. local posterior marginals that are required in the M step.. In particular, we shall. require the following expectations. E [zn] =. µn. E. znzT. E. n−1. znzT. n. = Jn−1. Vn +. Vn +. µT. n. µn. µT. µn. n−1. (13.105). (13.106).

(13.109). In the M step, this function is maximized with respect to the components of θ.. Consider first the parameters µ0 and V0. If we substitute for p(z1|µ0, V0) in.

"
232,13.3.3,Extensions of LDS,"As with the hidden Markov model, there is considerable interest in extending. the basic linear dynamical system in order to increase its capabilities. Although the. assumption of a linear-Gaussian model leads to efficient algorithms for inference. and learning, it also implies that the marginal distribution of the observed variables. is simply a Gaussian, which represents a significant limitation. One simple extension. of the linear dynamical system is to use a Gaussian mixture as the initial distribution. for z1.. If this mixture has K components, then the forward recursion equations. (13.85) will lead to a mixture of K Gaussians over each hidden variable zn, and so. the model is again tractable.. For many applications, the Gaussian emission density is a poor approximation.. If instead we try to use a mixture of K Gaussians as the emission density, then the. α(z1) will also be a mixture of K Gaussians. However, from (13.85) the. posterior. α(zn). α(z2) will comprise a mixture of K 2 Gaussians, and so on, with. posterior. being given by a mixture of K n Gaussians. Thus the number of components grows. exponentially with the length of the chain, and so this model is impractical.. More generally, introducing transition or emission models that depart from the. linear-Gaussian (or other exponential family) model leads to an intractable infer-. ence problem. We can make deterministic approximations such as assumed den-. sity filtering or expectation propagation, or we can make use of sampling methods,. as discussed in Section 13.3.4. One widely used approach is to make a Gaussian. approximation by linearizing around the mean of the predicted distribution, which. gives rise to the extended Kalman filter (Zarchan and Musoff, 2005).. As with hidden Markov models, we can develop interesting extensions of the ba-. sic linear dynamical system by expanding its graphical representation. For example,. the switching state space model (Ghahramani and Hinton, 1998) can be viewed as. a combination of the hidden Markov model with a set of linear dynamical systems.. The model has multiple Markov chains of continuous linear-Gaussian latent vari-. ables, each of which is analogous to the latent chain of the linear dynamical system. discussed earlier, together with a Markov chain of discrete variables of the form used. in a hidden Markov model. The output at each time step is determined by stochas-. tically choosing one of the continuous latent chains, using the state of the discrete. latent variable as a switch, and then emitting an observation from the corresponding. conditional output distribution. Exact inference in this model is intractable, but vari-. ational methods lead to an efficient inference scheme involving forward-backward. recursions along each of the continuous and discrete Markov chains independently.. Note that, if we consider multiple chains of discrete latent variables, and use one as. the switch to select from the remainder, we obtain an analogous model having only. discrete latent variables known as the switching hidden Markov model.. l=1. L. Chapter 11. 13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems. 645. "
233,13.3.4,Particle filters,"For dynamical systems which do not have a linear-Gaussian, for example, if. they use a non-Gaussian emission density, we can turn to sampling methods in order. to find a tractable inference algorithm. In particular, we can apply the sampling-. importance-resampling formalism of Section 11.1.5 to obtain a sequential Monte. Carlo algorithm known as the particle filter.. Consider the class of distributions represented by the graphical model in Fig-. ure 13.5, and suppose we are given the observed values Xn = (x1, . . . , xn) and. we wish to draw L samples from the posterior distribution p(zn|Xn). Using Bayes’. theorem, we have. f(zn)p(zn|Xn) dzn. f(zn)p(zn|xn, Xn−1) dzn. f(zn)p(xn|zn)p(zn|Xn−1) dzn. p(xn|zn)p(zn|Xn−1) dzn. E[f(zn)] =. w(l). n f(z(l). n ). (13.117). where {z(l). n } is a set of samples drawn from p(zn|Xn−1) and we have made use of. the conditional independence property p(xn|zn, Xn−1) = p(xn|zn), which follows. from the graph in Figure 13.5. The sampling weights {w(l). n } are defined by. w(l). n =. p(xn|z(l). n ). m=1 p(xn|z(m). n ). L. (13.118). l w(l). where the same samples are used in the numerator as in the denominator. Thus the. posterior distribution p(zn|xn) is represented by the set of samples {z(l). n } together. n }. Note that these weights satisfy 0 � w(l). with the corresponding weights {w(l). n 1. and. Because we wish to find a sequential sampling scheme, we shall suppose that. a set of samples and weights have been obtained at time step n, and that we have. subsequently observed the value of xn+1, and we wish to find the weights and sam-. ples at time step n + 1. We first sample from the distribution p(zn+1|Xn). This is. n = 1.. p(zn+1|Xn) =. p(zn+1|zn, Xn)p(zn|Xn) dzn. p(zn+1|zn)p(zn|Xn) dzn. p(zn+1|zn)p(zn|xn, Xn−1) dzn. p(zn+1|zn)p(xn|zn)p(zn|Xn−1) dzn. p(xn|zn)p(zn|Xn−1) dzn. n p(zn+1|z(l). n ). w(l). l.

The distribution given by (13.119) is a mixture distribution, and samples. can be drawn by choosing a component l with probability given by the mixing coef-. ficients w(l) and then drawing a sample from the corresponding component.. In summary, we can view each step of the particle filter algorithm as comprising. two stages. At time step n, we have a sample representation of the posterior dis-. n } with corresponding weights {w(l). tribution p(zn|Xn) expressed as samples {z(l). n }.. This can be viewed as a mixture representation of the form (13.119). To obtain the. corresponding representation for the next time step, we first draw L samples from. the mixture distribution (13.119), and then for each sample we use the new obser-. vation xn+1 to evaluate the corresponding weights w(l). n+1). This is. illustrated, for the case of a single variable z, in Figure 13.23.. n+1 ∝ p(xn+1|z(l). The particle filtering, or sequential Monte Carlo, approach has appeared in the. literature under various names including the bootstrap filter (Gordon et al., 1993),. survival of the fittest (Kanazawa et al., 1995), and the condensation algorithm (Isard. and Blake, 1998)..

234,14,Combining Models,"In earlier chapters, we have explored a range of different models for solving classifi-. cation and regression problems. It is often found that improved performance can be. obtained by combining multiple models together in some way, instead of just using. a single model in isolation. For instance, we might train L different models and then. make predictions using the average of the predictions made by each model. Such. combinations of models are sometimes called committees. In Section 14.2, we dis-. cuss ways to apply the committee concept in practice, and we also give some insight. into why it can sometimes be an effective procedure.. One important variant of the committee method, known as boosting, involves. training multiple models in sequence in which the error function used to train a par-. ticular model depends on the performance of the previous models. This can produce. substantial improvements in performance compared to the use of a single model and. is discussed in Section 14.3.. Instead of averaging the predictions of a set of models, an alternative form of. 653. k=1. K. model combination is to select one of the models to make the prediction, in which. the choice of model is a function of the input variables. Thus different models be-. come responsible for making predictions in different regions of input space. One. widely used framework of this kind is known as a decision tree in which the selec-. tion process can be described as a sequence of binary selections corresponding to. the traversal of a tree structure and is discussed in Section 14.4. In this case, the. individual models are generally chosen to be very simple, and the overall flexibility. of the model arises from the input-dependent selection process. Decision trees can. be applied to both classification and regression problems.. One limitation of decision trees is that the division of input space is based on. hard splits in which only one model is responsible for making predictions for any. given value of the input variables. The decision process can be softened by moving. to a probabilistic framework for combining models, as discussed in Section 14.5. For. example, if we have a set of K models for a conditional distribution p(t|x, k) where. x is the input variable, t is the target variable, and k = 1, . . . , K indexes the model,. then we can form a probabilistic mixture of the form. p(t|x) =. πk(x)p(t|x, k). (14.1). in which πk(x) = p(k|x) represent the input-dependent mixing coefficients. Such. models can be viewed as mixture distributions in which the component densities, as. well as the mixing coefficients, are conditioned on the input variables and are known. as mixtures of experts. They are closely related to the mixture density network model. discussed in Section 5.6.. 654. 14. COMBINING MODELS. "
235,14.1,Bayesian Model Averaging,"Section 9.2. It is important to distinguish between model combination methods and Bayesian. model averaging, as the two are often confused. To understand the difference, con-. sider the example of density estimation using a mixture of Gaussians in which several. Gaussian components are combined probabilistically. The model contains a binary. latent variable z that indicates which component of the mixture is responsible for. generating the corresponding data point. Thus the model is specified in terms of a. joint distribution. (14.2). and the corresponding density over the observed variable x is obtained by marginal-. izing over the latent variable. p(x, z). p(x) =. p(x, z).. z. (14.3). N. N. k=1. K. H. In the case of our Gaussian mixture example, this leads to a distribution of the form. "
236,14.2,Committees,"655. p(x) =. πkN (x|µk, Σk). (14.4). with the usual interpretation of the symbols. This is an example of model combi-. nation. For independent, identically distributed data, we can use (14.3) to write the. marginal probability of a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN} in the form. p(X) =. n=1. p(xn) =. p(xn, zn). (14.5). n=1. zn. Thus we see that each observed data point xn has a corresponding latent variable zn.. Now suppose we have several different models indexed by h = 1, . . . , H with. prior probabilities p(h). For instance one model might be a mixture of Gaussians and. another model might be a mixture of Cauchy distributions. The marginal distribution. over the data set is given by. p(X) =. p(X|h)p(h).. h=1. (14.6). This is an example of Bayesian model averaging. The interpretation of this summa-. tion over h is that just one model is responsible for generating the whole data set,. and the probability distribution over h simply reflects our uncertainty as to which. model that is. As the size of the data set increases, this uncertainty reduces, and. the posterior probabilities p(h|X) become increasingly focussed on just one of the. models.. This highlights the key difference between Bayesian model averaging and model. combination, because in Bayesian model averaging the whole data set is generated. by a single model. By contrast, when we combine multiple models, as in (14.5), we. see that different data points within the data set can potentially be generated from. different values of the latent variable z and hence by different components.. Although we have considered the marginal probability p(X), the same consid-. erations apply for the predictive density p(x|X) or for conditional distributions such. as p(t|x, X, T).. Exercise 14.1. 14.2. Committees. Section 3.2. The simplest way to construct a committee is to average the predictions of a set of. individual models. Such a procedure can be motivated from a frequentist perspective. by considering the trade-off between bias and variance, which decomposes the er-. ror due to a model into the bias component that arises from differences between the. model and the true function to be predicted, and the variance component that repre-. sents the sensitivity of the model to the individual data points. Recall from Figure 3.5. 1. M. Ex. m=1. M. M. M. M. m=1. 1. M. 1. M. m=1. 1. M. 2. 656. 14. COMBINING MODELS. that when we trained multiple polynomials using the sinusoidal data, and then aver-. aged the resulting functions, the contribution arising from the variance term tended to. cancel, leading to improved predictions. When we averaged a set of low-bias mod-. els (corresponding to higher order polynomials), we obtained accurate predictions. for the underlying sinusoidal function from which the data were generated.. In practice, of course, we have only a single data set, and so we have to find. a way to introduce variability between the different models within the committee.. One approach is to use bootstrap data sets, discussed in Section 1.2.3. Consider a. regression problem in which we are trying to predict the value of a single continuous. variable, and suppose we generate M bootstrap data sets and then use each to train. a separate copy ym(x) of a predictive model where m = 1, . . . , M. The committee. prediction is given by. yCOM(x) =. ym(x).. (14.7). This procedure is known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging (Breiman, 1996).. Suppose the true regression function that we are trying to predict is given by. h(x), so that the output of each of the models can be written as the true value plus. an error in the form. ym(x) = h(x) + 	m(x).. The average sum-of-squares error then takes the form. Ex. (14.9). where Ex[·] denotes a frequentist expectation with respect to the distribution of the. input vector x. The average error made by the models acting individually is therefore. {ym(x) − h(x)}2. m(x)2. = Ex. EAV =. m(x)2. Similarly, the expected error from the committee (14.7) is given by. ECOM = Ex. = Ex. 2. ym(x) − h(x). m(x). m=1. If we assume that the errors have zero mean and are uncorrelated, so that. Ex [	m(x)] = 0. Ex [	m(x)	l(x)] = 0,. m = l. (14.8). (14.10). (14.11). (14.12). (14.13). Exercise 14.2. then we obtain. "
237,14.3,Boosting,"657. ECOM =. 1. M. EAV.. (14.14). This apparently dramatic result suggests that the average error of a model can be. reduced by a factor of M simply by averaging M versions of the model. Unfortu-. nately, it depends on the key assumption that the errors due to the individual models. are uncorrelated. In practice, the errors are typically highly correlated, and the reduc-. tion in overall error is generally small. It can, however, be shown that the expected. committee error will not exceed the expected error of the constituent models, so that. ECOM � EAV. In order to achieve more significant improvements, we turn to a more. sophisticated technique for building committees, known as boosting.. Exercise 14.3. 14.3. Boosting. Boosting is a powerful technique for combining multiple ‘base’ classifiers to produce. a form of committee whose performance can be significantly better than that of any. of the base classifiers. Here we describe the most widely used form of boosting. algorithm called AdaBoost, short for ‘adaptive boosting’, developed by Freund and. Schapire (1996). Boosting can give good results even if the base classifiers have a. performance that is only slightly better than random, and hence sometimes the base. classifiers are known as weak learners. Originally designed for solving classification. problems, boosting can also be extended to regression (Friedman, 2001).. The principal difference between boosting and the committee methods such as. bagging discussed above, is that the base classifiers are trained in sequence, and. each base classifier is trained using a weighted form of the data set in which the. weighting coefficient associated with each data point depends on the performance. of the previous classifiers. In particular, points that are misclassified by one of the. base classifiers are given greater weight when used to train the next classifier in. the sequence. Once all the classifiers have been trained, their predictions are then. combined through a weighted majority voting scheme, as illustrated schematically. in Figure 14.1.. Consider a two-class classification problem, in which the training data comprises. input vectors x1, . . . , xN along with corresponding binary target variables t1, . . . , tN. where tn ∈ {−1, 1}. Each data point is given an associated weighting parameter. wn, which is initially set 1/N for all data points. We shall suppose that we have. a procedure available for training a base classifier using weighted data to give a. function y(x) ∈ {−1, 1}. At each stage of the algorithm, AdaBoost trains a new. classifier using a data set in which the weighting coefficients are adjusted according. to the performance of the previously trained classifier so as to give greater weight. to the misclassified data points. Finally, when the desired number of base classifiers. have been trained, they are combined to form a committee using coefficients that. give different weight to different base classifiers. The precise form of the AdaBoost. algorithm is given below.. {w(M ). n. yM (x). αmym(x). M. m. n=1. N. N. n=1. N. 658. 14. COMBINING MODELS.

We see that the first base classifier y1(x) is trained using weighting coeffi-. cients w(1). n that are all equal, which therefore corresponds to the usual procedure. for training a single classifier. From (14.18), we see that in subsequent iterations. the weighting coefficients w(m). are increased for data points that are misclassified. and decreased for data points that are correctly classified. Successive classifiers are. therefore forced to place greater emphasis on points that have been misclassified by. previous classifiers, and data points that continue to be misclassified by successive. classifiers receive ever greater weight. The quantities 	m represent weighted mea-. sures of the error rates of each of the base classifiers on the data set. We therefore. see that the weighting coefficients αm defined by (14.17) give greater weight to the. more accurate classifiers when computing the overall output given by (14.19).. The AdaBoost algorithm is illustrated in Figure 14.2, using a subset of 30 data. points taken from the toy classification data set shown in Figure A.7. Here each base. learners consists of a threshold on one of the input variables. This simple classifier. corresponds to a form of decision tree known as a ‘decision stumps’, i.e., a deci-. sion tree with a single node. Thus each base learner classifies an input according to. whether one of the input features exceeds some threshold and therefore simply parti-. tions the space into two regions separated by a linear decision surface that is parallel. to one of the axes.. "
238,14.3.1,Minimizing exponential error,"Boosting was originally motivated using statistical learning theory, leading to. upper bounds on the generalization error. However, these bounds turn out to be too. loose to have practical value, and the actual performance of boosting is much better. than the bounds alone would suggest. Friedman et al. (2000) gave a different and. very simple interpretation of boosting in terms of the sequential minimization of an. exponential error function.. Consider the exponential error function defined by. E =. n=1. exp{−tnfm(xn)}. (14.20). where fm(x) is a classifier defined in terms of a linear combination of base classifiers. yl(x) of the form. fm(x) =. 1. 2. αlyl(x). l=1. (14.21). and tn ∈ {−1, 1} are the training set target values. Our goal is to minimize E with. respect to both the weighting coefficients αl and the parameters of the base classifiers. yl(x)..

Each data point is depicted by a circle whose radius indicates the weight assigned to. that data point when training the most recently added base learner. Thus, for instance, we see that points that. are misclassified by the m = 1 base learner are given greater weight when training the m = 2 base learner.. Instead of doing a global error function minimization, however, we shall sup-. pose that the base classifiers y1(x), . . . , ym−1(x) are fixed, as are their coefficients. α1, . . . , αm−1, and so we are minimizing only with respect to αm and ym(x). Sep-. arating off the contribution from base classifier ym(x), we can then write the error. function in the form. E =. exp. −tnfm−1(xn) −. 1. 2 tnαmym(xn). w(m). n. exp. n=1. 1. 2 tnαmym(xn). (14.22). where the coefficients w(m). n = exp{−tnfm−1(xn)} can be viewed as constants. because we are optimizing only αm and ym(x).. If we denote by Tm the set of. data points that are correctly classified by ym(x), and if we denote the remaining. misclassified points by Mm, then we can in turn rewrite the error function in the. form. E = e−αm/2. n∈Tm. N. w(m). n. n=1. N. n. 14.3. Boosting. 661. w(m). n + eαm/2. n∈Mm. = (eαm/2 − e−αm/2). n I(ym(xn) = tn) + e−αm/2. w(m). w(m). n .. n=1. (14.23). When we minimize this with respect to ym(x), we see that the second term is con-. stant, and so this is equivalent to minimizing (14.15) because the overall multiplica-. tive factor in front of the summation does not affect the location of the minimum.. Similarly, minimizing with respect to αm, we obtain (14.17) in which 	m is defined. by (14.16).. From (14.22) we see that, having found αm and ym(x), the weights on the data. points are updated using. w(m+1). n. Making use of the fact that. = w(m). exp. 1. 2 tnαmym(xn). (14.24).

Because the term exp(−αm/2) is independent of n, we see that it weights all data. points by the same factor and so can be discarded. Thus we obtain (14.18).. Finally, once all the base classifiers are trained, new data points are classified by. evaluating the sign of the combined function defined according to (14.21). Because. the factor of 1/2 does not affect the sign it can be omitted, giving (14.19).. "
239,14.3.2,Error functions for boosting,"The exponential error function that is minimized by the AdaBoost algorithm. differs from those considered in previous chapters. To gain some insight into the. nature of the exponential error function, we first consider the expected error given. by. Ex,t [exp{−ty(x)}] =. t. exp{−ty(x)}p(t|x)p(x) dx.. (14.27). If we perform a variational minimization with respect to all possible functions y(x),. we obtain. y(x) =. ln. 1. 2. p(t = 1|x). p(t = −1|x). (14.28). Exercise 14.6. Exercise 14.7. 662. 14.

E(z). −2. −1. 0. 1. z. 2. which is half the log-odds. Thus the AdaBoost algorithm is seeking the best approx-. imation to the log odds ratio, within the space of functions represented by the linear. combination of base classifiers, subject to the constrained minimization resulting. from the sequential optimization strategy. This result motivates the use of the sign. function in (14.19) to arrive at the final classification decision.. We have already seen that the minimizer y(x) of the cross-entropy error (4.90). for two-class classification is given by the posterior class probability. In the case. of a target variable t ∈ {−1, 1}, we have seen that the error function is given by. ln(1 + exp(−yt)). This is compared with the exponential error function in Fig-. ure 14.3, where we have divided the cross-entropy error by a constant factor ln(2). so that it passes through the point (0, 1) for ease of comparison. We see that both. can be seen as continuous approximations to the ideal misclassification error func-. tion. An advantage of the exponential error is that its sequential minimization leads. to the simple AdaBoost scheme. One drawback, however, is that it penalizes large. negative values of ty(x) much more strongly than cross-entropy. In particular, we. see that for large negative values of ty, the cross-entropy grows linearly with |ty|,. whereas the exponential error function grows exponentially with |ty|. Thus the ex-. ponential error function will be much less robust to outliers or misclassified data. points. Another important difference between cross-entropy and the exponential er-. ror function is that the latter cannot be interpreted as the log likelihood function of. any well-defined probabilistic model. Furthermore, the exponential error does not. generalize to classification problems having K > 2 classes, again in contrast to the. cross-entropy for a probabilistic model, which is easily generalized to give (4.108).. The interpretation of boosting as the sequential optimization of an additive model. under an exponential error (Friedman et al., 2000) opens the door to a wide range. of boosting-like algorithms, including multiclass extensions, by altering the choice. of error function. It also motivates the extension to regression problems (Friedman,. 2001). If we consider a sum-of-squares error function for regression, then sequential. minimization of an additive model of the form (14.21) simply involves fitting each. new base classifier to the residual errors tn−fm−1(xn) from the previous model. As. we have noted, however, the sum-of-squares error is not robust to outliers, and this. Section 7.1.2. Exercise 14.8. Section 4.3.4. Exercise 14.9. Figure 14.4 Comparison of. the squared error.

These two error functions are compared in Figure 14.4.. −1. 0. 1. z. 14.4. Tree-based Models. There are various simple, but widely used, models that work by partitioning the. input space into cuboid regions, whose edges are aligned with the axes, and then. assigning a simple model (for example, a constant) to each region. They can be. viewed as a model combination method in which only one model is responsible. for making predictions at any given point in input space. The process of selecting. a specific model, given a new input x, can be described by a sequential decision. making process corresponding to the traversal of a binary tree (one that splits into. two branches at each node). Here we focus on a particular tree-based framework. called classification and regression trees, or CART (Breiman et al., 1984), although. there are many other variants going by such names as ID3 and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1986;. Quinlan, 1993).. Figure 14.5 shows an illustration of a recursive binary partitioning of the input. space, along with the corresponding tree structure. In this example, the first step.

E. divides the whole of the input space into two regions according to whether x1 � θ1. or x1 > θ1 where θ1 is a parameter of the model. This creates two subregions, each. of which can then be subdivided independently. For instance, the region x1 � θ1. is further subdivided according to whether x2 � θ2 or x2 > θ2, giving rise to the. regions denoted A and B. The recursive subdivision can be described by the traversal. of the binary tree shown in Figure 14.6. For any new input x, we determine which. region it falls into by starting at the top of the tree at the root node and following. a path down to a specific leaf node according to the decision criteria at each node.. Note that such decision trees are not probabilistic graphical models.. Within each region, there is a separate model to predict the target variable. For. instance, in regression we might simply predict a constant over each region, or in. classification we might assign each region to a specific class. A key property of tree-. based models, which makes them popular in fields such as medical diagnosis, for. example, is that they are readily interpretable by humans because they correspond. to a sequence of binary decisions applied to the individual input variables. For in-. stance, to predict a patient’s disease, we might first ask “is their temperature greater. than some threshold?”. If the answer is yes, then we might next ask “is their blood. pressure less than some threshold?”. Each leaf of the tree is then associated with a. specific diagnosis.. In order to learn such a model from a training set, we have to determine the. structure of the tree, including which input variable is chosen at each node to form. the split criterion as well as the value of the threshold parameter θi for the split. We. also have to determine the values of the predictive variable within each region.. Consider first a regression problem in which the goal is to predict a single target. variable t from a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T of input variables. The. training data consists of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along with the corresponding. continuous labels {t1, . . . , tN}. If the partitioning of the input space is given, and we. minimize the sum-of-squares error function, then the optimal value of the predictive. variable within any given region is just given by the average of the values of tn for. those data points that fall in that region.. Now consider how to determine the structure of the decision tree. Even for a. fixed number of nodes in the tree, the problem of determining the optimal structure. (including choice of input variable for each split as well as the corresponding thresh-. Exercise 14.10. 1. Nτ. |T|. τ =1. The pruning criterion is then given by. Qτ (T ) =. {tn − yτ}2 .. xn∈Rτ. C(T ) =. Qτ (T ) + λ|T|. The regularization parameter λ determines the trade-off between the overall residual. sum-of-squares error and the complexity of the model as measured by the number. |T| of leaf nodes, and its value is chosen by cross-validation.. For classification problems, the process of growing and pruning the tree is sim-. ilar, except that the sum-of-squares error is replaced by a more appropriate measure. 14.4. Tree-based Models. 665. olds) to minimize the sum-of-squares error is usually computationally infeasible due. to the combinatorially large number of possible solutions. Instead, a greedy opti-. mization is generally done by starting with a single root node, corresponding to the. whole input space, and then growing the tree by adding nodes one at a time. At each. step there will be some number of candidate regions in input space that can be split,. corresponding to the addition of a pair of leaf nodes to the existing tree. For each. of these, there is a choice of which of the D input variables to split, as well as the. value of the threshold. The joint optimization of the choice of region to split, and the. choice of input variable and threshold, can be done efficiently by exhaustive search. noting that, for a given choice of split variable and threshold, the optimal choice of. predictive variable is given by the local average of the data, as noted earlier. This. is repeated for all possible choices of variable to be split, and the one that gives the. smallest residual sum-of-squares error is retained.. Given a greedy strategy for growing the tree, there remains the issue of when. to stop adding nodes. A simple approach would be to stop when the reduction in. residual error falls below some threshold. However, it is found empirically that often. none of the available splits produces a significant reduction in error, and yet after. several more splits a substantial error reduction is found. For this reason, it is com-. mon practice to grow a large tree, using a stopping criterion based on the number. of data points associated with the leaf nodes, and then prune back the resulting tree.. The pruning is based on a criterion that balances residual error against a measure of. model complexity. If we denote the starting tree for pruning by T0, then we define. T ⊂ T0 to be a subtree of T0 if it can be obtained by pruning nodes from T0 (in. other words, by collapsing internal nodes by combining the corresponding regions).. Suppose the leaf nodes are indexed by τ = 1, . . . ,|T|, with leaf node τ representing. a region Rτ of input space having Nτ data points, and |T| denoting the total number. of leaf nodes. The optimal prediction for region Rτ is then given by. yτ =. tn. xn∈Rτ. and the corresponding contribution to the residual sum-of-squares is then. (14.29). (14.30). (14.31). k=1. K. K.

They. encourage the formation of regions in which a high proportion of the data points are. assigned to one class. The cross entropy and the Gini index are better measures than. the misclassification rate for growing the tree because they are more sensitive to the. node probabilities. Also, unlike misclassification rate, they are differentiable and. hence better suited to gradient based optimization methods. For subsequent pruning. of the tree, the misclassification rate is generally used.. The human interpretability of a tree model such as CART is often seen as its. major strength. However, in practice it is found that the particular tree structure that. is learned is very sensitive to the details of the data set, so that a small change to the. training data can result in a very different set of splits (Hastie et al., 2001).. There are other problems with tree-based methods of the kind considered in. this section. One is that the splits are aligned with the axes of the feature space,. which may be very suboptimal. For instance, to separate two classes whose optimal. decision boundary runs at 45 degrees to the axes would need a large number of. axis-parallel splits of the input space as compared to a single non-axis-aligned split.. Furthermore, the splits in a decision tree are hard, so that each region of input space. is associated with one, and only one, leaf node model. The last issue is particularly. problematic in regression where we are typically aiming to model smooth functions,. and yet the tree model produces piecewise-constant predictions with discontinuities. at the split boundaries.. "
241,14.5,Conditional Mixture Models,"We have seen that standard decision trees are restricted by hard, axis-aligned splits of. the input space. These constraints can be relaxed, at the expense of interpretability,. by allowing soft, probabilistic splits that can be functions of all of the input variables,. not just one of them at a time. If we also give the leaf models a probabilistic inter-. pretation, we arrive at a fully probabilistic tree-based model called the hierarchical. mixture of experts, which we consider in Section 14.5.3.. An alternative way to motivate the hierarchical mixture of experts model is to. start with a standard probabilistic mixtures of unconditional density models such as. Gaussians and replace the component densities with conditional distributions. Here. "

Finally, if we allow each component in the mixture model to be. itself a mixture of experts model, then we obtain a hierarchical mixture of experts.. 14.5.1 Mixtures of linear regression models. One of the many advantages of giving a probabilistic interpretation to the lin-. ear regression model is that it can then be used as a component in more complex. probabilistic models. This can be done, for instance, by viewing the conditional. distribution representing the linear regression model as a node in a directed prob-. abilistic graph. Here we consider a simple example corresponding to a mixture of. linear regression models, which represents a straightforward extension of the Gaus-. sian mixture model discussed in Section 9.2 to the case of conditional Gaussian. distributions.. We therefore consider K linear regression models, each governed by its own. weight parameter wk. In many applications, it will be appropriate to use a common. noise variance, governed by a precision parameter β, for all K components, and this. is the case we consider here. We will once again restrict attention to a single target. variable t, though the extension to multiple outputs is straightforward. If we denote. the mixing coefficients by πk, then the mixture distribution can be written. p(t|θ) =. πkN (t|wT. k φ, β−1). (14.34). where θ denotes the set of all adaptive parameters in the model, namely W = {wk},. π = {πk}, and β. The log likelihood function for this model, given a data set of. observations {φn, tn}, then takes the form. ln p(t|θ) =. ln. πkN (tn|wT. k φn, β−1). (14.35). where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T denotes the vector of target variables.. In order to maximize this likelihood function, we can once again appeal to the. EM algorithm, which will turn out to be a simple extension of the EM algorithm for. unconditional Gaussian mixtures of Section 9.2. We can therefore build on our expe-. rience with the unconditional mixture and introduce a set Z = {zn} of binary latent. variables where znk ∈ {0, 1} in which, for each data point n, all of the elements. k = 1, . . . , K are zero except for a single value of 1 indicating which component. of the mixture was responsible for generating that data point. The joint distribution. over latent and observed variables can be represented by the graphical model shown. in Figure 14.7.. The complete-data log likelihood function then takes the form. ln p(t, Z|θ) =. n=1. k=1. znk ln. πkN (tn|wT. k φn, β−1). (14.36). Exercise 14.12. Exercise 14.13. zn. tn. φn. N. n=1. k=1. K. N. n=1.

The EM algorithm begins by first choosing an initial value θold for the model param-. eters. In the E step, these parameter values are then used to evaluate the posterior. probabilities, or responsibilities, of each component k for every data point n given. by. γnk = E[znk] = p(k|φn, θold) = πkN (tn|wT. j πjN (tn|wT. k φn, β−1). j φn, β−1) .. (14.37). The responsibilities are then used to determine the expectation, with respect to the. posterior distribution p(Z|t, θold), of the complete-data log likelihood, which takes. the form. Q(θ, θold) = EZ [ln p(t, Z|θ)] =. γnk. ln πk + lnN (tn|wT. k φn, β−1). In the M step, we maximize the function Q(θ, θold) with respect to θ, keeping the. γnk fixed. For the optimization with respect to the mixing coefficients πk we need. k πk = 1, which can be done with the aid of a. to take account of the constraint. Lagrange multiplier, leading to an M-step re-estimation equation for πk in the form. Exercise 14.14. 1. N. γnk.. (14.38). Note that this has exactly the same form as the corresponding result for a simple. mixture of unconditional Gaussians given by (9.22).. Next consider the maximization with respect to the parameter vector wk of the. kth linear regression model. Substituting for the Gaussian distribution, we see that. the function Q(θ, θold), as a function of the parameter vector wk, takes the form. Q(θ, θold) =. γnk. n=1. 2. tn − wT. k φn. 2. + const. (14.39). where the constant term includes the contributions from other weight vectors wj for. j = k. Note that the quantity we are maximizing is similar to the (negative of the). standard sum-of-squares error (3.12) for a single linear regression model, but with. the inclusion of the responsibilities γnk. This represents a weighted least squares. γnk. γnk. 1. 2. n=1. N. N. K. n=1. k=1. N. K. 14.5. Conditional Mixture Models. 669. problem, in which the term corresponding to the nth data point carries a weighting. coefficient given by βγnk, which could be interpreted as an effective precision for. each data point. We see that each component linear regression model in the mixture,. governed by its own parameter vector wk, is fitted separately to the whole data set in. the M step, but with each data point n weighted by the responsibility γnk that model. k takes for that data point. Setting the derivative of (14.39) with respect to wk equal. to zero gives. 0 =. tn − wT. k φn. φn. (14.40). which we can write in matrix notation as. 0 = ΦTRk(t − Φwk). (14.41). where Rk = diag(γnk) is a diagonal matrix of size N × N. Solving for wk, we. obtain. (14.42). This represents a set of modified normal equations corresponding to the weighted. least squares problem, of the same form as (4.99) found in the context of logistic. regression. Note that after each E step, the matrix Rk will change and so we will. have to solve the normal equations afresh in the subsequent M step.. −1 ΦTRkt.. ΦTRkΦ. wk =. Finally, we maximize Q(θ, θold) with respect to β. Keeping only terms that. depend on β, the function Q(θ, θold) can be written. Q(θ, θold) =. n=1. k=1. ln β −. 2. tn − wT. k φn. 2. (14.43). Setting the derivative with respect to β equal to zero, and rearranging, we obtain the. M-step equation for β in the form. 1. 1. N. γnk. tn − wT. k φn. 2. (14.44). In Figure 14.8, we illustrate this EM algorithm using the simple example of. fitting a mixture of two straight lines to a data set having one input variable x and. one target variable t. The predictive density (14.34) is plotted in Figure 14.9 using. the converged parameter values obtained from the EM algorithm, corresponding to. the right-hand plot in Figure 14.8. Also shown in this figure is the result of fitting. a single linear regression model, which gives a unimodal predictive density. We see. that the mixture model gives a much better representation of the data distribution,. and this is reflected in the higher likelihood value. However, the mixture model. also assigns significant probability mass to regions where there is no data because its. predictive distribution is bimodal for all values of x. This problem can be resolved by. extending the model to allow the mixture coefficients themselves to be functions of. x, leading to models such as the mixture density networks discussed in Section 5.6,. and hierarchical mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3.. 670. 14.

243,14.5.2,Mixtures of logistic models,"Because the logistic regression model defines a conditional distribution for the. target variable, given the input vector, it is straightforward to use it as the component. distribution in a mixture model, thereby giving rise to a richer family of conditional. distributions compared to a single logistic regression model. This example involves. a straightforward combination of ideas encountered in earlier sections of the book. and will help consolidate these for the reader.. The conditional distribution of the target variable, for a probabilistic mixture of. K logistic regression models, is given by. p(t|φ, θ) =. πkyt. k [1 − yk]1−t. (14.45). where φ is the feature vector, yk = σ. denotes the adjustable parameters namely {πk} and {wk}.. wT. k φ. Now suppose we are given a data set {φn, tn}.

A vertical slice through one of these plots at a particular. value of x represents the corresponding conditional distribution p(t|x), which we see is bimodal. The plot on the. right shows the predictive density for a single linear regression model fitted to the same data set using maximum. likelihood. This model has a smaller log likelihood of −27.6.. function is then given by. πkytn. p(t|θ) =. where ynk = σ(wT. k φn) and t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. We can maximize this likelihood. function iteratively by making use of the EM algorithm. This involves introducing. latent variables znk that correspond to a 1-of-K coded binary indicator variable for. each data point n. The complete-data likelihood function is then given by. nk [1 − ynk]1−tn. (14.46). n=1. p(t, Z|θ) =. πkytn. nk [1 − ynk]1−tn. znk. (14.47). where Z is the matrix of latent variables with elements znk. We initialize the EM. algorithm by choosing an initial value θold for the model parameters.

The M step involves maximization of this function with respect to θ, keeping θold,. and hence γnk, fixed. Maximization with respect to πk can be done in the usual way,. k πk = 1, giving. with a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the summation constraint. the familiar result. πk =. γnk.. (14.50). To determine the {wk}, we note that the Q(θ, θold) function comprises a sum. over terms indexed by k each of which depends only on one of the vectors wk, so. that the different vectors are decoupled in the M step of the EM algorithm. In other. words, the different components interact only via the responsibilities, which are fixed. during the M step. Note that the M step does not have a closed-form solution and. must be solved iteratively using, for instance, the iterative reweighted least squares. (IRLS) algorithm. The gradient and the Hessian for the vector wk are given by. ∇kQ =. n=1. γnk(tn − ynk)φn. Hk = −∇k∇kQ =. γnkynk(1 − ynk)φnφT. n. (14.51). (14.52). where ∇k denotes the gradient with respect to wk. For fixed γnk, these are indepen-. dent of {wj} for j = k and so we can solve for each wk separately using the IRLS. algorithm. Thus the M-step equations for component k correspond simply to fitting. a single logistic regression model to a weighted data set in which data point n carries. a weight γnk. Figure 14.10 shows an example of the mixture of logistic regression. models applied to a simple classification problem. The extension of this model to a. mixture of softmax models for more than two classes is straightforward.. "
244,14.5.3,Mixtures of experts,"In Section 14.5.1, we considered a mixture of linear regression models, and in. Section 14.5.2 we discussed the analogous mixture of linear classifiers. Although. these simple mixtures extend the flexibility of linear models to include more com-. plex (e.g., multimodal) predictive distributions, they are still very limited. We can. further increase the capability of such models by allowing the mixing coefficients. themselves to be functions of the input variable, so that. p(t|x) =. k=1. πk(x)pk(t|x).. (14.53). This is known as a mixture of experts model (Jacobs et al., 1991) in which the mix-. ing coefficients πk(x) are known as gating functions and the individual component. densities pk(t|x) are called experts. The notion behind the terminology is that differ-. ent components can model the distribution in different regions of input space (they. are ‘experts’ at making predictions in their own regions), and the gating functions. determine which components are dominant in which region.. The gating functions πk(x) must satisfy the usual constraints for mixing co-. efficients, namely 0 � πk(x) � 1 and. k πk(x) = 1. They can therefore be. represented, for example, by linear softmax models of the form (4.104) and (4.105).. If the experts are also linear (regression or classification) models, then the whole. model can be fitted efficiently using the EM algorithm, with iterative reweighted. least squares being employed in the M step (Jordan and Jacobs, 1994).. Exercise 14.17. Section 4.3.3. Such a model still has significant limitations due to the use of linear models. for the gating and expert functions. A much more flexible model is obtained by. using a multilevel gating function to give the hierarchical mixture of experts, or. HME model (Jordan and Jacobs, 1994). To understand the structure of this model,. imagine a mixture distribution in which each component in the mixture is itself a. mixture distribution. For simple unconditional mixtures, this hierarchical mixture is. trivially equivalent to a single flat mixture distribution. However, when the mixing. coefficients are input dependent, this hierarchical model becomes nontrivial. The. HME model can also be viewed as a probabilistic version of decision trees discussed. in Section 14.4 and can again be trained efficiently by maximum likelihood using an. EM algorithm with IRLS in the M step. A Bayesian treatment of the HME has been. given by Bishop and Svens´en (2003) based on variational inference.. We shall not discuss the HME in detail here. However, it is worth pointing out. the close connection with the mixture density network discussed in Section 5.6. The. principal advantage of the mixtures of experts model is that it can be optimized by. EM in which the M step for each mixture component and gating model involves. a convex optimization (although the overall optimization is nonconvex). By con-. trast, the advantage of the mixture density network approach is that the component. 14.5. Conditional Mixture Models. 673. Figure 14.10 Illustration of a mixture of logistic regression models. The left plot shows data points drawn. from two classes denoted red and blue, in which the background colour (which varies from pure red to pure blue). denotes the true probability of the class label. The centre plot shows the result of fitting a single logistic regression. model using maximum likelihood, in which the background colour denotes the corresponding probability of the. class label. Because the colour is a near-uniform purple, we see that the model assigns a probability of around. 0.5 to each of the classes over most of input space. The right plot shows the result of fitting a mixture of two. logistic regression models, which now gives much higher probability to the correct labels for many of the points. in the blue class.. 674. 14.
