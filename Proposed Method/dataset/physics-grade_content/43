4.1 Weight

Weight is the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on any object. The weight of an objects

gives you an indication of how strongly the Earth attracts that body towards its centre. Weight

is calculated as follows:

Weight = mg

where m = mass of the object (in kg)

and g = the acceleration due to gravity (9,8 m·s−2)

For example, what is Sarah's weight if her mass is 50 kg. Sarah's

weight is calculated according to:

Weight = mg

= (50 kg)(9,8m · s−2)

= 490 kg · m · s−2

= 490 N

Important: Weight is sometimes abbreviated as Fg which refers to the force of gravity. Do

not use the abbreviation 'W' for weight as it refers to 'Work'.

Now, we have said that the value of g is approximately 9,8 m·s−2on the surface of the Earth.

The actual value varies slightly over the surface of the Earth. Each planet in our Solar System

has its own value for g. These values are listed as multiples of g on Earth in Table 4.1

Worked Example 15: Determining mass and weight on other planets

Question: Sarah's mass on Earth is 50 kg. What is her mass and weight on Mars?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what information is given and what is asked

m (on Earth) = 50 kg

m (on Mars) = ?

Weight (on Mars) = ?

mean the cloud tops of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).

Step 2 : Calculate her mass on Mars

Sarah's mass does not change because she is still made up of the same amount of

matter. Her mass on Mars is therefore 50 kg.

Step 3 : Calculate her weight on Mars

Sarah′s weight = 50× 0,38× 9,8

= 186,2 N
