22.2.2 Deviation from Hooke's Law

We know that if you have a small spring and you pull it apart too much it stops 'working'. It

bends out of shape and loses its springiness. When this happens Hooke's Law no longer

applies, the spring's behaviour deviates from Hooke's Law.

Depending on what type of material we are dealing the manner in which it deviates from

Hooke's Law is different. We give classify materials by this deviation. The following graphs

show the relationship between force and extension for different materials and they all deviate

from Hooke's Law. Remember that a straight line show proportionality so as soon as the graph

is no longer a straight line, Hooke's Law no longer applies.

Brittle material

extension

Figure 22.2: A hard, brittle substance

This graph shows the relationship between force and extension for a brittle, but strong material.

Note that there is very little extension for a large force but then the material suddenly

fractures. Brittleness is the property of a material that makes it break easily without bending.

Have you ever dropped something made of glass and seen it shatter? Glass does this because

of its brittleness.

Plastic material

extension

Figure 22.3: A plastic material's response to an applied force.

Here the graph shows the relationship between force and extension for a plastic material. The

material extends under a small force but it does not fracture.

Ductile material

extension

Figure 22.4: A ductile substance.

In this graph the relationship between force and extension is for a material that is ductile. The

material shows plastic behaviour over a range of forces before the material finally fractures.

Ductility is the ability of a material to be stretched into a new shape without breaking.

Ductility is one of the characteristic properties of metals.

A good example of this is aluminium, many things are made of aluminium. Aluminium is used

for making everything from cooldrink cans to aeroplane parts and even engine blocks for cars.

Think about squashing and bending a cooldrink can.

Brittleness is the opposite of ductility.

When a material reaches a point where Hooke's Law is no longer valid, we say it has reached

its limit of proportionality. After this point, the material will not return to its original shape

after the force has been removed. We say it has reached its elastic limit.

Definition: Elastic limit

The elastic limit is the point beyond which permanent deformation takes place.

Definition: Limit of proportionality

The limit of proportionality is the point beyond which Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed.

7. A spring has a spring constant of −200 N.m−1. By how much will it stretch if

a load of 25 N is applied to it?

to it.
