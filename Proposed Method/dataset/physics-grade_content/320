19.3 Resistance

In Grade 10, you learnt about resistors and were introduced to circuits where resistors were

connected in series and circuits where resistors were connected in parallel. In a series circuit

there is one path for the current to flow through. In a parallel circuit there are multiple paths

for the current to flow through.
