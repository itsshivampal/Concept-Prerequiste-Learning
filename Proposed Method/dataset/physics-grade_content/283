17.2 Forces between charges - Coulomb's Law

Like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. If the charges are at

rest then the force between them is known as the electrostatic force. The electrostatic force

between charges increases when the magnitude of the charges increases or the distance

between the charges decreases.

The electrostatic force was first studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through

his observations he was able to show that the electrostatic force between two point-like charges

is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. He also discovered

that the force is proportional to the product of the charges on the two objects.

F ∝ Q1Q2 ,

r2

where Q1 is the charge on the one point-like object, Q2 is the charge on the second, and r is

the distance between the two. The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point-like

charges is given by Coulomb's Law.

Definition: Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's Law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point

charges is directly proportional to the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional

to the square of the distance between the charges.

Q1Q2

F = k

r2

and the proportionality constant k is called the electrostatic constant and has the value:

k = 8,99× 109N ·m2 ·C−2.

Extension: Similarity of Coulomb's Law to the Newton's Universal Law of

Gravitation.

Notice how similar Coulomb's Law is to the form of Newton's Universal Law of

Gravitation between two point-like particles:

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two particles, r is the distance between

them, and G is the gravitational constant.

Both laws represent the force exerted by particles (masses or charges) on each

other that interact by means of a field.

It is very interesting that Coulomb's Law has been shown to be correct no

matter how small the distance, nor how large the charge. For example it still

applies inside the atom (over distances smaller than 10−10m).

Worked Example 110: Coulomb's Law I

Question: Two point-like charges carrying charges of +3× 10−9C and

−5× 10−9C are 2m apart. Determine the magnitude of the force between them

and state whether it is attractive or repulsive.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to find the force between two point charges given the charges and

the distance between them.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We can draw a diagram of the situation.

Thus the magnitude of the force is 3,37× 10−8N. However since both point

charges have opposite signs, the force will be attractive.

Next is another example that demonstrates the difference in magnitude between the

gravitational force and the electrostatic force.

Important: We can apply Newton's Third Law to charges because, two charges exert forces
of equal magnitude on one another in opposite directions.
Important: Coulomb's Law
When substituting into the Coulomb's Law equation, it is not necessary to include the signs of
the charges. Instead, select a positive direction. Then forces that tend to move the charge in
this direction are added, while forces that act in the opposite direction are subtracted.
Worked Example 112: Coulomb's Law III
Question: Three point charges are in a straight line. Their charges are Q1 =
+2× 10−9C, Q2 = +1× 10−9C and Q3 = −3× 10−9C. The distance between
Q1 and Q2 is 2× 10−2m and the distance between Q2 and Q3 is 4× 10−2m.

Answer
Step 1 : Determine what is required
We are needed to calculate the net force on Q2. This force is the sum of the two
electrostatic forces - the forces between Q1 on Q2 and Q3 on Q2.
Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem
• We need to calculate the two electrostatic forces on Q2, using Coulomb's Law
equation.
• We then need to add up the two forces using our rules for adding vector
quantities, because force is a vector quantity.
Step 3 : Determine what is given
We are given all the charges and all the distances.
Step 4 : Calculate the forces.

We mentioned in Chapter 9 that charge placed on a spherical conductor spreads evenly along
the surface. As a result, if we are far enough from the charged sphere, electrostatically, it
behaves as a point-like charge. Thus we can treat spherical conductors (e.g. metallic balls) as
point-like charges, with all the charge acting at the centre.
