7.6.2 Fibre Optics

Total internal reflection is a powerful tool since it can be used to confine light. One of the

most common applications of total internal reflection is in fibre optics. An optical fibre is a thin,

transparent fibre, usually made of glass or plastic, for transmitting light. Optical fibres are usually

thinner than a human hair! The construction of a single optical fibre is shown in Figure 7.23.

The basic functional structure of an optical fibre consists of an outer protective cladding and an

inner core through which light pulses travel. The overall diameter of the fibre is about 125 µm

(125×10−6m) and that of the core is just about 10 µm (10×10−6m). The mode of operation

of the optical fibres, as mentioned above, depends on the phenomenon of total internal reflection.

The difference in refractive index of the cladding and the core allows total internal reflection in

the same way as happens at an air-water surface. If light is incident on a cable end with an

angle of incidence greater than the critical angle then the light will remain trapped inside the

glass strand. In this way, light travels very quickly down the length of the cable.

Fibre Optics in Telecommunications

Optical fibres are most common in telecommunications, because information can be transported

over long distances, with minimal loss of data. The minimised loss of data gives optical fibres

an advantage over conventional cables.

Data is transmitted from one end of the fibre to another in the form of laser pulses. A single strand

is capable of handling over 3000 simultaneous transmissions which is a huge improvement over

the conventional co-axial cables. Multiple signal transmission is achieved by sending individual

light pulses at slightly different angles. For example if one of the pulses makes a 72,23◦ angle

of incidence then a separate pulse can be sent at an angle of 72,26◦! The transmitted data is

received almost instantaneously at the other end of the cable since the information coded onto

the laser travels at the speed of light! During transmission over long distances repeater stations

are used to amplify the signal which has weakened somewhat by the time it reaches the station.

The amplified signals are then relayed towards their destination and may encounter several other

repeater stations on the way.

Fibre Optics in Medicine

Optic fibres are used in medicine in endoscopes.

Itneterreessttinigng Endoscopy means to look inside and refers to looking inside the human body for

FFacctt diagnosing medical conditions.

The main part of an endoscope is the optical fibre. Light is shone down the optical fibre and a

medical doctor can use the endoscope to look inside a patient. Endoscopes are used to examine

the inside of a patient's stomach, by inserting the endoscope down the patient's throat.

Endoscopes allow minimally invasive surgery. This means that a person can be diagnosed and

treated through a small incision. This has advantages over open surgery because endoscopy is

quicker and cheaper and the patient recovers more quickly. The alternative is open surgery which

is expensive, requires more time and is more traumatic for the patient.

Exercise: Total Internal Reflection and Fibre Optics

1. Describe total internal reflection, referring to the conditions that must be sat-

isfied for total internal reflection to occur.

2. Define what is meant by the critical angle when referring to total internal

reflection. Include a ray diagram to explain the concept.

3. Will light travelling from diamond to silicon ever undergo total internal reflec-

tion?

4. Will light travelling from sapphire to diamond undergo total internal reflection?

5. What is the critical angle for light traveling from air to acetone?

6. Light traveling from diamond to water strikes the interface with an angle of

incidence of 86◦. Calculate the critical angle to determine whether the light be

totally internally reflected and so be trapped within the water.

7. Which of the following interfaces will have the largest critical angle?

(a) a glass to water interface

(b) a diamond to water interface

(c) a diamond to glass interface

8. If the fibre optic strand is made from glass, determine the critical angle of the

light ray so that the ray stays within the fibre optic strand.

9. A glass slab is inserted in a tank of water. If the refractive index of water is

1,33 and that of glass is 1,5, find the critical angle.

10. A diamond ring is placed in a container full of glycerin. If the critical angle is

found to be 37,4◦ and the refractive index of glycerin is given to be 1,47, find

the refractive index of diamond.

11. An optical fibre is made up of a core of refractive index 1,9, while the refractive

index of the cladding is 1,5. Calculate the maximum angle which a light pulse

can make with the wall of the core. NOTE: The question does not ask for the

angle of incidence but for the angle made by the ray with the wall of the core,

which will be equal to 90◦- angle of incidence.
