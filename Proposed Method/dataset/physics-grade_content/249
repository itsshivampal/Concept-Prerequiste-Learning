14.3 Characteristics of Longitudinal Waves

As for transverse waves the following can be defined for longitudinal waves: wavelength,

amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed. However instead of peaks and troughs,

longitudinal waves have compressions and rarefactions.

Definition: Compression

A compression is a region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are closer together.

Definition: Rarefaction

A rarefaction is a region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are further apart.
