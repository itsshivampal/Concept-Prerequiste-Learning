15.4.1 Intensity of Sound

Intensity is one indicator of amplitude. Intensity is the energy transmitted over a unit of area

each second.

Extension: Intensity

Intensity is defined as:

energy power

Intensity = =

time× area area

By the definition of intensity, we can see that the units of intensity are

Joules Watts

=

s ·m2 m2

The unit of intensity is the decibel (symbol: dB). This reduces to an SI equivalent of W ·m−2.

The threshold of hearing is 10−12 W ·m−2. Below this intensity, the sound is too soft for the

ear to hear. The threshold of pain is 1.0 W ·m−2. Above this intensity a sound is so loud it

becomes uncomfortable for the ear.

Notice that there is a factor of 1012 between the thresholds of hearing and pain. This is one

reason we define the decibel (dB) scale.

Extension: dB Scale

The intensity in dB of a sound of intensity I, is given by:

I

β = 10 log Io = 10

−12 W ·m−2 (15.1)

Io

In this way we can compress the whole hearing intensity scale into a range from 0 dB to 120 dB.

Notice that there are sounds which exceed the threshold of pain. Exposure to these sounds can

cause immediate damage to hearing. In fact, exposure to sounds from 80 dB and above can

damage hearing over time. Measures can be taken to avoid damage, such as wearing earplugs

or ear muffs. Limiting exposure time and increasing distance between you and the source are

also important steps to protecting your hearing.

Activity :: Discussion : Importance of Safety Equipment

Working in groups of 5, discuss the importance of safety equipment such as ear

protectors for workers in loud environments, e.g. those who use jack hammers or

direct aeroplanes to their parking bays. Write up your conclusions in a one page

report. Some prior research into the importance of safety equipment might be

necessary to complete this group discussion.

elliptical window. The elliptical window is the beginning of the inner ear. From the elliptical

window the sound waves are transmitted through the liquid in the inner ear and interpreted as

sounds by the brain. The inner ear, made of the semicircular canals, the cochlea, and the

auditory nerve, is filled with fluid. The fluid allows the body to detect quick movements and

maintain balance. The snail-shaped cochlea is covered in nerve cells. There are more than 25

000 hairlike nerve cells. Different nerve cells vibrate with different frequencies. When a nerve

cell vibrates, it releases electrical impulses to the auditory nerve. The impulses are sent to the

brain through the auditory nerve and understood as sound.
