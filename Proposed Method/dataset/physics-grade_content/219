12.5.8 Conservation of Momentum

In the absence of an external force acting on a system, momentum is conserved.

Definition: Conservation of Linear Momentum

The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant. An isolated system has no

forces acting on it from the outside.

This means that in an isolated system the total momentum before a collision or explosion is

equal to the total momentum after the collision or explosion.

Consider a simple collision of two billiard balls. The balls are rolling on a frictionless surface and

the system is isolated. So, we can apply conservation of momentum. The first ball has a mass

m1 and an initial velocity vi1. The second ball has a mass m2 and moves towards the first ball

with an initial velocity vi2. This situation is shown in Figure 12.14.

vi1 vi2

m1 m2

Figure 12.14: Before the collision.

The total momentum of the system before the collision, pi is:

pi = m1vi1 +m2vi2

After the two balls collide and move away they each have a different momentum. If the first

ball has a final velocity of vf1 and the second ball has a final velocity of vf2 then we have the

situation shown in Figure 12.15.

m1 m2

The total momentum of the system after the collision, pf is:

pf = m1vf1 +m2vf2

12.5 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11

This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. There-

fore, by the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the

collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the

conservation of momentum in a collision of two objects,

pi = pf

m1vi1 +m2vi2 = m1vf1 +m2vf2

m1 : mass of object 1 (kg)

m2 : mass of object 2 (kg)

vi1 : initial velocity of object 1 (m·s−1+ direction)

vi2 : initial velocity of object 2 (m·s−1+ direction)

vf1 : final velocity of object 1 (m·s−1+ direction)

vf2 : final velocity of object 2 (m·s−1+ direction)

This equation is always true - momentum is always conserved in collisions.

Worked Example 92: Conservation of Momentum 1

Question: A toy car of mass 1 kg moves westwards with a speed of 2 m·s−1. It

collides head-on with a toy train. The train has a mass of 1,5 kg and is moving

at a speed of 1,5 m·s−1eastwards. If the car rebounds at 2,05 m·s−1, calculate the

velocity of the train.

Answer

Step 1 : Draw rough sketch of the situation

BEFORE vi1 = 1,5 m·s−1 vi2 = 2 m·s−1

1,5 kg 1 kg

AFTER vf1 = ? m·s−1 vf2 = 2,05 m·s−1

Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference

We will choose to the east as positive.

Step 3 : Apply the Law of Conservation of momentum

pi = pf

m1vi1 +m2vi2 = m1vf1 +m2vf2

(1,5)(+1,5) + (2)(−2) = (1,5)(vf1) + (2)(2,05)

2,25− 4− 4,1 = 1,5 vf1

5,85 = 1,5 vf1

vf1 = 3,9m · s−1eastwards

Worked Example 93: Conservation of Momentum 2
Question: A helicopter flies at a speed of 275 m·s−1. The pilot fires a missile
forward out of a gun barrel at a speed of 700 m·s−1. The respective masses of the
helicopter and the missile are 5000 kg and 50 kg. Calculate the new speed of the
helicopter immmediately after the missile had been fired.
Answer
Step 1 : Draw rough sketch of the situation
helicopter
AFTER BEFORE
vf1 = ? m·s−1 vi1 = 275 m·s−1
vf2 = 700 m·s−1 5000 kg vi2 = 275 m·s−1
missile
50 kg
Figure 12.16: helicopter and missile
Step 2 : Analyse the question and list what is given
m1 = 5000 kg
m2 = 50 kg
vi1 = vi2 = 275 m·s−1
vf1 = ?
vf2 = 700 m·s−1
Step 3 : Apply the Law of Conservation of momentum
The helicopter and missile are connected initially and move at the same velocity. We
will therefore combine their masses and change the momentum equation as follows:
pi = pf
(m1 +m2)vi = m1vf1 +m2vf2
(5000 + 50)(275) = (5000)(vf1) + (50)(700)
1388750− 35000 = (5000)(vf1)
vf1 = 270,75m · s−1
Note that speed is asked and not velocity, therefore no direction is included in the
answer.
