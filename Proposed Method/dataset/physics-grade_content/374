22.4.4 Steps of Roman Swordsmithing

• Purifying the iron ore.

• Heating the iron blocks in a furnace with charcoal.

• Hammering and getting into the needed shape. The smith used a hammer to pound the

metal into blade shape. He usually used tongs to hold the iron block in place.

• Reheating. When the blade cooled, the smith reheated it to keep it workable. While

reheated and hammered repeatedly.

• Quenching which involved the process of white heating and cooling in water. Quenching

made the blade harder and stronger. At the same time it made the blade quite brittle,

which was a considerable problem for the sword smiths.

• Tempering was then done to avoid brittleness the blade was tempered. In another words

it was reheated a final time to a very specific temperature. How the Romans do balanced

the temperature? The smith was guided only by the blade's color and his own experience.

22.4 CHAPTER 22. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER - GRADE 12

Cold working

Cold working is a process in which a metal is strengthened by repeatedly being reshaped. This

is carried out at a temperature below the melting point of the metal. The repeated shaping of

the metal result in dislocations which then prevent further dislocations in the metal. Cold

working increases the strength of the metal but in so doing, the metal loses its ductility. We

say the metal is work-hardened.

Annealing

Annealing is a process in which a metal is heated strongly to a temperature that is about half

of its melting point. When the metal cools, it recrystallises which removes vacancies and

dislocations in the metal. Annealing is often used before cold working. In annealing the metal

cools very very slowly.

Alloying

An alloy is a mixture of a metal with other substances. The other substances can be metal or

non-metal. An alloy often has properties that are very different to the properties of the

substances from which it is made. The added substances strengthen the metal by preventing

dislocations from spreading. Ordinary steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. There are many

types of steel that also include other metals with iron and carbon. Brass is an alloy of copper

and Zinc. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Gold and silver that is used in coins or jewellery

are also alloyed.

Tempering

Tempering is a process in which a metal is melted then quickly cooled. The rapid cooling is

called quenching. Usually tempering is done a number of times before a metal has the correct

properties that are needed for a particular application.

Sintering

Sintering is used for making ceramic objects among other things. In this process the substance

is heated so that its particles stick together. It is used with substances that have a very high

melting point. The resulting product is often very pure and it is formed in the process into the

shape that is wanted. Unfortunately, sintered products are brittle.
