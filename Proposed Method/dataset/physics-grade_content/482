31.3.1 Applications of the photoelectric effect

We have learnt that a metal contains electrons that are free to move between the valence and

conduction bands. When a photon strikes the surface of a metal, it gives all its energy to one

electron in the metal.

• If the photon energy is equal to the energy between two energy levels then the electron is

excited to the higher energy level.

• If the photon energy is greater than or equal to the work function (energy needed to

escape from the metal), then the electron is emitted from the surface of the metal (the

photoelectric effect).

The work function is different for different elements. The smaller the work function, the easier

it is for electrons to be emitted from the metal. Metals with low work functions make good

conductors. This is because the electrons are attached less strongly to their surroundings and

can move more easily through these materials. This reduces the resistance of the material to

the flow of current i.e. it conducts well. Table 31.1 shows the work functions for a range of

elements.

Itneterreessttinigng The electron volt is the kinetic energy gained by an electron passing through

FFacctt a potential difference of one volt (1 V). A volt is not a measure of energy, but

the electron volt is a unit of energy. When you connect a 1.5 Volt battery to

a circuit, you can give 1.5 eV of energy to every electron.

Worked Example 189: The photoelectric effect - I

Question: Ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of 250 nm is incident on a silver

foil (work function φ = 6,9× 10−19). What is the maximum kinetic energy of the

emitted electrons?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required and how to approach the problem

We need to determine the maximum kinetic energy of an electron ejected from a

silver foil by ultraviolet radiation.

The photoelectric effect tells us that:

Ek = Ephoton − φ

c

Ek = h − φ

We also have:

Work function of silver: φ = 6,9× 10−19 J

UV radiation wavelength = 250 nm = 250× 10−9 m

Planck's constant: h = 6,63× 10−34 m2kgs−1

speed of light: c = 3× 108 ms−1

Worked Example 190: The photoelectric effect - II

Question: If we were to shine the same ultraviolet radiation (f = 1,2× 1015 Hz),

on a gold foil (work function = 8,2× 10−19 J), would any electrons be emitted

from the surface of the gold foil?

Answer

For the electrons to be emitted from the surface, the energy of each photon needs

to be greater than the work function of the material.

Step 1 : Calculate the energy of the incident photons

Ephoton = hf

= 6,63× 10−34 × 1,2× 1015

= 7,96× 10−19 J

Therefore each photon of ultraviolet light has an energy of 7,96× 10−19 J.

Step 2 : Write down the work function for gold.

φgold = 8,2× 10−19 J

Step 3 : Is the energy of the photons greater or smaller than the work

function?

31.3CHAPTER 31. OPTICAL PHENOMENA AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER - GRADE 12

7,96× 10−19 J < 8,2× 10−19 J

Ephotons < φgold

The energy of each photon is less than the work function of gold. Therefore, the

photons do not have enough energy to knock electrons out of the gold. No

electrons would be emitted from the gold foil.

Extension: Units of energy

When dealing with calculations at a small scale (like at the level of electrons) it

is more convenient to use different units for energy rather than the Joule (J). We

define a unit called the electron-Volt (eV) as the kinetic energy gained by an

electron passing through a potential difference of one volt.

E = q × V

where q is the charge of the electron and V is the potential difference applied. The

charge of 1 electron is 1,6× 10−19 C, so 1 eV is calculated to be:

1 eV = (1,610−19 C× 1 V) = 1,6× 10−19 J

You can see that 1,6× 10−19 J is a very small amount of energy and so using

electron-Volts (eV) at this level is easier.

Hence, 1eV = 1.6× 10−19 J which means that 1 J = 6.241× 1018 eV
