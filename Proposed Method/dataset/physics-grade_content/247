14.1 Introduction

In Grade 10 we studied pulses and waves. We looked at transverse waves more closely. In this

chapter we look at another type of wave called longitudinal waves. In transverse waves, the

motion of the particles in the medium were perpendicular to the direction of the wave. In

longitudinal waves, the particles in the medium move parallel (in the same direction as) to the

motion of the wave. Examples of transverse waves are water waves or light waves. An example

of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave.
