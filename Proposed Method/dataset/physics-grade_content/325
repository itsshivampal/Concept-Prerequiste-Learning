19.5 Wheatstone bridge

Another method of finding an unknown resistance is to use a Wheatstone bridge. A

Wheatstone bridge is a measuring instrument that is used to measure an unknown electrical

resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown

component. Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer except that in potentiometer

circuits the meter used is a sensitive galvanometer.

Itneterreessttinigng The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and

FFacctt improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843.

In the circuit of the Wheatstone bridge, Rx is the unknown resistance. R1, R2 and R3 are

resistors of known resistance and the resistance of R2 is adjustable. If the ratio of R2:R1 is

equal to the ratio of Rx:R3, then the voltage between the two midpoints will be zero and no

current will flow between the midpoints. In order to determine the unknown resistance, R2 is

varied until this condition is reached. That is when the voltmeter reads 0 V.

Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem

The arrangement is a Wheatstone bridge. So we use the equation:

Rx : R3 = R2 : R1

Step 2 : Solve the problem

Rx : R3 = R2 : R1

Rx : 6 = 8 : 4

Rx = 12 Ω

Step 3 : Write the final answer

The resistance of the unknown resistor is 12 Ω.

Extension: Power in electric circuits

In addition to voltage and current, there is another measure of free electron

activity in a circuit: power. Power is a measure of how rapidly a standard amount

of work is done. In electric circuits, power is a function of both voltage and

current:

Definition: Electrical Power

Electrical power is calculated as:

P = I · V

Power (P ) is exactly equal to current (I) multiplied by voltage (V ) and there is

no extra constant of proportionality. The unit of measurement for power is the

Watt (abbreviated W).

Itneterreessttinigng It was James Prescott Joule, not Georg Simon Ohm, who first

FFacctt discovered the mathematical relationship between power dissipation

and current through a resistance. This discovery, published in 1841,

followed the form of the equation:

P = I2R

and is properly known as Joule's Law. However, these power

equations are so commonly associated with the Ohm's Law equations

relating voltage, current, and resistance that they are frequently

credited to Ohm.
