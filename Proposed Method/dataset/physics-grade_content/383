23.4 Power

Now that we understand the relationship between work and energy, we are ready to look at a

quantity that defines how long it takes for a certain amount of work to be done. For example,

a mother pushing a trolley full of groceries can take 30 s or 60 s to push the trolley down an

aisle. She does the same amount of work, but takes a different length of time. We use the idea

of power to describe the rate at which work is done.

Definition: Power

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is expended.

The mathematical definition for power is:

P = F · v (23.3)

(23.3) is easily derived from the definition of work. We know that:

W = F · d.

However, power is defined as the rate at which work is done. Therefore,

∆W

P = .

∆t

This can be written as:

∆W

P =

∆t

∆(F · d)

=

∆t

∆d

= F

∆t

= F · v

The unit of power is watt (symbol W).

Activity :: Investigation : Watt

Itneterreessttinigng The unit watt is named after Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt (19

FFacctt January 1736 - 19 August 1819) whose improvements to the steam engine were

fundamental to the Industrial Revolution. A key feature of it was that it

brought the engine out of the remote coal fields into factories.

Activity :: Research Project : James Watt

Write a short report 5 pages on the life of James Watt describing his many

other inventions.

Itneterreessttinigng Historically, the horsepower (symbol hp) was the unit used to describe the

FFacctt power delivered by a machine. One horsepower is equivalent to approximately

750 W. The horsepower is sometimes used in the motor industry to describe

the power output of an engine. Incidentally, the horsepower was derived by

James Watt to give an indication of the power of his steam engine in terms of

the power of a horse, which was what most people used to for example, turn a

mill wheel.

Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required.

Step 3 : Determine how to approach the problem
From the force diagram, we see that the weight of the box is acting at right angles
to the direction of motion. The weight does not contribute to the work done and
does not contribute to the power calculation.
We can therefore calculate power from:
P = F · v
Step 4 : Calculate the power required
P = F · v
= (10N)(1m · s−1)
= 10W
Step 5 : Write the final answer
10 W of power are required for a force of 10 N to move a 10 kg box at a speed of
1 ms over a frictionless surface.
Machines are designed and built to do work on objects. All machines usually have a power
rating. The power rating indicates the rate at which that machine can do work upon other
objects.
A car engine is an example of a machine which is given a power rating. The power rating
relates to how rapidly the car can accelerate. Suppose that a 50 kW engine could accelerate
the car from 0 km · hr−1 to 60km · hr−1 in 16 s. Then a car with four times the power rating
(i.e. 200 kW) could do the same amount of work in a quarter of the time. That is, a 200 kW
engine could accelerate the same car from 0 km · hr−1 to 60km · hr−1 in 4 s.
Worked Example 156: Power Calculation 2
Question: A forklift lifts a crate of mass 100 kg at a constant velocity to a height
of 8 m over a time of 4 s. The forklift then holds the crate in place for 20 s.
Calculate how much power the forklift exerts in lifting the crate? How much power
does the forklift exert in holding the crate in place?
Answer
Step 1 : Determine what is given and what is required
We are given:
• mass of crate: m=100 kg
• height that crate is raised: h=8 m
• time taken to raise crate: tr=4 s
• time that crate is held in place: ts=20 s
We are required to calculate the power exerted.
Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem
We can use:
∆x
P = F
∆t
to calculate power. The force required to raise the crate is equal to the weight of
the crate.
Step 3 : Calculate the power required to raise the crate

Step 4 : Calculate the power required to hold the crate in place
While the crate is being held in place, there is no displacement. This means there
is no work done on the crate and therefore there is no power exerted.
Step 5 : Write the final answer
1 960 W of power is exerted to raise the crate and no power is exerted to hold the
crate in place.
