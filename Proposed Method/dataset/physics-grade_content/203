12.3.6 Different types of forces

Tension

Tension is the magnitude of the force that exists in objects like ropes, chains and struts that are

providing support. For example, there are tension forces in the ropes supporting a child's swing

hanging from a tree.

Contact and non-contact forces

In this chapter we have come across a number of different types of forces, for example a push

or a pull, tension in a string, frictional forces and the normal. These are all examples of contact

forces where there is a physical point of contact between applying the force and the object.

Non-contact forces are forces that act over a distance, for example magnetic forces, electrostatic

forces and gravitational forces.

When an object is placed on a surface, two types of surface forces can be identified. Fric-

tion is a force that acts between the surface and the object and parallel to the surface. The

normal force is a force that acts between the object and the surface and parallel to the surface.

The normal force

A 5 kg box is placed on a rough surface and a 10 N force is applied at an angle of 36,9◦ to

the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal force (N or FN ) is the force between

the box and the surface acting in the vertical direction. If this force is not present the box

would fall through the surface because the force of gravity pulls it downwards. The normal force

therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal force by considering all the forces in the

vertical direction. All the forces in the vertical direction must add up to zero because there is

no movement in the vertical direction.

N + Fy + Fg = 0

N + 6 + (−49) = 0

N = 43N upwards

N 10 N Fy = 10 sin 36,9◦ = 6 N

Ff Fx = 10 cos 36,9◦ = 8 N5 kg

Fg = 5 x 9,8 = 49 N

Figure 12.12: Friction and the normal force

The most interesting and illustrative normal force question, that is often asked, has to do with

a scale in a lift. Using Newton's third law we can solve these problems quite easily.

When you stand on a scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no

acceleration downwards because there is a reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards

on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the gravitational force were less then

the reading on the scale would be less.

Worked Example 76: Normal Forces 1

Question: A man with a mass of 100 kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons).

What is the reading on the scale?

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for

We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts

on him is 9,8 = m·s−2.

Step 2 : Decide what equation to use to solve the problem

The scale measures the normal force on the man. This is the force that balances

gravity. We can use Newton's laws to solve the problem:

Fr = Fg + FN

forces and gravitational forces.
When an object is placed on a surface, two types of surface forces can be identified. Fric-
tion is a force that acts between the surface and the object and parallel to the surface. The
normal force is a force that acts between the object and the surface and parallel to the surface.
The normal force
A 5 kg box is placed on a rough surface and a 10 N force is applied at an angle of 36,9◦ to
the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal force (N or FN ) is the force between
the box and the surface acting in the vertical direction. If this force is not present the box
would fall through the surface because the force of gravity pulls it downwards. The normal force
therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal force by considering all the forces in the
vertical direction. All the forces in the vertical direction must add up to zero because there is
no movement in the vertical direction.
N + Fy + Fg = 0
N + 6 + (−49) = 0
N = 43N upwards
N 10 N Fy = 10 sin 36,9◦ = 6 N
Ff Fx = 10 cos 36,9◦ = 8 N5 kg
Fg = 5 x 9,8 = 49 N

Worked Example 76: Normal Forces 1
Question: A man with a mass of 100 kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons).
What is the reading on the scale?
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts
on him is 9,8 = m·s−2.
Step 2 : Decide what equation to use to solve the problem
The scale measures the normal force on the man. This is the force that balances
gravity. We can use Newton's laws to solve the problem:
Fr = Fg + FN
269
12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11
where Fr is the resultant force on the man.
Step 3 : Firstly we determine the force on the man due to gravity
Fg = mg
= (100 kg)(9,8m · s−2)
= 980 kg · m · s−2
= 980N downwards
Step 4 : Now determine the normal force acting upwards on the man
We now know the gravitational force downwards. We know that the sum of all the
forces must equal the resultant acceleration times the mass. The overall resultant
acceleration of the man on the scale is 0 - so Fr = 0.
Fr = Fg + FN
0 = −980N+ FN
FN = 980N upwards
Step 5 : Quote the final answer
The normal force is 980 N upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force
downwards so there is no net force and no acceleration on the man. The reading on
the scale is 980 N.
Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly.
We will now move to a lift moving at constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then
acceleration is zero.
Worked Example 77: Normal Forces 2
Question: A man with a mass of 100 kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons)
inside a lift that moving downwards at a constant velocity of 2 m·s−1. What is the
reading on the scale?
Answer
Step 6 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
We are given the mass of the man and the acceleration of the lift. We know the
gravitational acceleration that acts on him.
Step 7 : Decide which equation to use to solve the problem
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must
equal the resultant force, Fr .
Fr = Fg + FN
Step 8 : Determine the force due to gravity
Fg = mg
= (100 kg)(9,8m · s−2)
= 980 kg · m · s−2
= 980N downwards
Step 9 : Now determine the normal force acting upwards on the man
The scale measures this normal force, so once we have determined it we will know
the reading on the scale. Because the lift is moving at constant velocity the overall
270
CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3
resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is 0. If we write out the equation:
Fr = Fg + FN
ma = Fg + FN
(100)(0) = −980N+ FN
FN = 980N upwards
Step 10 : Quote the final answer
The normal force is 980 N upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force
downwards so there is no net force and no acceleration on the man. The reading on
the scale is 980 N.
In the previous two examples we got exactly the same result because the net acceleration on the
man was zero! If the lift is accelerating downwards things are slightly different and now we will
get a more interesting answer!
Worked Example 78: Normal Forces 3
Question: A man with a mass of 100 kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons)
inside a lift that is accelerating downwards at 2 m·s−2. What is the reading on the
scale?
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
We are given the mass of the man and his resultant acceleration - this is just the
acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration also acts on him.
Step 2 : Decide which equation to use to solve the problem
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must
equal the resultant force, Fr .
Fr = Fg + FN
Step 3 : Determine the force due to gravity, Fg
Fg = mg
= (100 kg)(9,8m · s−2)
= 980 kg · m · s−2
= 980N downwards
Step 4 : Determine the resultant force, Fr
The resultant force can be calculated by applying Newton's Second Law:
Fr = ma
Fr = (100)(−2)
= −200 N
= 200 N down
Step 5 : Determine the normal force, FN
The sum of all the vertical forces is equal to the resultant force, therefore
Fr = Fg + FN
−200 = −980 + FN
FN = 780N upwards
Step 6 : Quote the final answer
271
12.3 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11
The normal force is 780 N upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards
just enough so that the man only accelerates downwards at 2 m·s−2. The reading
on the scale is 780 N.
Worked Example 79: Normal Forces 4
Question: A man with a mass of 100 kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons)
inside a lift that is accelerating upwards at 4 m·s−2. What is the reading on the
scale?
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
We are given the mass of the man and his resultant acceleration - this is just the
acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration also acts on him.
Step 2 : Decide which equation to use to solve the problem
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must
equal the resultant force, Fr .
Fr = Fg + FN
Step 3 : Determine the force due to gravity, Fg
Fg = mg
= (100 kg)(9,8m · s−2)
= 980 kg · m · s−2
= 980N downwards
Step 4 : Determine the resultant force, Fr
The resultant force can be calculated by applying Newton's Second Law:
Fr = ma
Fr = (100)(4)
= 400 N upwards
Step 5 : Determine the normal force, FN
The sum of all the vertical forces is equal to the resultant force, therefore
Fr = Fg + FN
400 = −980 + FN
FN = 1380N upwards
Step 6 : Quote the final answer
The normal force is 1380 N upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards
and then in addition applies sufficient force to accelerate the man upwards at 4m·s−2.
The reading on the scale is 1380 N.
Friction forces
When the surface of one object slides over the surface of another, each body exerts a frictional
force on the other. For example if a book slides across a table, the table exerts a frictional
force onto the book and the book exerts a frictional force onto the table (Newton's Third Law).
Frictional forces act parallel to the surfaces.
272
CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3
A force is not always big enough to make an object move, for example a small applied force
might not be able to move a heavy crate. The frictional force opposing the motion of the crate
is equal to the applied force but acting in the opposite direction. This frictional force is called
static friction. When we increase the applied force (push harder), the frictional force will also
increase until the applied force overcomes it. This frictional force can vary from zero (when
no other forces are present and the object is stationary) to a maximum that depends on the
surfaces. When the applied force is greater than the frictional force and the crate will move.
The frictional force will now decrease to a new constant value which is also dependent on the
surfaces. This is called kinetic friction. In both cases the maximum frictional force is related to
the normal force and can be calculated as follows:
For static friction: Ff ≤ µs N
Where µs = the coefficient of static friction
and N = normal force
For kinetic friction: Ff = µk N
Where µk = the coefficient of kinetic friction
and N = normal force
Remember that static friction is present when the object is not moving and kinetic friction
while the object is moving. For example when you drive at constant velocity in a car on a tar
road you have to keep the accelerator pushed in slightly to overcome the kinetic friction between
the tar road and the wheels of the car. The higher the value for the coefficient of friction, the
more 'sticky' the surface is and the lower the value, the more 'slippery' the surface is.
The frictional force (Ff ) acts in the horizontal direction and can be calculated in a similar way
to the normal for as long as there is no movement. If we use the same example as in figure 12.12
and we choose to the right as positive,
Ff + Fx = 0
Ff + (+8) = 0
Ff = −8
Ff = 8N to the left
Worked Example 80: Forces on a slope
Question: A 50 kg crate is placed on a slope that makes an angle of 30◦ with the
horizontal. The box does not slide down the slope. Calculate the magnitude and
direction of the frictional force and the normal force present in this situation.
Answer
Step 1 : Draw a force diagram
Draw a force diagram and fill in all the details on the diagram. This makes it easier
to understand the problem.

The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface (and not vertically upwards).
It's magnitude is equal to the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope.

N = 224N perpendicular to the surface

Ff = 490 sin 30

Ff = 245N up the slope
We often think about friction in a negative way but very often friction is useful without us
realizing it. If there was no friction and you tried to prop a ladder up against a wall, it would
simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs. The brakes
of cars would be useless if it wasn't for friction!
Worked Example 81: Coefficients of friction
Question: A block of wood weighing 32 N is placed on a rough slope and a rope is
tied to it. The tension in the rope can be increased to 8 N before the block starts
to slide. A force of 4 N will keep the block moving at constant speed once it has
been set in motion. Determine the coefficients of static and kinetic friction.
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the question and determine what is asked
The weight of the block is given (32 N) and two situations are identified: One where
the block is not moving (applied force is 8 N), and one where the block is moving
(applied force is 4 N).
We are asked to find the coefficient for static friction µs and kinetic friction µk.

Note that the coefficient of friction does not have a unit as it shows a ratio. The value

for the coefficient of friction friction can have any value up to a maximum of 0,25.

When a force less than 8 N is applied, the coefficient of friction will be less than 0,25.
