4.3 Potential Energy

The potential energy of an object is generally defined as the energy an object has because of

its position relative to other objects that it interacts with. There are different kinds of potential

energy such as gravitional potential energy, chemical potential energy, electrical potential energy,

to name a few. In this section we will be looking at gravitational potential energy.

Definition: Potential energy

Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.

Gravitational potential energy is the energy of an object due to its position above the surface of

the Earth. The symbol PE is used to refer to gravitational potential energy. You will often find

that the words potential energy are used where gravitational potential energy is meant. We can

define potential energy (or gravitational potential energy, if you like) as:

PE = mgh (4.5)

where PE = potential energy measured in joules (J)

m = mass of the object (measured in kg)

g = gravitational acceleration (9,8 m·s−2)

h = perpendicular height from the reference point (measured in m)

A suitcase, with a mass of 1 kg, is placed at the top of a 2 m high cupboard. By lifting the

suitcase against the force of gravity, we give the suitcase potential energy. This potential energy

can be calculated using equation 4.5.

If the suitcase falls off the cupboard, it will lose its potential energy. Halfway down the cupboard,

the suitcase will have lost half its potential energy and will have only 9,8 J left. At the bottom

of the cupboard the suitcase will have lost all it's potential energy and it's potential energy will

be equal to zero.

Objects have maximum potential energy at a maximum height and will lose their potential

energy as they fall.

The potential energy is a maximum.

PE = mgh = 1 × 9,8 × 2 = 19,6 J

The potential energy is a minimum.

PE = mgh = 1 × 9,8 × 0 = 0 J

Worked Example 17: Gravitational potential energy

Question: A brick with a mass of 1 kg is lifted to the top of a 4 m high roof. It

slips off the roof and falls to the ground. Calculate the potential energy of the brick

at the top of the roof and on the ground once it has fallen.

Answer

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

• The mass of the brick is m = 1 kg

• The height lifted is h = 4 m

All quantities are in SI units.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

• We are asked to find the gain in potential energy of the brick as it is lifted onto

the roof.

• We also need to calculate the potential energy once the brick is on the ground

again.

Step 3 : Identify the type of potential energy involved

Since the block is being lifted we are dealing with gravitational potential energy. To

work out PE, we need to know the mass of the object and the height lifted. As

both of these are given, we just substitute them into the equation for PE.

Step 4 : Substitute and calculate

PE = mgh

= (1)(9,8)(4)

= 39,2 J
