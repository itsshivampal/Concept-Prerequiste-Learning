21.3 Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions

We have seen in Chapter ?? that the momentum of a system is conserved when there are no

external forces acting on the system. Conversely, an external force causes a change in

momentum ∆p, with the impulse delivered by the force, F acting for a time ∆t given by:

∆p = F ·∆t

The same principles that were studied in applying the conservation of momentum to problems

in one dimension, can be applied to solving problems in two dimensions.

The calculation of momentum is the same in two dimensions as in one dimension. The

calculation of momentum in two dimensions is broken down into determining the x and y

components of momentum and applying the conservation of momentum to each set of

components.

Consider two objects moving towards each other as shown in Figure 21.4. We analyse this

situation by calculating the x and y components of the momentum of each object.

x-component of momentum:

pi1x = m1vi1x = m1vi1 cos θ1

pi2x = m2ui2x = m2vi2 sin θ2

y-component of momentum:

pi1y = m1vi1y = m1vi1 cos θ1

pi2y = m2vi2y = m2vi2 sin θ2

After the collision

Total momentum:

pf1 = m1vf1

pf2 = m2vf2

x-component of momentum:

pf1x = m1vf1x = m1vf1 cosφ1

pf2x = m2vf2x = m2vf2 sinφ2

y-component of momentum:

pf1y = m1vf1y = m1vf1 cosφ1

pf2y = m2vf2y = m2vf2 sinφ2

Conservation of momentum

The initial momentum is equal to the final momentum:

pi = pf

pi = pi1 + pi2

pf = pf1 + pf2

This forms the basis of analysing momentum conservation problems in two dimensions.

piy2 = m2vi2y = 90× 8× cos 60◦
Step 3 : Now write down what we know about the final momentum:

Step 3 : Now write down what we know about the final momentum:

For Player 1:

pfx1 = m1vfx1 = 80× vfx1

pfy1 = m1vfy1 = 80× vfy1

For Player 2:

pfx2 = m2vfx2 = 80× (−0.3)× cos 60◦

pfy2 = m2vfy2 = 80× 6× sin 60◦

Step 4 : Use conservation of momentum:

The initial total momentum in the x direction is equal to the final total momentum

in the x direction.

The initial total momentum in the y direction is equal to the final total momentum

in the y direction.

If we find the final x and y components, then we can find the final total

momentum.

pix1 + pix2 = pfx1 + pfx2
