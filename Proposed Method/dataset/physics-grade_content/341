20.4.4 Forward biased

Forward-bias occurs when the p-type semiconductor material is connected to the positive

terminal of a battery and the n-type semiconductor material is connected to the negative

terminal.

The electric field from the external potential different can easily overcome the small internal

field (in the so-called depletion region, created by the initial drifting of charges): usually

anything bigger than 0.6V would be enough. The external field then attracts more e- to flow

from n-region to p-region and more holes from p-region to n-region and you have a forward

biased situation. the diode is ON.

20.4 The p-n junction

20.4.1 Differences between p- and n-type semi-conductors

We have seen that the addition of specific elements to semiconductor materials turns them into

p-type semiconductors or n-type semiconductors. The differences between n- and p-type

semiconductors are summarised in Table ??.

20.4.2 The p-n Junction

When p-type and n-type semiconductors are placed in contact with each other, a p-n junction

is formed. Near the junction, electrons and holes combine to create a depletion region.

Figure 20.4: The p-n junction forms between p- and n-type semiconductors. The free electrons

from the n-type material combine with the holes in the p-type material near the junction. There

is a small potential difference across the junction. The area near the junction is called the

depletion region because there are few holes and few free electrons in this region.

Electric current flows more easily across a p-n junction in one direction than in the other. If the

positive pole of a battery is connected to the p-side of the junction, and the negative pole to

the n-side, charge flows across the junction. If the battery is connected in the opposite

direction, very little charge can flow.

This might not sound very useful at first but the p-n junction forms the basis for computer

chips, solar cells, and other electronic devices.

20.4.3 Unbiased

In a p-n junction, without an external applied voltage (no bias), an equilibrium condition is

reached in which a potential difference is formed across the junction.

P-type is where you have more "holes"; N-type is where you have more electrons in the

material. Initially, when you put them together to form a junction, holes near the junction

tends to "move" across to the N-region, while the electrons in the N-region drift across to the

p-region to "fill" some holes. This current will quickly stop as the potential barrier is built up

by the migrated charges. So in steady state no current flows.

Then now when you put a potential different across the terminals you have two cases: forward

biased and reverse biased.

20.4.4 Forward biased

Forward-bias occurs when the p-type semiconductor material is connected to the positive

terminal of a battery and the n-type semiconductor material is connected to the negative

terminal.
