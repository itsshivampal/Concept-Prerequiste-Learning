31.4.2 Absorption spectra

As you know, atoms do not only emit photons; they also absorb photons. If a photon hits an

atom and the energy of the photon is the same as the gap between two electron energy levels

in the atom, then the electron can absorb the photon and jump up to the higher energy level.

If the atom has no energy level differences that equal the incoming photon's energy, it cannot

absorb the photon, and can only scatter it.

Using this effect, if we have a source of photons of various energies we can obtain the

absorption spectra for different materials. To get an absorption spectrum, just shine white

light on a sample of the material that you are interested in. White light is made up of all the

different wavelengths of visible light put together. In the absorption spectrum, the energy levels

corresponding to the absorbed photons show up as black lines because the photons of these

wavelengths have been absorbed and don't show up. Because of this, the absorption spectrum

is the exact inverse of the emission spectrum. Look at the two figures below. In figure 31.6 you

can see the emission lines of hyrodrogen. Figure 31.7 shows the absorption spectrum. It is the

exact opposite of the emission spectrum! Both emission and absorption techniques can be used

to get the same information about the energy levels of an atom.

Worked Example 191: Absorption

Question: I have an unknown gas in a glass container. I shine a bright white light

through one side of the container and measure the spectrum of transmitted light. I

notice that there is a black line (absorption line) in the middle of the visible red

band at 642 nm. I have a hunch that the gas might be hydrogen. If I am correct,

between which 2 energy levels does this transition occur? (Hint: look at figure 31.5

and the transitions which are in the visible part of the spectrum.)

Answer

Step 1 : What is given and what needs to be done?

We have an absorption line at 642 nm. This means that the substance in the glass

container absorbed photons with a wavelength of 642 nm. We need to calculate

which 2 energy levels of hydrogen this transition would correspond to. Therefore

we need to know what energy the absorbed photons had.

Step 2 : Calculate the energy of the absorbed photons

hc

E =

λ

(6,63× 10−34)× (3× 108)

=

642× 10−9

= 3,1× 10−19 J

The absorbed photons had energy of 3,1× 10−19

Step 3 : Find the energy of the transitions resulting in radiation at visible

wavelengths

Figure 31.5 shows various energy level transitions. The transitions related to visible

wavelengths are marked as the transitions beginning or ending on Energy Level 2.

Let's find the energy of those transitions and compare with the energy of the

absorbed photons we've just calculated.

Energy of transition (absorption) from Energy Level 2 to Energy Level 3:

E2 = E3 2 − E3

= 16,3× 10−19 J− 19,4× 10−19 J

= −3,1× 10−19 J

Therefore the energy of the photon that an electron must absorb to jump from

Energy Level 2 to Energy Level 3 is 3,1× 10−19 J. (NOTE: The minus sign means

that absorption is occurring.)

This is the same energy as the photons which were absorbed by the gas in the

container! Therefore, since the transitions of all elements are unique, we can say

that the gas in the container is hydrogen. The transition is absorption of a photon

between Energy Level 2 and Energy Level 3.
