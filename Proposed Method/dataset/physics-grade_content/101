7.4.2 Snell's Law

Now that we know that the degree of bending, or the angle of refraction, is dependent on the

refractive index of a medium, how do we calculate the angle of refraction?

The angles of incidence and refraction when light travels from one medium to another can be

calculated using Snell's Law.

Definition: Snell's Law

n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2

where

n1 = Refractive index of material 1

n2 = Refractive index of material 2

θ1 = Angle of incidence

θ2 = Angle of refraction

Remember that angles of incidence and refraction are measured from the normal, which is an

imaginary line perpendicular to the surface.

Suppose we have two media with refractive indices n1 and n2. A light ray is incident on the

surface between these materials with an angle of incidence θ1. The refracted ray that passes

through the second medium will have an angle of refraction θ2.

Worked Example 32: Using Snell's Law

Question: A light ray with an angle of incidence of 35◦ passes from water to air.

Find the angle of refraction using Snell's Law and Table 7.4.1. Discuss the meaning

of your answer.

Answer

Step 1 : Determine the refractive indices of water and air

From Table 7.4.1, the refractive index is 1,333 for water and about 1 for air. We

know the angle of incidence, so we are ready to use Snell's Law.

Step 2 : Substitute values

Answer

According to Snell's Law:

1,33 sin35◦ = 1 sin θ2
sin θ2 = 0,763
θ2 = 49,7
◦.
Step 3 : Discuss the answer
The light ray passes from a medium of high refractive index to one of low refractive
index. Therefore, the light ray is bent away from the normal.
Worked Example 33: Using Snell's Law
Question: A light ray passes from water to diamond with an angle of incidence of
75◦. Calculate the angle of refraction. Discuss the meaning of your answer.
Answer
Step 1 : Determine the refractive indices of water and air
From Table 7.4.1, the refractive index is 1,333 for water and 2,42 for diamond. We
know the angle of incidence, so we are ready to use Snell's Law.
Step 2 : Substitute values and solve
According to Snell's Law:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
1,33 sin75◦ = 2,42 sin θ2
sin θ2 = 0,531
θ2 = 32,1
◦.
Step 3 : Discuss the answer
The light ray passes from a medium of low refractive index to one of high refractive
index. Therefore, the light ray is bent towards the normal.
If
n2 > n1
then from Snell's Law,
sin θ1 > sin θ2.
For angles smaller than 90◦, sin θ increases as θ increases. Therefore,
θ1 > θ2.
This means that the angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction and the light ray
is bent toward the normal.
Similarly, if
n2 < n1
then from Snell's Law,
sin θ1 < sin θ2.
For angles smaller than 90◦, sin θ increases as θ increases. Therefore,
θ1 < θ2.

This shows that if the light ray is incident at 0◦, then the angle of refraction is also 0◦. The ray
passes through the surface unchanged, i.e. no refraction occurs.
