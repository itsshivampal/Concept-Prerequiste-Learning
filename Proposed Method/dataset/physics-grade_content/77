6.2 CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10

In the activity the distance between the indicated points was the same. These points are then

said to be in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an integer (0,1,2,3,...) number of

complete wave cycles. They do not have to be peaks or troughs, but they must be separated by

a complete number of wavelengths.

We then have an alternate definition of the wavelength as the distance between any two adjacent

points which are in phase.

Definition: Wavelength of wave

The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two adjacent points that are in phase.

Points that are not in phase, those that are not separated by a complete number of wavelengths,

are called out of phase. Examples of points like these would be A and C, or D and E, or B and

H in the Activity.

CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10 6.2

Worked Example 26: Wavelength

Question: The total distance between 4 consecutive peaks of a transverse wave is

6m. What is the wavelength of the wave?

Answer

Step 1 : Draw a rough sketch of the situation

6m

λ λ λ

equilibrium

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

From the sketch we see that 4 consecutive peaks is equivalent to 3 wavelengths.

Step 3 : Solve the problem

Therefore, the wavelength of the wave is:

3λ = 6m
