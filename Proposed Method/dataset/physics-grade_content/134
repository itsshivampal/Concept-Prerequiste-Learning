9.6 Conductors and insulators

All atoms are electrically neutral i.e. they have the same amounts of negative and positive charge

inside them. By convention, the electrons carry negative charge and the protons carry positive

charge. The basic unit of charge, called the elementary charge, e, is the amount of charge carried

by one electron.

All the matter and materials on earth are made up of atoms. Some materials allow electrons to

move relatively freely through them (e.g. most metals, the human body). These materials are

called conductors.

Other materials do not allow the charge carriers, the electrons, to move through them (e.g.

plastic, glass). The electrons are bound to the atoms in the material. These materials are called

non-conductors or insulators.

If an excess of charge is placed on an insulator, it will stay where it is put and there will be a

concentration of charge in that area of the object. However, if an excess of charge is placed on

a conductor, the like charges will repel each other and spread out over the surface of the object.

When two conductors are made to touch, the total charge on them is shared between the two.

If the two conductors are identical, then each conductor will be left with half of the total charge.

Extension: Charge and electrons

The basic unit of charge, namely the elementary charge is carried by the electron

(equal to 1.602×10−19 C!). In a conducting material (e.g. copper), when the atoms

bond to form the material, some of the outermost, loosely bound electrons become

detached from the individual atoms and so become free to move around. The charge

carried by these electrons can move around in the material. In insulators, there are

very few, if any, free electrons and so the charge cannot move around in the material.

Worked Example 42: Conducting spheres and movement of charge

Question: I have 2 charged metal conducting spheres. Sphere A has a charge of -5

nC and sphere B has a charge of -3 nC. I then bring the spheres together so that

they touch each other. Afterwards I move the two spheres apart so that they are no

longer touching.

1. What happens to the charge on the two spheres?

2. What is the final charge on each sphere?

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what is known and what question/s we need to answer:

We have two identical negatively charged conducting spheres which are brought

together to touch each other and then taken apart again. We need to explain what

9.6 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROSTATICS - GRADE 10

happens to the charge on each sphere and what the final charge on each sphere is

after they are moved apart.

Step 2 : What concept is being used?

We know that the charge carriers in conductors are free to move around and that

charge on a conductor spreads itself out on the surface of the conductor.

Step 3 : Use the concept to find the answer

1. When the two conducting spheres are brought together to touch, it is as though

they become one single big conductor and the total charge of the two spheres

spreads out across the whole surface of the touching spheres. When the spheres

are moved apart again, each one is left with half of the total original charge.

2. Before the spheres touch, the total charge is: -5 nC + (-3) nC = -8 nC. When

they touch they share out the -8 nC across their whole surface. When they are

removed from each other, each is left with half of the original charge:

−8 nC /2 = −4 nC

on each sphere.

straw.
