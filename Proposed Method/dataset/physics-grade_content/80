6.3 Graphs of Particle Motion

In Chapter 5, we saw that when a pulse moves through a medium, there are two different motions:

the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the pulse. These two motions are

at right angles to each other when the pulse is transverse. Since a transverse wave is a series of

transverse pulses, the particle in the medium and the wave move in exactly the same way as for

the pulse.

When a transverse wave moves through the medium, the particles in the medium only move up

and down. We can see this in the figure below, which shows the motion of a single particle as a

transverse wave moves through the medium.

Important: A particle in the medium only moves up and down when a transverse wave

moves through the medium.

As in Chapter 3, we can draw a graph of the particles' position as a function of time. For the

wave shown in the above figure, we can draw the graph shown below.

The graph of the particle's velocity as a function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of

the position vs. time graph. The graph of velocity vs. time for the position vs. time graph

Extension: Mathematical Description of Waves
If you look carefully at the pictures of waves you will notice that they look very
much like sine or cosine functions. This is correct. Waves can be described by
trigonometric functions that are functions of time or of position. Depending on
which case we are dealing with the function will be a function of t or x. For example,
a function of position would be:
x
y(x) = A sin(k )
λ
while a function of time would be:
t
y(t) = A sin(k )
T
Descriptions of the wave incorporate the amplitude, wavelength, frequency or period
and a phase shift.
