18.4.1 Real-world applications

Transformers are very important in the supply of electricity nationally. In order to reduce energy

losses due to heating, electrical energy is transported from power stations along power lines at

high voltage and low current. Transformers are used to step the voltage up from the power

station to the power lines, and step it down from the power lines to buildings where it is needed.

Exercise: Transformers

1. Draw a sketch of the main features of a transformer

2. Use Faraday's Law to explain how a transformer works in words and pictures.

3. Use the equation for Faraday's Law to derive an expression involving the ratio

between the voltages and number of windings in the primary and secondary

coils.

4. If we have Np = 100 and Ns = 50 and we connect the primary winding to a

230 V, 50Hz supply then calculate the voltage on the secondary winding.

5. State the difference between a step-up and a step-down transformer in both

structure and function.

6. Give an example of the use of transformers.
