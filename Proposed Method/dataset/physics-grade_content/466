Definition: Planck's constant

Planck's constant is a physical constant named after Max Planck.

h = 6,626× 10−34 J · s

The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula: E = hf or E = h c . Where E is

λ

the energy of the photon in joules (J), h is planck's constant, c is the speed of light, f is the

frequency in hertz (Hz) and λ is the wavelength in metres (m).

Worked Example 187: Calculating the energy of a photon I

Question: Calculate the energy of a photon with a frequency of 3× 1018 Hz

Answer

We use the formula: E = hf

E = hf

= 6,6× 10−34 × 3× 1018

= 2× 10−15 J

Worked Example 188: Calculating the energy of a photon II

Question: What is the energy of an ultraviolet photon with a wavelength of

200 nm?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required and how to approach the problem.

We are required to calculate the energy associated with a photon of ultraviolet

light with a wavelength of 200 nm.

We can use:

c

E = h

λ

Step 2 : Solve the problem

c

E = h

λ

= (6,626× 10−34)

200× 10−9

= 9,939× 10−10 J
