7.7 Summary

1. We can see objects when light from the objects enters our eyes.

2. Light rays are thin imaginary lines of light and are indicated in drawings by means of

arrows.

3. Light travels in straight lines. Light can therefore not travel around corners. Shadows are

formed because light shines in straight lines.

4. Light rays reflect off surfaces. The incident ray shines in on the surface and the reflected

ray is the one that bounces off the surface. The surface normal is the perpendicular line

to the surface where the light strikes the surface.

5. The angle of incidence is the angle between the incident ray and the surface, and the angle

of reflection is the angle between the reflected ray and the surface.

6. The Law of Reflection states the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection and

that the reflected ray lies in the plane of incidence.

7. Specular reflection takes place when parallel rays fall on a surface and they leave the object

as parallel rays. Diffuse reflection takes place when parallel rays are reflected in different

directions.

8. Refraction is the bending of light when it travels from one medium to another. Light

travels at different speeds in different media.

9. The refractive index of a medium is a measure of how easily light travels through the

medium. It is a ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the

medium.

n = cv

10. Snell's Law gives the relationship between the refractive indices, angles of incidence and

reflection of two media.

n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2

11. Light travelling from one medium to another of lighter optical density will be refracted

towards the normal.

Light travelling from one medium to another of lower optical density will be refracted away

from the normal.

12. Objects in a medium (e.g. under water) appear closer to the surface than they really are.

This is due to the refraction of light, and the refractive index of the medium.

n = real depthapparent depth

13. Mirrors are highly reflective surfaces. Flat mirrors are called plane mirrors. Curved mirrors

can be convex or concave. The properties of the images formed by mirrors are summarised

in Table 3.2.

14. A real image can be cast on a screen, is inverted and in front of the mirror.

A virtual image cannot be cast on a screen, is upright and behind the mirror.

15. The magnification of a mirror is how many times the image is bigger or smaller than the

object.

m = image height (hi)object height (h0)

16. The critical angle of a medium is the angle of incidence when the angle of refraction is

90◦ and the refracted ray runs along the interface between the two media.

17. Total internal reflection takes place when light travels from one medium to another of

lower optical density. If the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle for the

medium, the light will be reflected back into the medium. No refraction takes place.

18. Total internal reflection is used in optical fibres in telecommunication and in medicine in

endoscopes. Optical fibres transmit information much more quickly and accurately than

traditional methods.
