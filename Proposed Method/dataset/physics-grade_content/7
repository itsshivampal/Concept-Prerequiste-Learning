2.4 CHAPTER 2. UNITS

2.4 Combinations of SI Base Units

To make working with units easier, some combinations of the base units are given special names,

but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 2.2 lists some examples

of combinations of SI base units that are assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the

formulae look unfamiliar at this stage - we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as

well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to recognise the units correctly. For instance, the new-

ton (N) is another name for the kilogram metre per second squared (kg·m·s−2), while the

kilogram metre squared per second squared (kg·m2 ·s−2) is called the joule (J).

Table 2.2: Some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned special names

Important: When writing combinations of base SI units, place a dot (·) between the units

to indicate that different base units are used. For example, the symbol for metres per second

is correctly written as m·s−1, and not as ms−1 or m/s.
