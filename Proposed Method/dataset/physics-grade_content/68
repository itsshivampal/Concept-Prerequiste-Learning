Activity :: Investigation : Reflection of a Pulse from a Fixed End

Tie a rope to a wall or some other object that cannot move. Create a pulse in

the rope by flicking one end up and down. Observe what happens to the pulse when

it reaches the wall.

Figure 5.9: Reflection of a pulse from a fixed end.

When the end of the medium is fixed, for example a rope tied to a wall, a pulse reflects from

the fixed end, but the pulse is inverted (i.e. it is upside-down). This is shown in Figure 5.9.

Figure 5.8: Reflection and transmission of a pulse at the boundary between two media.

When a pulse moves from a thick rope to a thinner one, the opposite happens. The pulse speed

will increase and the pulse length will decrease.

When the speed of the pulse increases, the pulse length will decrease. If the speed decreases,

the pulse length will increase. The incident pulse is the one that arrives at the boundary. The

reflected pulse is the one that moves back, away from the boundary. The transmitted pulse

is the one that moves into the new medium, away from the boundary.

Exercise: Pulses at a Boundary I

1. Fill in the blanks or select the correct answer: A pulse in a heavy rope is

traveling towards the boundary with a thin piece of string.

(a) The reflected pulse in the heavy rope will/will not be inverted because

.

(b) The speed of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the speed of the incident pulse.

(c) The speed of the reflected pulse will be greater than/less than/the same

as the speed of the incident pulse.

(d) The pulse length of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the pulse length of the incident pulse.

(e) The frequency of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the frequency of the incident pulse.

2. A pulse in a light string is traveling towards the boundary with a heavy rope.

(a) The reflected pulse in the light rope will/will not be inverted because

.

(b) The speed of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the speed of the incident pulse.

(c) The speed of the reflected pulse will be greater than/less than/the same

as the speed of the incident pulse.

(d) The pulse length of the transmitted pulse will be greater than/less than/the

same as the pulse length of the incident pulse.

5.6 Reflection of a Pulse from Fixed and Free Ends

Let us now consider what happens to a pulse when it reaches the end of a medium. The medium

can be fixed, like a rope tied to a wall, or it can be free, like a rope tied loosely to a pole.
