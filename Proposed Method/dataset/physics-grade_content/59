5.2 What is a medium?

In this chapter, as well as in the following chapters, we will speak about waves moving in a

medium. A medium is just the substance or material through which waves move. In other words

the medium carries the wave from one place to another. The medium does not create the wave

and the medium is not the wave. Air is a medium for sound waves, water is a medium for water

waves and rock is a medium for earthquakes (which are also a type of wave). Air, water and

rock are therefore examples of media (media is the plural of medium).

Definition: Medium

A medium is the substance or material in which a wave will move.

In each medium, the atoms that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest

position. In order for a wave to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact

with each other.
