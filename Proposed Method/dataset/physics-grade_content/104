7.5.1 Image Formation

Definition: Image

An image is a representation of an object formed by a mirror or lens. Light from the image

is seen.

If you place a candle in front of a mirror, you now see two candles. The actual, physical candle

is called the object and the picture you see in the mirror is called the image. The object is the

source of the incident rays. The image is the picture that is formed by the reflected rays.

The object could be an actual source that emits light, such as a light bulb or a candle. More

commonly, the object reflects light from another source. When you look at your face in the

mirror, your face does not emit light. Instead, light from a light bulb or from the sun reflects off

your face and then hits the mirror. However, in working with light rays, it is easiest to pretend

the light is coming from the object.

An image formed by reflection may be real or virtual. A real image occurs when light rays

actually intersect at the image. A real image is inverted, or upside down. A virtual image occurs

when light rays do not actually meet at the image. Instead, you "see" the image because your

eye projects light rays backward. You are fooled into seeing an image! A virtual image is erect,

or right side up (upright).

You can tell the two types apart by putting a screen at the location of the image. A real image

can be formed on the screen because the light rays actually meet there. A virtual image cannot

be seen on a screen, since it is not really there.

To describe objects and images, we need to know their locations and their sizes. The distance

from the mirror to the object is the object distance, do.

The distance from the mirror to the image is the image distance, di.

(c) Does the light bend towards the normal, away from the normal, or not at

all?

11. Light is incident on a glass prism. The prism is surrounded by air. The angle of

incidence is 23◦. Calculate the angle of reflection and the angle of refraction.

12. Light is refracted at the interface between air and an unknown medium. If

the angle of incidence is 53◦ and the angle of refraction is 37◦, calculate the

refractive index of the unknown, second medium.

13. A coin is placed in a bowl of acetone (n = 1,36). The coin appears to be 10

cm deep. What is the depth of the acetone?

14. A dot is drawn on a piece of paper and a glass prism placed on the dot according

to the diagram.

(a) Use the information supplied to determine the refractive index of glass.

(b) Draw a ray diagram to explain how the image of the dot is above where

the dot really is.

15. Light is refracted at the interface between a medium of refractive index 1,5

and a second medium of refractive index 2,1. If the angle of incidence is 45◦,

calculate the angle of refraction.

16. A ray of light strikes the interface between air and diamond. If the incident

ray makes an angle of 30◦ with the interface, calculate the angle made by the

refracted ray with the interface.

17. Challenge Question: What values of n are physically impossible to achieve?

Explain your answer. The values provide the limits of possible refractive indices.

18. Challenge Question: You have been given a glass beaker full of an unknown

liquid. How would you identify what the liquid is? You have the following

pieces of equipment available for the experiment: a laser, a protractor, a ruler,

a pencil, and a reference guide containing optical properties of various liquids.

7.5 Mirrors

A mirror is a highly reflective surface. The most common mirrors are flat and are known as

plane mirrors. Household mirrors are plane mirrors. They are made of a flat piece of glass with

a thin layer of silver nitrate or aluminium on the back. However, other mirrors are curved and

are either convex mirrors or are concave mirrors. The reflecting properties of all three types

of mirrors will be discussed in this section.
