7.5.8 Magnification

In Figures 7.19 and 7.21, the height of the object and image arrows were different. In any optical

system where images are formed from objects, the ratio of the image height, hi, to the object

height, ho is known as the magnification, m.

hi

m =

ho

This is true for the mirror examples we showed above and will also be true for lenses, which will

be introduced in the next sections. For a plane mirror, the height of the image is the same as the

CHAPTER 7. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS - GRADE 10 7.5

height of the object, so the magnification is simply m = hih = 1. If the magnification is greatero

than 1, the image is larger than the object and is said to be magnified. If the magnification is

less than 1, the image is smaller than the object so the image is said to be diminished.

Worked Example 36: Magnification

Question: A concave mirror forms an image that is 4,8 cm high. The height of the

object is 1,6 cm. Calculate the magnification of the mirror.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what is given and what is asked.

Image height hi = 4,8 cm

Object height ho = 1,6 cm

Magnification m = ?

Step 2 : Substitute the values and calculate m.

hi

m =

ho

4,8

=

1,6

= 3

The magnification is 3 times.
