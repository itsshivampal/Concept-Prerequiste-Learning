28.4.1 Capacitance

You have learnt about capacitance and capacitors in Grade 11. Please read through

section 17.5 to recap what you learnt about capacitance in a DC circuit.

In this section you will learn about capacitance in an AC circuit. A capacitor in an AC circuit

has reactance. Reactance in an AC circuit plays a similar role to resistance in a DC circuit.

The reactance of a capacitor XC is defined as:

XC =

1

2Ï€fC

where C is the capacitance and f is the AC frequency.

If we examine the equation for the reactance of a capacitor, we see that the frequency is in the

denominator. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the capacitive reactance is very high. This

is why a capacitor blocks the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance increases

with decreasing frequency.

When the frequency is high, the capacitive reactance is low. This is why a capacitor allows the

flow of high frequency AC because its reactance decreases with increasing frequency.
