16.3 Standing Waves in Wind Instruments

A wind instrument is an instrument that is usually made with a a pipe or thin tube. Examples

of wind instruments are recorders, clarinets, flutes, organs etc.

When one plays a wind instrument, the air that is pushed through the pipe vibrates and

standing waves are formed. Just like with strings, the wavelengths of the standing waves will

depend on the length of the pipe and whether it is open or closed at each end. Let's consider

each of the following situations:

• A pipe with both ends open, like a flute or organ pipe.

• A pipe with one end open and one closed, like a clarinet.

If you blow across a small hole in a pipe or reed, it makes a sound. If both ends are open,

standing waves will form according to figure 16.2. You will notice that there is an anti-node at

each end. In the next activity you will find how this affects the wavelengths.

This chart shows some standing waves in a pipe open at both ends. The pipe

(shown with dashed lines) has length L.

1. Fill in the:

2. Use the chart to find a formula for the wavelength in terms of the number of

nodes.

The formula is different because there are more anti-nodes than nodes. The right formula is:

λn =

Here, n is still the number of nodes.

of sound in air is 345 m.s−1. Can this pipe play

Question:

middle C? (Middle C has a frequency of about

262 Hz)

Answer

The main frequency of a note is the fundamental frequency. The fundamental

frequency of the open pipe has one node.

Step 1 : To find the frequency we will use the equation:

We need to find the wavelength first.

This is lower than 262 Hz, so this pipe will not play middle C. We will need a
shorter pipe for a higher pitch.
Worked Example 107: The Flute
A flute can be modeled as a metal pipe open at
both ends. (One end looks closed but the flute
has an embouchure, or hole for the player to
Question: blow across. This hole is large enough for air to
escape on that side as well.) If the fundamental
note of a flute is middle C, how long is the flute?
The speed of sound in air is 345 m.s−1.

We can calculate the length of the flute from λ = 2L but

Now let's look at a pipe that is open on one end and closed on the other. This pipe has a node
at one end and an antinode at the other. An example of a musical instrument that has a node

A long wavelength has a low frequency and low pitch. If you took your pipe from the last
example and covered one end, you should hear a much lower note! Also, the wavelengths of
the harmonics for this tube are not integer multiples of each other.
Worked Example 108: The Clarinet
Question: A clarinet can be modeled as a wooden pipe closed on one end and open
on the other. The player blows into a small slit on one end. A reed then vibrates in
the mouthpiece. This makes the standing wave in the air. What is the fundamental
frequency of a clarinet 60 cm long? The speed of sound in air is 345 m.s−1.
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what is given and what is asked:
We are given:
L = 60 cm
v = 345 m.s−1
f = ?
Step 2 : To find the frequency we will use the equation f = v but we need

This is closest to the D below middle C. This note is one of the lowest notes on a
clarinet.
Extension: Musical Scale
The 12 tone scale popular in Western music took centuries to develop. This
scale is also called the 12-note Equal Tempered scale. It has an octave divided into
12 steps. (An octave is the main interval of most scales. If you double a frequency,
you have raised the note one octave.) All steps have equal ratios of frequencies.
But this scale is not perfect. If the octaves are in tune, all the other intervals are
slightly mistuned. No interval is badly out of tune. But none is perfect.
For example, suppose the base note of a scale is a frequency of 110 Hz ( a low
A). The first harmonic is 220 Hz. This note is also an A, but is one octave higher.
The second harmonic is at 330 Hz (close to an E). The third is 440 Hz (also an A).
But not all the notes have such simple ratios. Middle C has a frequency of about
262 Hz. This is not a simple multiple of 110 Hz. So the interval between C and A
is a little out of tune.
Many other types of tuning exist. Just Tempered scales are tuned so that all
intervals are simple ratios of frequencies. There are also equal tempered scales with
more or less notes per octave. Some scales use as many as 31 or 53 notes.
