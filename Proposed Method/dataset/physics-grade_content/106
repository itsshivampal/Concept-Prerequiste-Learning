7.5.3 Ray Diagrams

We draw ray diagrams to predict the image that is formed by a plane mirror. A ray diagram is

a geometrical picture that is used for analyzing the images formed by mirrors and lenses. We

draw a few characteristic rays from the object to the mirror. We then follow ray-tracing rules to

find the path of the rays and locate the image.

Important: A mirror obeys the Law of Reflection.

The ray diagram for the image formed by a plane mirror is the simplest possible ray diagram.

Figure 7.15 shows an object placed in front of a plane mirror. It is convenient to have a central

line that runs perpendicular to the mirror. This imaginary line is called the principal axis.

Important: Ray diagrams

The following should be remembered when drawing ray diagrams:

1. Objects are represented by arrows. The length of the arrow represents the height of

the object.

2. If the arrow points upwards, then the object is described as upright or erect. If the

arrow points downwards then the object is described as inverted.

3. If the object is real, then the arrow is drawn with a solid line. If the object is virtual,

then the arrow is drawn with a dashed line.

Ray diagrams are used to find the position and size and whether the image is real or virtual.

1. Draw the plane mirror as a straight line on a principal axis.

2. Draw the object as an arrow in front of the mirror.

3. Draw the image of the object, by using the principle that the image is placed at the same

distance behind the mirror that the object is in front of the mirror. The image size is also

the same as the object size.

5. Pick one point on the image and draw the reflected ray that travels to the eye as it sees

this point. Remember to add an arrowhead.

Figure 7.15: Ray diagram to predict the image formed by a plane mirror.

Suppose a light ray leaves the top of the object traveling parallel to the principal axis. The ray

will hit the mirror at an angle of incidence of 0 degrees. We say that the ray hits the mirror

normally. According to the law of reflection, the ray will be reflected at 0 degrees. The ray then

bounces back in the same direction. We also project the ray back behind the mirror because this

is what your eye does.

Another light ray leaves the top of the object and hits the mirror at its centre. This ray will be

reflected at the same angle as its angle of incidence, as shown. If we project the ray backward

behind the mirror, it will eventually cross the projection of the first ray we drew. We have found

the location of the image! It is a virtual image since it appears in an area that light cannot

actually reach (behind the mirror). You can see from the diagram that the image is erect and is

the same size as the object. This is exactly as we expected.

We use a dashed line to indicate that the image is virtual.
