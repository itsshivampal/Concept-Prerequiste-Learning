29.3.2 LRC Circuits, Resonance and Signal Tuning

A circuit containing a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor all in series is called an LRC circuit.

Because the components are in series, the current through each component at a particular time

will be the same as the current through the others. The voltage across the resistor will be in

phase with the current. The voltage across the inductor will be 90◦ ahead of the current (the

current always follows or lags the voltage in an inductor). The voltage across the capacitor will

be 90◦ behind the current (the current leads the voltage for a capacitor). The phases of the

three voltages are shown in Figure 29.7.

Figure 29.7: The voltages across the separate components of an LRC circuit. Looking at the

peaks, you see that the voltage across the inductor VL ‘peaks' first, followed 90

◦ later by the

current I, followed 90◦ later by the voltage across the capacitor VC . The voltage across the

resistor is not shown - it is in phase with the current and peaks at the same time as the current.

The reactance of the inductor is 2πfL, and the reactance of the capacitor is 1/2πfC but with
the opposite phase. So the total reactance of the LRC circuit is
X = XL −XC = 2πfL− 1
2πfC
The impedance of the circuit as a whole is given by
√ √( )21
Z = X2 +R2 = 2πfL− +R2
2πfC
At different frequencies, the impedance will take different values. The impedance will have its
smallest value when the positive inductive reactance cancels out the negative capacitive
reactance. This occurs when
1
2πfL =
2πfC
so the frequency of minimum impedance must be
f = √1
2π LC
This is called the resonant frequency of the circuit. This is the frequency at which you can
get the largest current for a particular supply voltage. It is also called the natural frequency
of the circuit. This means the frequency at which the circuit would oscillate by itself.
Definition: Resonance
Resonance occurs when a circuit is connected to an alternating voltage at its natural fre-
quency. A very large current in the circuit can build up, even with minimal power input.
An LRC circuit is very useful when we have a signal containing many different frequencies, and
we only want one of them. If a signal like this is connected to an LRC circuit, then only the
resonant frequency (and other frequencies close to it) will drive measureable currents. This
means that an LRC circuit can select one frequency from a range. This process is called signal
tuning.
Itneterreessttinigng When you set up a radio antenna, and amplify the radio signal it receives, you
FFacctt find many different bands of frequencies - one from each radio station. When
you listen to the radio, you only want to listen to one station. An LRC circuit
in the radio (the tuning circuit) is set so that its resonant frequency is the
frequency of the station you want to listen to. This means that of the many
radio stations broadcasting, you only hear one. When you adjust the tuning
dial on the radio, it changes the capacitance of the capacitor in the tuning
circuit. This changes the resonant frequency, and this changes the radio station
that you will hear.
