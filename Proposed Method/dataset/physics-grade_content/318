19.2.2 Ohmic and non-ohmic conductors

As you have seen, there is a mention of constant temperature when we talk about Ohm's Law.

This is because the resistance of some conductors change as their temperature changes. These

types of conductors are called non-ohmic conductors, because they do not obey Ohm's Law.

As can be expected, the conductors that obey Ohm's Law are called ohmic conductors. A light

bulb is a common example of a non-ohmic conductor. Nichrome wire is an ohmic conductor.

In a light bulb, the resistance of the filament wire will increase dramatically as it warms from

room temperature to operating temperature. If we increase the supply voltage in a real lamp

circuit, the resulting increase in current causes the filament to increase in temperature, which

increases its resistance. This effectively limits the increase in current. In this case, voltage and

current do not obey Ohm's Law.

The phenomenon of resistance changing with variations in temperature is one shared by almost

all metals, of which most wires are made. For most applications, these changes in resistance

are small enough to be ignored. In the application of metal lamp filaments, which increase a lot

in temperature (up to about 1000◦C, and starting from room temperature) the change is quite

large.

In general non-ohmic conductors have plots of voltage against current that are curved,

indicating that the resistance is not constant over all values of voltage and current.
