31.3.2 Real-life applications

Solar Cells

The photo-electric effect may seem like a very easy way to produce electricity from the sun.

This is why people choose to make solar panels out of materials like silicon, to generate

electricity. In real-life however, the amount of electricity generated is less than expected. This

is because not every photon knocks out an electron. Other processes such as reflection or

scattering also happen. This means that only a fraction ≈ 10% (depends on the material) of

the photons produce photoelectrons. This drop in efficiency results in a lower measured current.

Much work is being done in industry to improve this efficiency so that the panels can generate

as high a current as possible, and create as much electricity as possible form the sun. But even

these smaller electrical currents are useful in applications like solar-powered calculators.

Exercise: The photoelectric effect

1. Describe the photoelectric effect.

2. List two reasons why the observation of the photoelectric effect was

significant.

3. Refer to Table 31.1: If I shine ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 288 nm

onto some aluminium foil, what would be the kinetic energy of the emitted

electrons?

4. I shine a light of an unknown wavelength onto some silver foil. The light has

only enough energy to eject electrons from the silver foil but not enough to

give them kinetic energy. (Refer to Table 31.1 when answering the questions

below:)

A If I shine the same light onto some copper foil, would electrons be

ejected?

B If I shine the same light onto some silicon, would electrons be ejected?

C If I increase the intensity of the light shining on the silver foil, what

happens?

D If I increase the frequency of the light shining on the silver foil, what

happens?

7,96× 10−19 J < 8,2× 10−19 J

Ephotons < φgold

The energy of each photon is less than the work function of gold. Therefore, the

photons do not have enough energy to knock electrons out of the gold. No

electrons would be emitted from the gold foil.

Extension: Units of energy

When dealing with calculations at a small scale (like at the level of electrons) it

is more convenient to use different units for energy rather than the Joule (J). We

define a unit called the electron-Volt (eV) as the kinetic energy gained by an

electron passing through a potential difference of one volt.

E = q × V

where q is the charge of the electron and V is the potential difference applied. The

charge of 1 electron is 1,6× 10−19 C, so 1 eV is calculated to be:

1 eV = (1,610−19 C× 1 V) = 1,6× 10−19 J

You can see that 1,6× 10−19 J is a very small amount of energy and so using

electron-Volts (eV) at this level is easier.

Hence, 1eV = 1.6× 10−19 J which means that 1 J = 6.241× 1018 eV
