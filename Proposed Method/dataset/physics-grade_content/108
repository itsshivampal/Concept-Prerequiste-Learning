7.5.5 Concave Mirrors

The first type of curved mirror we will study are concave mirrors. Concave mirrors have the shape

shown in Figure 7.17. As with a plane mirror, the principal axis is a line that is perpendicular to

the centre of the mirror.

If you think of light reflecting off a concave mirror, you will immediately see that things will look

very different compared to a plane mirror. The easiest way to understand what will happen is

to draw a ray diagram and work out where the images will form. Once we have done that it is

easy to see what properties the image has.

First we need to define a very important characteristic of the mirror. We have seen that the

centre of curvature is the centre of the sphere from which the mirror is cut. We then define that

a distance that is half-way between the centre of curvature and the mirror on the principal axis.
This point is known as the focal point and the distance from the focal point to the mirror is
known as the focal length (symbol f). Since the focal point is the midpoint of the line segment
joining the vertex and the center of curvature, the focal length would be one-half the radius of
curvature. This fact can come in very handy, remember if you know one then you know the
other!
Definition: Focal Point
The focal point of a mirror is the midpoint of a line segment joining the vertex and the
centre of curvature. It is the position at which all parallel rays are focussed.
Why are we making such a big deal about this point we call the focal point? It has an important
property we will use often. A ray parallel to the principal axis hitting the mirror will always be
reflected through the focal point. The focal point is the position at which all parallel rays are
focussed.

location of the image. Here the image is real and inverted.
From Figure 7.19, we see that the image created by a concave mirror is real and inverted, as
compared to the virtual and erect image created by a plane mirror.

Definition: Real Image

A real image can be cast on a screen; it is inverted, and on the same side of the mirror as

the object.

Extension: Convergence

A concave mirror is also known as a converging mirror. Light rays appear to converge

to the focal point of a concave mirror.
