10.1.2 Representing electric circuits

Components of electrical circuits

Some common elements (components) which can be found in electrical circuits include light

bulbs, batteries, connecting leads, switches, resistors, voltmeters and ammeters. You will learn

more about these items in later sections, but it is important to know what their symbols are and

how to represent them in circuit diagrams. Below is a table with the items and their symbols:

Circuit diagrams

Definition: Representing circuits

A physical circuit is the electric circuit you create with real components.

A circuit diagram is a drawing which uses symbols to represent the different components

in the physical circuit.

Component Symbol Usage

light bulb glows when charge moves through it

battery provides energy for charge to move

switch allows a circuit to be open or closed

resistor resists the flow of charge

voltmeter V measures potential difference

ammeter A measures current in a circuit

connecting lead connects circuit elements together

We use circuit diagrams to represent circuits because they are much simpler and more general

than drawing the physical circuit because they only show the workings of the electrical compo-

nents. You can see this in the two pictures below. The first picture shows the physical circuit

for an electric torch. You can see the light bulb, the batteries, the switch and the outside plastic

casing of the torch. The picture is actually a cross-section of the torch so that we can see inside

it.

Switch

Bulb

Batteries

Figure 10.1: Physical components of an electric torch. The dotted line shows the path of the

electrical circuit.

Below is the circuit diagram for the electric torch. Now the light bulb is represented by its

symbol, as are the batteries, the switch and the connecting wires. It is not necessary to show

the plastic casing of the torch since it has nothing to do with the electric workings of the torch.

You can see that the circuit diagram is much simpler than the physical circuit drawing!

Series and parallel circuits

There are two ways to connect electrical components in a circuit: in series or in parallel.

Definition: Series circuit

In a series circuit, the charge has a single path from the battery, returning to the battery.

Activity :: Discussion : Alternative Energy

At the moment, electric power is produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil.

In South Africa, our main source of electric power is coal burning power stations. (We

also have one nuclear power plant called Koeberg in the Western Cape). However,

burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of pollution into the earth's atmosphere

and can contribute to global warming. Also, the earth's fossil fuel reserves (especially

oil) are starting to run low. For these reasons, people all across the world are

working to find alternative/other sources of energy and on ways to conserve/save

energy. Other sources of energy include wind power, solar power (from the sun),

hydro-electric power (from water) among others.

With a partner, take out the lists you made earlier of the item/appliances/machines

which used electricity in the following environments. For each item, try to think of

an alternative AND a way to conserve or save power.

For example, if you had a flourescent light as an item used in the home, then:

• Alternative: use candles at supper time to reduce electricity consumption

• Conservation: turn off lights when not in a room, or during the day.

Topics:

• At home

• At school

• At the hospital

• In the city

Once you have finished making your lists, compare with the lists of other people in

your class.
