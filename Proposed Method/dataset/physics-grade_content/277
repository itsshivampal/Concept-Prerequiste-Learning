16.4 Resonance

Resonance is the tendency of a system to vibrate at a maximum amplitude at the natural

frequency of the system.

Resonance takes place when a system is made to vibrate at its natural frequency as a result of

vibrations that are received from another source of the same frequency. In the following

investigation you will measure the speed of sound using resonance.

Activity :: Experiment : Using resonance to measure the speed of sound

Aim:

To measure the speed of sound using resonance

Apparatus:

• one measuring cylinder

• a high frequency (512 Hz) tuning fork

• some water

• a ruler or tape measure

Method:

1. Make the tuning fork vibrate by hitting it on the sole of your shoe or

something else that has a rubbery texture. A hard surface is not ideal as you

can more easily damage the tuning fork.

2. Hold the vibrating tuning fork about 1 cm above the cylinder mouth and start

adding water to the cylinder at the same time. Keep doing this until the first

resonance occurs. Pour out or add a little water until you find the level at

which the loudest sound (i.e. the resonance) is made.

3. When the water is at the resonance level, use a ruler or tape measure to

measure the distance (LA) between the top of the cylinder and the water

level.

4. Repeat the steps ?? above, this time adding more water until you find the

next resonance. Remember to hold the tuning fork at the same height of

about 1 cm above the cylinder mouth and adjust the water level to get the

loudest sound.

5. Use a ruler or tape measure to find the new distance (LB) from the top of

the cylinder to the new water level.

Conclusions:

The difference between the two resonance water levels (i.e. L = LA − LB) is half

a wavelength, or the same as the distance between a compression and rarefaction.

Therefore, since you know the wavelength, and you know the frequency of the

tuning fork, it is easy to calculate the speed of sound!

Worked Example 109: Resonance

Question: A 512 Hz tuning fork can produce a resonance in a cavity where the air

column is 18,2 cm long. It can also produce a second resonance when the length of

the air column is 50,1 cm. What is the speed of sound in the cavity?

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what is given and what is asked:

L1 = 18,2 cm

L2 = 50,3 cm

f = 512 Hz

v = ?

Remember that:

v = f × λ

We have values for f and so to calculate v, we need to first find λ. You know that

the difference in the length of the air column between two resonances is half a

wavelength.

Step 2 : Calculate the difference in the length of the air column between

the two resonances:

L2 − L1 = 32,1 cm

Therefore 32,1 cm = 12 × λ

So,

λ = 2× 32,1 cm

= 64,2 cm

= 0,642 m

Step 3 : Now you can substitute into the equation for v to find the speed

of sound:

From the investigation you will notice that the column of air will make a sound at a certain

length. This is where resonance takes place.
