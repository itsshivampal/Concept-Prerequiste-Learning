1. In the diagram below the peaks of wavefronts are shown by black lines and the troughs

by grey lines. Mark all the points where constructive interference between two waves is

taking place and where destructive interference is taking place. Also note whether the

interference results in a peak or a trough.

Chapter 27

Wave Nature of Matter - Grade 12

27.1 Introduction

In chapters 30 and 31 the so called wave-particle duality if light is described. This duality

states that light displays properties of both waves and of particles, depending on the

experiment performed. For example, interference and diffraction of light are properties of its

wave nature, while the photoelectric effect is a property of its particle nature. In fact we call a

particle of light a photon.

Hopefully you have realised that nature loves symmetry. So, if light which was originally

believed to be a wave also has a particle nature then perhaps particles, also display a wave

nature. In other words matter which which we originally thought of as particles may also

display a wave-particle duality.

27.2 de Broglie Wavelength

Einstein showed that for a photon, its momentum, p, is equal to its energy, E divided the

speed of light, c:

E

p = .

c

The energy of the photon can also be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the light, λ:

hc

E = ,

λ

where h is Planck's constant. Combining these two equations we find that the the momentum

of the photon is related to its wavelength

hc h

p = = ,

cλ λ

or equivalently

h

λ = .

p

In 1923, Louis de Broglie proposed that this equation not only holds for photons, but also holds

for particles of matter. This is known as the de Broglie hypothesis

Definition: De Broglie Hypothesis

A particle of mass m moving with velocity v has a wavelength λ related to is momentum

p = mv by

h h

λ = = (27.1)

p mv

This wavelength, λ, is known as the de Broglie wavelength of the particle.
