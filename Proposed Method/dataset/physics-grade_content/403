25.3.5 Colours on a Television Screen

If you look very closely at a colour cathode-ray television screen or computer screen, you will

see that there are very many small red, green and blue dots called phosphors on it. These dots

are caused to fluoresce (glow brightly) when a beam of electrons from the cathode-ray tube

behind the screen hits them. Since different combinations of the three primary colours of light

can produce any other colour, only red, green and blue dots are needed to make pictures

containing all the colours of the visible spectrum.

Exercise: Colours of light

1. List the three primary colours of light.

2. What is the term for the phenomenon whereby white light is split up into its

different colours by a prism?

3. What is meant by the term "complementary colour" of light?

4. When white light strikes a prism which colour of light is refracted the most

and which is refracted the least? Explain your answer in terms of the speed of

light in a medium.

Itneterreessttinigng Color blindness in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some

FFacctt or all colors that other people can see. Most often it is a genetic problem, but

may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or due to exposure to

certain chemicals. The most common forms of human color blindness result

from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone

systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from

one another. This is called "red-green color blindness". Other forms of color

blindness are much rarer. They include problems in discriminating blues from

yellows, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or monochromasy,

where one cannot distinguish any color from grey, as in a black-and-white

movie or photograph.

Worked Example 162: Seeing Colours

Question: When blue and green light fall on an eye, is cyan light being created?

Discuss.

Answer

Cyan light is not created when blue and green light fall on the eye. The blue and

green receptors are stimulated to make the brain believe that cyan light is being

created.
