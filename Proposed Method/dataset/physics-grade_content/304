Itneterreessttinigng The discovery of the relationship between magnetism and electricity was, like

FFacctt so many other scientific discoveries, stumbled upon almost by accident. The

Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the

possibility of electricity and magnetism being related to one another, and in the

process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front of his whole class.

By passing an electric current through a metal wire suspended above a

magnetic compass, Oersted was able to produce a definite motion of the

compass needle in response to the current. What began as a guess at the start

of the class session was confirmed as fact at the end. Needless to say, Oersted

had to revise his lecture notes for future classes. His discovery paved the way

for a whole new branch of science - electromagnetism.

The magnetic field produced by an electric current is always oriented perpendicular to the

direction of the current flow. When we are drawing directions of magnetic fields and currents,

we use the symbol ⊙ and ⊗. The symbol

⊙

for an arrow that is coming out of the page and the symbol

⊗

for an arrow that is going into the page.

It is easy to remember the meanings of the symbols if you think of an arrow with a head and a

tail.

When the arrow is coming out of the page, you see the head of the arrow (⊙). When the arrow

is going into the page, you see the tail of the arrow (⊗).

The direction of the magnetic field around the current carrying conductor is shown in

Figure 18.1.

Activity :: Case Study : Direction of a magnetic field
Using the directions given in Figure 18.1 and Figure 18.2 and try to find a rule
that easily tells you the direction of the magnetic field.
Hint: Use your fingers. Hold the wire in your hands and try to find a link
between the direction of your thumb and the direction in which your fingers curl.
The magnetic field around a
current carrying conductor.
There is a simple method of showing the relationship between the direction of the current
flowing in a conductor and the direction of the magnetic field around the same conductor. The
method is called the Right Hand Rule. Simply stated, the right hand rule says that the
magnetic flux lines produced by a current-carrying wire will be oriented the same direction as
the curled fingers of a person's right hand (in the "hitchhiking" position), with the thumb
pointing in the direction of the current flow.

Apparatus:

2. 2 hookup wires with alligator clips
3. compass
4. stop watch
Method:
1. Connect your wires to the battery leaving one end unconnected so that the
circuit is not closed.
2. One student should be in charge of limiting the current flow to 10 seconds.
This is to preserve battery life as well as to prevent overheating of wires and
battery contacts.
3. Place the compass close to the wire.
4. Close the circuit and observe what happens to the compass.

happens to the compass.
Conclusions:
Use your observations to answer the following questions:
1. Does a current flowing in a wire generate a magnetic field?
2. Is the magnetic field present when the current is not flowing?
3. Does the direction of the magnetic field produced by a current in a wire
depend on the direction of the current flow?
4. How does the direction of the current affect the magnetic field?
Activity :: Case Study : Magnetic field around a loop of conductor
Consider two loops of current carrying conductor that are placed in the plane of
the page. Draw what you think the magnetic field would look like, by using the
Right Hand Rule at different points of the two loops shown. Loop 1 has the
current flowing in a counter-clockwise direction, while loop 2 has the current
flowing in a clockwise direction.

If you make a loop of current carrying conductor, then the direction of the magnetic field is
