23.2 Work

Definition: Work

When a force exerted on an object causes it to move, work is done on the object (except if

the force and displacement are at right angles to each other).

This means that in order for work to be done, an object must be moved a distance d by a force

F , such that there is some non-zero component of the force in the direction of the

displacement. Work is calculated as:

W = F ·∆x cos θ. (23.1)

where F is the applied force, ∆x is the displacement of the object and θ is the angle between

the applied force and the direction of motion.

F cos θ

It is very important to note that for work to be done there must be a component of the applied

force in the direction of motion. Forces perpendicular to the direction of motion do no work.

the object. The object is displaced by ∆y at right angles to the force. θ = 90◦ and cos θ = 0.

Work is not done in this situation.

for work to be done a force must be applied in the direction of motion and there

must be a displacement. Give reasons for your answer.

As with all physical quantities, work must have units. Following from the definition, work is
measured in N·m. The name given to this combination of S.I. units is the joule (symbol J).
Definition: Joule
1 joule is the work done when an object is moved 1 m under the application of a force of
1 N in the direction of motion.
The work done by an object can be positive or negative. Since force (F‖) and displacement (s)
are both vectors, the result of the above equation depends on their directions:
• If F‖ acts in the same direction as the motion then positive work is being done. In this
case the object on which the force is applied gains energy.
• If the direction of motion and F‖ are opposite, then negative work is being done. This
means that energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For example, if you try to push
a car uphill by applying a force up the slope and instead the car rolls down the hill you
are doing negative work on the car. Alternatively, the car is doing positive work on you!
Important: The everyday use of the word "work" differs from the physics use. In physics,
only the component of the applied force that is parallel to the motion does work on an
object. So, for example, a person holding up a heavy book does no work on the book.
Worked Example 149: Calculating Work Done I
Question: If you push a box 20 m forward by applying a force of 15 N in the
forward direction, what is the work you have done on the box?
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided
• The force applied is F=15 N.
• The distance moved is s=20 m.
• The applied force and distance moved are in the same direction. Therefore,
F‖=15 N.
These quantities are all in the correct units, so no unit conversions are required.
Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked
• We are asked to find the work done on the box. We know from the definition
that work done is W = F‖s
515
23.2 CHAPTER 23. WORK, ENERGY AND POWER - GRADE 12
Step 3 : Next we substitute the values and calculate the work done
W = F‖s
= (15 N)(20 m)
= 300 J
Remember that the answer must be positive as the applied force and the motion
are in the same direction (forwards). In this case, you (the pusher) lose energy,
while the box gains energy.
Worked Example 150: Calculating Work Done II
Question: What is the work done by you on a car, if you try to push the car up a
hill by applying a force of 40 N directed up the slope, but it slides downhill 30 cm?
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided
• The force applied is F=40 N
• The distance moved is s=30 cm. This is expressed in the wrong units so we
must convert to the proper S.I. units (meters):
100 cm = 1m
1
1 cm = m
100
∴ 30× 11 cm = 30× m
100
30
= m
100
= 0,3m
• The applied force and distance moved are in opposite directions. Therefore, if
we take s=0.3 m, then F‖=-40 N.
Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked
• We are asked to find the work done on the car by you. We know that work
done is W = F‖s
Step 3 : Substitute the values and calculate the work done
Again we have the applied force and the distance moved so we can proceed with
calculating the work done:
W = F‖s
= (−40N)(0.3m)
= −12J
Note that the answer must be negative as the applied force and the motion are in
opposite directions. In this case the car does work on the person trying to push.
What happens when the applied force and the motion are not parallel? If there is an angle
between the direction of motion and the applied force then to determine the work done we
have to calculate the component of the applied force parallel to the direction of motion. Note
that this means a force perpendicular to the direction of motion can do no work.

Worked Example 151: Calculating Work Done III
Question: Calculate the work done on a box, if it is pulled 5 m along the ground
by applying a force of F=10 N at an angle of 60◦ to the horizontal.
F
60◦
Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided
• The force applied is F=10 N
• The distance moved is s=5 m along the ground
• The angle between the applied force and the motion is 60◦
These quantities are in the correct units so we do not need to perform any unit
conversions.
Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked
• We are asked to find the work done on the box.
Step 3 : Calculate the component of the applied force in the direction of
motion
Since the force and the motion are not in the same direction, we must first
calculate the component of the force in the direction of the motion.
F
F‖
60◦
F||
From the force diagram we see that the component of the applied force parallel to
the ground is
F|| = F · cos(60◦)
= 10N · cos(60◦)
= 5N
Step 4 : Substitute and calculate the work done
Now we can calculate the work done on the box:
W = F‖s
= (5N)(5m)
= 25 J
Note that the answer is positive as the component of the force F‖ is in the same
direction as the motion.
