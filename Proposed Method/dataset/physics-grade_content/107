7.5.4 Spherical Mirrors

The second class of mirrors that we will look at are spherical mirrors. These mirrors are called

spherical mirrors because if you take a sphere and cut it as shown in Figure 7.16 and then polish

the inside of one and the outside of the other, you will get a concave mirror and convex mirror

as shown. These two mirrors will be studied in detail.

The centre of curvature is the point at the centre of the sphere and describes how big the sphere

is.
