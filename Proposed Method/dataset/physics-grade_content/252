14.3.3 Period and Frequency

Definition: Period

The period of a wave is the time taken by the wave to move one wavelength.

Definition: Frequency

The frequency of a wave is the number of wavelengths per second.

The period of a longitudinal wave is the time taken by the wave to move one wavelength. As

for transverse waves, the symbol T is used to represent period and period is measured in

seconds (s).

The frequency f of a wave is the number of wavelengths per second. Using this definition and

the fact that the period is the time taken for 1 wavelength, we can define:

14.3.2 Wavelength and Amplitude

Definition: Wavelength

The wavelength in a longitudinal wave is the distance between two consecutive points that

are in phase.

The wavelength in a longitudinal wave refers to the distance between two consecutive

compressions or between two consecutive rarefactions.

Definition: Amplitude

The amplitude is the maximum displacement from a position of rest.

The amplitude is the distance from the equilibrium position of the medium to a compression or

a rarefaction.
