30.6 Penetrating ability of electromagnetic radiation

Different kinds of electromagnetic radiation have different penetrabilities. For example, if we

take the human body as the object. Infrared light is emitted by the human body. Visible light

is reflected off the surface of the human body, ultra-violet light (from sunlight) damages the

skin, but X-rays are able to penetrate the skin and bone and allows for pictures of the inside of

the human body to be taken.

If we compare the energy of visible light to the energy of X-rays, we find that X-rays have a

much higher energy. Usually, kinds of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy have higher

penetrabilities than those with low energies.

Certain kinds of electromagnetic radiation such as ultra-violet radiation, X-rays and gamma

rays are very dangerous. Radiation such as these are called ionising radiation. Ionising radiation

loses energy as it passes through matter, breaking molecular bonds and creating ions.

Excessive exposure to radiation, including sunlight, X-rays and all nuclear radiations, can cause

destruction of biological tissue.
