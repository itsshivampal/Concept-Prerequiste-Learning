7.2 Light Rays

In physics we use the idea of a light ray to indicate the direction that light travels. Light rays

are lines with arrows and are used to show the path that light travels. In Figure 7.1, the light

rays from the object enters the eye and the eye sees the object.

The most important thing to remember is that we can only see an object when light from the

object enters our eyes. The object must be a source of light (for example a light bulb) or else it

must reflect light from a source (for example the moon), and the reflected light enters our eyes.

Important: We cannot see an object unless light from that object enters our eyes.

Definition: Light ray

Light rays are straight lines with arrows to show the path of light.

Important: Light rays are not real. They are merely used to show the path that light

travels.

Figure 7.1: We can only see an object when light from that object enters our eyes. We draw

light as lines with arrows to show the direction the light travels. When the light travels from the

object to the eye, the eye can see the object.

Activity :: Investigation : Light travels in straight lines

Apparatus:

You will need a candle, matches and three sheets of paper.

Method:

1. Make a small hole in the middle of each of the three sheets of paper.

2. Light the candle.

3. Look at the burning candle through the hole in the first sheet of paper.

4. Place the second sheet of paper between you and the candle so that you can

still see the candle through the holes.

5. Now do the same with the third sheet so that you can still see the candle. The

sheets of paper must not touch each other.

6. What do you notice about the holes in the paper?

Conclusions:

In the investigation you will notice that the holes in the paper need to be in a straight

line. This shows that light travels in a straight line. We cannot see around corners.

This also proves that light does not bend around a corner, but travels straight.

Activity :: Investigation : Light travels in straight lines

On a sunny day, stand outside and look at something in the distance, for example

a tree, a flower or a car. From what we have learnt, we can see the tree, flower or

car because light from the object is entering our eye. Now take a sheet of paper and

hold it about 20 cm in front of your face. Can you still see the tree, flower or car?

Why not?
