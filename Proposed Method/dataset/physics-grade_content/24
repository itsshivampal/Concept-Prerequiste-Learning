3.2.2 Position

Definition: Position

Position is a measurement of a location, with reference to an origin.

A position is a measurement of a location, with reference to an origin. Positions can therefore be

negative or positive. The symbol x is used to indicate position. x has units of length for example

cm, m or km. Figure 3.2.2 shows the position of a school. Depending on what reference point

we choose, we can say that the school is 300 m from Joan's house (with Joan's house as the

reference point or origin) or 500 m from Joel's house (with Joel's house as the reference point

or origin).

The shop is also 300 m from Joan's house, but in the opposite direction as the school. When

we choose a reference point, we have a positive direction and a negative direction. If we choose

the direction towards the school as positive, then the direction towards the shop is negative. A

negative direction is always opposite to the direction chosen as positive.

Activity :: Discussion : Reference Points

Divide into groups of 5 for this activity. On a straight line, choose a refer-

ence point. Since position can have both positive and negative values, discuss the

advantages and disadvantages of choosing

1. either end of the line,

2. the middle of the line.

This reference point can also be called "the origin".

Exercise: Position

1. Write down the positions for objects at A, B, D and E. Do not forget the units.

that positions to the right are positive.
