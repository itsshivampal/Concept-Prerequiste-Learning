18.3 Current induced by a changing magnetic field

While Oersted's surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical

applications of electricity, it was Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical

generation of electricity: electromagnetic induction.

Faraday discovered that a voltage was generated across a length of wire while moving a magnet

nearby, such that the distance between the two changed. This meant that the wire was

exposed to a magnetic field flux of changing intensity. Furthermore, the voltage also depended

on the orientation of the magnet; this is easily understood again in terms of the magnetic flux.

The flux will be at its maximum as the magnet is aligned perpendicular to the wire. The

magnitude of the changing flux and the voltage are linked. In fact, if the lines of flux are

parallel to the wire, there will be no induced voltage.

Definition: Faraday's Law

The emf, ǫ, produced around a loop of conductor is proportional to the rate of change of

the magnetic flux, φ, through the area, A, of the loop. This can be stated mathematically

as:

∆

ǫ = − φN

∆t

where φ = B ·A and B is the strength of the magnetic field.

Faraday's Law relates induced emf to the rate of change of flux, which is the product of the

magnetic field and the cross-sectional area the field lines pass through.

When the north pole of a magnet is pushed into a solenoid, the flux in the solenoid increases so

the induced current will have an associated magnetic field pointing out of the solenoid

(opposite to the magnet's field). When the north pole is pulled out, the flux decreases, so the

induced current will have an associated magnetic field pointing into the solenoid (same

direction as the magnet's field) to try to oppose the change. The directions of currents and

associated magnetic fields can all be found using only the Right Hand Rule. When the fingers

of the right hand are pointed in the direction of the current, the thumb points in the direction

of the magnetic field. When the thumb is pointed in the direction of the magnetic field, the

fingers point in the direction of the current.

Important: An easy way to create a magnetic field of changing intensity is to move a

permanent magnet next to a wire or coil of wire. The magnetic field must increase or

decrease in intensity perpendicular to the wire (so that the lines of flux "cut across" the

conductor), or else no voltage will be induced.

Important: Finding the direction of the induced current

The induced current generates a magnetic field. The induced magnetic field is in a direction

that cancels out the magnetic field in which the conductor is moving. So, you can use the

Right Hand Rule to find the direction of the induced current by remembering that the induced

magnetic field is opposite in direction to the magnetic field causing the change.

Electromganetic induction is put into practical use in the construction of electrical generators,

which use mechanical power to move a magnetic field past coils of wire to generate voltage.

However, this is by no means the only practical use for this principle.

If we recall that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire was always

perpendicular to that wire, and that the flux intensity of that magnetic field varied with the

amount of current through it, we can see that a wire is capable of inducing a voltage along its

own length simply due to a change in current through it. This effect is called self-induction.

Self-induction is when a changing magnetic field is produced by changes in current through a

wire inducing voltage along the length of that same wire.

If the magnetic field flux is enhanced by bending the wire into the shape of a coil, and/or

wrapping that coil around a material of high permeability, this effect of self-induced voltage will

be more intense. A device constructed to take advantage of this effect is called an inductor,

and will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.

Extension: Lenz's Law

The induced current will create a magnetic field that opposes the change in the

magnetic flux.
