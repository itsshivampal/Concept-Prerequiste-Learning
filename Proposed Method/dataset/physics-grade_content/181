11.7.2 Algebraic Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

Vectors in a Straight Line

Whenever you are faced with adding vectors acting in a straight line (i.e. some directed left and

some right, or some acting up and others down) you can use a very simple algebraic technique:

Method: Addition/Subtraction of Vectors in a Straight Line

1. Choose a positive direction. As an example, for situations involving displacements in the

directions west and east, you might choose west as your positive direction. In that case,

displacements east are negative.

2. Next simply add (or subtract) the vectors using the appropriate signs.

3. As a final step the direction of the resultant should be included in words (positive answers

are in the positive direction, while negative resultants are in the negative direction).

11.7 CHAPTER 11. VECTORS

Let us consider a few examples.

Worked Example 53: Adding vectors algebraically I

Question: A tennis ball is rolled towards a wall which is 10 m away from the wall.

If after striking the wall the ball rolls a further 2,5 m along the ground away from

the wall, calculate algebraically the ball's resultant displacement.

Answer

Step 1 : Draw a rough sketch of the situation

10 m

2,5 m

Wall

Start

Step 2 : Decide which method to use to calculate the resultant

We know that the resultant displacement of the ball (~xR) is equal to the sum of the

ball's separate displacements (~x1 and ~x2):

~xR = ~x1 + ~x2

Since the motion of the ball is in a straight line (i.e. the ball moves towards and

away from the wall), we can use the method of algebraic addition just explained.

Step 3 : Choose a positive direction

Let's make towards the wall the positive direction. This means that away from the

wall becomes the negative direction.

Step 4 : Now define our vectors algebraically

With right positive:

~x1 = +10,0m

~x2 = −2,5m

Step 5 : Add the vectors

Next we simply add the two displacements to give the resultant:

~xR = (+10m) + (−2,5m)

= (+7,5)m

Step 6 : Quote the resultant

Finally, in this case towards the wall means positive so: ~xR = 7,5 m towards the

wall.

Worked Example 54: Subtracting vectors algebraically I

Question: Suppose that a tennis ball is thrown horizontally towards a wall at an

initial velocity of 3 m·s−1to the right. After striking the wall, the ball returns to the

thrower at 2 m·s−1. Determine the change in velocity of the ball.

Step 1 : Draw a sketch

A quick sketch will help us understand the problem.

Question: A tennis ball is rolled towards a wall which is 10 m away from the wall.
If after striking the wall the ball rolls a further 2,5 m along the ground away from
the wall, calculate algebraically the ball's resultant displacement.

Since the motion of the ball is in a straight line (i.e. the ball moves towards and
away from the wall), we can use the method of algebraic addition just explained.

2 m·s−1
Wall
Start
Step 2 : Decide which method to use to calculate the resultant
Remember that velocity is a vector. The change in the velocity of the ball is equal
to the difference between the ball's initial and final velocities:
∆~v = ~vf − ~vi
Since the ball moves along a straight line (i.e. left and right), we can use the
algebraic technique of vector subtraction just discussed.
Step 3 : Choose a positive direction
Choose towards the wall as the positive direction. This means that away from the
wall becomes the negative direction.
Step 4 : Now define our vectors algebraically
~vi = +3m · s−1
~vf = −2m · s−1
Step 5 : Subtract the vectors
Thus, the change in velocity of the ball is:
∆~v = (−2m · s−1)− (+3m · s−1)
= (−5)m · s−1
Step 6 : Quote the resultant
Remember that in this case towards the wall means positive so: ∆~v = 5m · s−1 to
the away from the wall.

Determine his resultant displacement by using accurate scale drawings.
2. A dove flies from her nest, looking for food for her chick. She flies at a velocity
of 2 m·s−1on a bearing of 135◦ and then at a velocity of 1,2 m·s−1on a bearing
of 230◦. Calculate her resultant velocity by using accurate scale drawings.
3. A squash ball is dropped to the floor with an initial velocity of 2,5 m·s−1. I
rebounds (comes back up) with a velocity of 0,5 m·s−1.
3.1 What is the change in velocity of the squash ball?
3.2 What is the resultant velocity of the squash ball?
Remember that the technique of addition and subtraction just discussed can only be applied to
vectors acting along a straight line. When vectors are not in a straight line, i.e. at an angle to
each other, the following method can be used:

A More General Algebraic technique
Simple geometric and trigonometric techniques can be used to find resultant vectors.
Worked Example 55: An Algebraic Solution I
Question: A man walks 40 m East, then 30 m North. Calculate the man's resultant
displacement.
Answer
Step 1 : Draw a rough sketch
As before, the rough sketch looks as follows:
res
ult
an
t
30 m
N
W E
α
S
40 m
Step 2 : Determine the length of the resultant
Note that the triangle formed by his separate displacement vectors and his resultant
displacement vector is a right-angle triangle. We can thus use the Theorem of
Pythagoras to determine the length of the resultant. Let x represent the length of
the resultant vector. Then:
x2R = (40m)
2 + (30m)2
x2R = 2 500m
2
xR = 50m
Step 3 : Determine the direction of the resultant
Now we have the length of the resultant displacement vector but not yet its di-
rection. To determine its direction we calculate the angle α between the resultant
displacement vector and East, by using simple trigonometry:
oppositeside
tanα =
adjacentside
30
tanα =
40
α = tan−1(0,75)
α = 36,9◦
Step 4 : Quote the resultant
The resultant displacement is then 50 m at 36,9◦ North of East.
This is exactly the same answer we arrived at after drawing a scale diagram!
In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to calculate the resultant
displacement. This was possible since the directions of motion were perpendicular (north and
east). Algebraic techniques, however, are not limited to cases where the vectors to be combined
are along the same straight line or at right angles to one another. The following example
illustrates this.

Worked Example 56: An Algebraic Solution II
Question: A man walks from point A to point B which is 12 km away on a bearing
of 45◦. From point B the man walks a further 8 km east to point C. Calculate the
resultant displacement.
Answer
Step 1 : Draw a rough sketch of the situation

BAˆF = 45◦ since the man walks initially on a bearing of 45◦. Then, ABˆG =
BAˆF = 45◦ (parallel lines, alternate angles). Both of these angles are included in
the rough sketch.
Step 2 : Calculate the length of the resultant
The resultant is the vector AC. Since we know both the lengths of AB and BC and
the included angle ABˆC, we can use the cosine rule:
AC2 = AB2 +BC2 − 2 ·AB · BC cos(ABˆC)
= (12)2 + (8)2 − 2 · (12)(8) cos(135◦)
= 343,8
AC = 18,5 km
Step 3 : Determine the direction of the resultant
Next we use the sine rule to determine the angle θ:
sin θ sin 135◦
=
8 18,5
8× sin 135◦
sin θ =
18,5
θ = sin−1(0,3058)
θ = 17,8◦
To find FAˆC, we add 45◦. Thus, FAˆC = 62,8◦.
Step 4 : Quote the resultant
The resultant displacement is therefore 18,5 km on a bearing of 062,8◦.
