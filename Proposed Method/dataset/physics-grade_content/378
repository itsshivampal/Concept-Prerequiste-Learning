23.1 Introduction

Imagine a vendor carrying a basket of vegetables on her head. Is she doing any work? One

would definitely say yes! However, in Physics she is not doing any work! Again, imagine a boy

pushing against a wall? Is he doing any work? We can see that his muscles are contracting and

expanding. He may even be sweating. But in Physics, he is not doing any work!

If the vendor is carrying a very heavy load for a long distance, we would say she has lot of

energy. By this, we mean that she has a lot of stamina. If a car can travel very fast, we

describe the car as powerful. So, there is a link between power and speed. However, power

means something different in Physics. This chapter describes the links between work, energy

and power and what these mean in Physics.

You will learn that work and energy are closely related. You shall see that the energy of an

object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring energy from one

object or form to another. In other words,

• an object with lots of energy can do lots of work.

• when work is done, energy is lost by the object doing work and gained by the object on

which the work is done.

Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them. Even making electricity

flow requires that something do work. Something must have energy and transfer it through

doing work to make things happen.
