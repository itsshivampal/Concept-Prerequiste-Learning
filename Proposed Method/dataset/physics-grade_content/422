27.1 Introduction

In chapters 30 and 31 the so called wave-particle duality if light is described. This duality

states that light displays properties of both waves and of particles, depending on the

experiment performed. For example, interference and diffraction of light are properties of its

wave nature, while the photoelectric effect is a property of its particle nature. In fact we call a

particle of light a photon.

Hopefully you have realised that nature loves symmetry. So, if light which was originally

believed to be a wave also has a particle nature then perhaps particles, also display a wave

nature. In other words matter which which we originally thought of as particles may also

display a wave-particle duality.
