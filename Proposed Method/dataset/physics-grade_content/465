30.5 The particle nature of electromagnetic radiation

When we talk of electromagnetic radiation as a particle, we refer to photons, which are packets

of energy. The energy of the photon is related to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation

according to: h is called Planck's constant.

Definition: Planck's constant

Planck's constant is a physical constant named after Max Planck.

h = 6,626× 10−34 J · s

The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula: E = hf or E = h c . Where E is

λ

the energy of the photon in joules (J), h is planck's constant, c is the speed of light, f is the

frequency in hertz (Hz) and λ is the wavelength in metres (m).

Worked Example 187: Calculating the energy of a photon I

Question: Calculate the energy of a photon with a frequency of 3× 1018 Hz

Answer

We use the formula: E = hf

E = hf

= 6,6× 10−34 × 3× 1018

= 2× 10−15 J

Worked Example 188: Calculating the energy of a photon II

Question: What is the energy of an ultraviolet photon with a wavelength of

200 nm?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required and how to approach the problem.

We are required to calculate the energy associated with a photon of ultraviolet

light with a wavelength of 200 nm.

We can use:

E = h

λ

Examples of some uses of electromagnetic waves are shown in Table 30.2.

Table 30.2: Uses of EM waves

Category Uses

gamma rays used to kill the bacteria in marsh-

mallows

X-rays used to image bone structures

ultraviolet light bees can see into the ultraviolet

because flowers stand out more

clearly at this frequency

visible light used by humans to observe the

world

infrared night vision, heat sensors, laser

metal cutting

microwave microwave ovens, radar

radio waves radio, television broadcasts

In theory the spectrum is infinite, although realistically we can only observe wavelengths from a

few hundred kilometers to those of gamma rays due to experimental limitations.

Humans experience electromagnetic waves differently depending on their wavelength. Our eyes

are sensitive to visible light while our skin is sensitive to infrared, and many wavelengths we do

not detect at all.

Exercise: EM Radiation

1. Arrange the following types of EM radiation in order of increasing frequency:

infrared, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible, gamma.

2. Calculate the frequency of an EM wave with a wavelength of 400 nm.

3. Give an example of the use of each type of EM radiation, i.e. gamma rays,

X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared, microwave and radio and TV

waves.
