17.4.2 Real-world application: lightning

Lightning is an atmospheric discharge of electricity, usually, but not always, during a rain

storm. An understanding of lightning is important for power transmission lines as engineers

who need to know about lightning in order to adequately protect lines and equipment.

Extension: Formation of lightning

1. Charge separation

The first process in the generation of lightning is charge separation. The

mechanism by which charge separation happens is still the subject of research.

One theory is that opposite charges are driven apart and energy is stored in

the electric field between them. Cloud electrification appears to require strong

updrafts which carry water droplets upward, supercooling them to −10 to

−20 oC. These collide with ice crystals to form a soft ice-water mixture called

graupel. The collisions result in a slight positive charge being transferred to

ice crystals, and a slight negative charge to the graupel. Updrafts drive lighter

ice crystals upwards, causing the cloud top to accumulate increasing positive

charge. The heavier negatively charged graupel falls towards the middle and

lower portions of the cloud, building up an increasing negative charge. Charge

separation and accumulation continue until the electrical potential becomes

sufficient to initiate lightning discharges, which occurs when the gathering of

positive and negative charges forms a sufficiently strong electric field.

2. Leader formation

As a thundercloud moves over the Earth's surface, an equal but opposite

charge is induced in the Earth below, and the induced ground charge follows

the movement of the cloud. An initial bipolar discharge, or path of ionized

air, starts from a negatively charged mixed water and ice region in the

thundercloud. The discharge ionized channels are called leaders. The negative

charged leaders, called a "stepped leader", proceed generally downward in a

number of quick jumps, each up to 50 metres long. Along the way, the

stepped leader may branch into a number of paths as it continues to descend.

The progression of stepped leaders takes a comparatively long time (hundreds

of milliseconds) to approach the ground. This initial phase involves a

relatively small electric current (tens or hundreds of amperes), and the leader

is almost invisible compared to the subsequent lightning channel. When a

step leader approaches the ground, the presence of opposite charges on the

ground enhances the electric field. The electric field is highest on trees and

tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a conductive discharge

(called a positive streamer) can develop from these points. As the field

increases, the positive streamer may evolve into a hotter, higher current

leader which eventually connects to the descending stepped leader from the

cloud. It is also possible for many streamers to develop from many different

402

objects simultaneously, with only one connecting with the leader and forming

the main discharge path. Photographs have been taken on which

non-connected streamers are clearly visible. When the two leaders meet, the

electric current greatly increases. The region of high current propagates back

up the positive stepped leader into the cloud with a "return stroke" that is

the most luminous part of the lightning discharge.

3. Discharge When the electric field becomes strong enough, an electrical

discharge (the bolt of lightning) occurs within clouds or between clouds and

the ground. During the strike, successive portions of air become a conductive

discharge channel as the electrons and positive ions of air molecules are pulled

away from each other and forced to flow in opposite directions. The electrical

discharge rapidly superheats the discharge channel, causing the air to expand

rapidly and produce a shock wave heard as thunder. The rolling and gradually

dissipating rumble of thunder is caused by the time delay of sound coming

from different portions of a long stroke.

Important: Estimating distance of a lightning strike

The flash of a lightning strike and resulting thunder occur at roughly the same time. But light

travels at 300 000 kilometres in a second, almost a million times the speed of sound. Sound

travels at the slower speed of 330 m/s in the same time, so the flash of lightning is seen before

thunder is heard. By counting the seconds between the flash and the thunder and dividing by 3,

you can estimate your distance from the strike and initially the actual storm cell (in kilometres).
