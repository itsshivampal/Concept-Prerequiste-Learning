16.1 Introduction

What is your favorite musical instrument? How do you play it? Do you pluck a string, like a

guitar? Do you blow through it, like a flute? Do you hit it, like a drum? All of these work by

making standing waves. Each instrument has a unique sound because of the special waves

made in it. These waves could be in the strings of a guitar or violin. They could also be in the

skin of a drum or a tube of air in a trumpet. These waves are picked up by the air and later

reach your ear as sound.

In Grade 10, you learned about standing waves and boundary conditions. We saw a rope that

was:

• fixed at both ends

• fixed at one end and free at the other

We also saw a pipe:

• closed at both ends

• open at both ends

• open at one end, closed at the other

String and wind instruments are good examples of standing waves on strings and pipes.

One way to describe standing waves is to count nodes. Recall that a node is a point on a string

that does not move as the wave changes. The anti-nodes are the highest and lowest points on

the wave. There is a node at each end of a fixed string. There is also a node at the closed end

of a pipe. But an open end of a pipe has an anti-node.

What causes a standing wave? There are incident and reflected waves traveling back and forth

on our string or pipe. For some frequencies, these waves combine in just the right way so that

the whole wave appears to be standing still. These special cases are called harmonic

frequencies, or harmonics. They depend on the length and material of the medium.

Definition: Harmonic

A harmonic frequency is a frequency at which standing waves can be made.
