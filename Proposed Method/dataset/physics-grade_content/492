31.5.3 Laser applications and safety

Although the first working laser was only produced in 1958, lasers are now found in many

household items. For example, lasers are well-known through their use as cheap laser pointers.

However, lasers can be very dangerous to the human eye since a large amount of energy is

focused into a very narrow beam. NEVER POINT A LASER POINTER INTO

SOMEBODY'S EYES - it can blind them.

Other uses include:

• Semiconductor lasers which are small, efficient and cheap to make are found in CD

players.

• He-Ne Lasers are used in most grocery shops to read in the price of items using their

barcodes. This makes the cashiers' job much quicker and easier.

• High energy lasers are used in medicine as a cutting and welding tool. Eye surgery in

particular make use of the precision of lasers to reattach the retinas of patients' eyes.

The heat from cutting lasers also helps to stop the bleeding on a wound by burning the

edges (called cauterising).

Activity :: Case Study : Uses of lasers

Do research in a library or on the Internet on one application of laser

technology. Explain how the technology works by using a laser.

You will need to present your findings to the class in the form of a poster. You

can think of any useful application, but to give you some ideas of where to start,

some applications are listed below:

• laser printers

• laser communication and fibre optics

• optical storage

• using lasers as precision measurement tools

• your own ideas...

1. Explain what is meant by spontaneous emission of radiation.

2. Explain what is meant by stimulated emission of radiation.

3. List the similarities and differences between spontaneous emission of radiation

and stimulated emission of radiation.

4. How is the light emitted by a laser different from the light emitted by a light

bulb?

5. Describe using a simple diagram, how a laser works. Your description should

include the following concepts: metastable state and population inversion.

6. Give examples of some materials that have been used for lasers. What do all

these materials have in common?

7. Describe how the laser cavity affects:

• increasing amplification

• concentrating beam intensity

• narrowing the frequency of the beam

8. List some applications of lasers.

beam.

Sometimes a laser photon runs into another excited electron. Then stimulated emission occurs

and the electron drops down to the ground state and emits an additional identical photon as

shown in Figure 31.9. Since the laser material typically has a large number of atoms, one laser

photon passing through this material will rapidly cause a large number of photons just like it to

be emitted.

The optical cavity keeps the laser photons inside the laser cavity so they can build up the laser

beam. At each end is a concave mirror; one is a full mirror and one is a partial mirror. The full

mirror is totally reflective. The partial mirror transmits a small amount of the light that hits

it(less than 1%). The mirrors are carefully aligned so that photons that reflect off one mirror

become "trapped", and bounce back and forth between the mirrors many times causing more

and more stimulated emission. The photons that eventually escape through the

partially-silvered mirror become the laser beam that we see.

As the photons bounce between mirrors, they continually pass through the laser material,

stimulating those atoms to emit more photons. This creates an ever increasing beam of

photons, all with the same characteristics, all traveling in the same direction. In this way, the

optical cavity helps to amplify the original laser photons into a concentrated, intense beam of

photons.

The laser cavity also helps to narrow the frequency range of laser light emitted. The distance

between the two mirrors defines the cavity mode which only allows light of a narrow range of

frequencies to continue being reflected back and forth. Light of other frequencies damped out.

(This is just like in the chapter on the physics of music where a pipe of a certain length

corresponds to a particular wavelength of sound.) Therefore only a narrow frequency of light

can be emitted.

Itneterreessttinigng In 1953, Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and

FFacctt Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser, a device operating on similar

principles to the laser, but producing microwave rather than optical radiation.

Townes's maser was incapable of making a continuous beam. Nikolay Basov

and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the former Soviet Union worked independently and

developed a method of making a continuous beam using more than two energy

levels. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.
