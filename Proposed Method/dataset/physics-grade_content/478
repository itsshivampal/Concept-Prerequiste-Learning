31.2.1 Energy levels of an electron

We have seen that the electrons in an atom have different energy levels. When the electron

receives enough energy, it can jump up to a higher energy level. This is called 'exciting' the

electron. When the electron in a high energy level sheds some energy, it drops to a lower

energy level.

We have also seen that the energy associated with light at a specific wavelength is given by:

hc

E = .

λ

In the particle model of light, this means that each packet of light (photon) at a wavelength λ

has energy:

hc

E = .

λ

For the electron to receive energy, it absorbs a photon and gets its energy. When an electron

loses energy to drop to a lower level, it emits (gives off) a photon with that energy.

31.1 Introduction

For centuries physicists argued about whether light was a particle or a wave. It was assumed

that light could only be one or the other, but not both.

In earlier chapters on waves (Chapters 6, 24, 25, 26) and optics (Chapters 7 and 13), you

studied how light or other electromagnetic radiation propagates like a wave. The wave nature

of light of was demonstrated by the propagation of light in examples such as diffraction,

interference, and polarisation of light.

You also saw in Chapter 30 on electromagnetic radiation how light sometimes behaves as a

particle. This chapter looks at evidence supporting the particle model of light. The idea that

light can have both wave and particle properties was one of the most important discoveries of

the twentieth century.
