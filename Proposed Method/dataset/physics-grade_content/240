rays entering the telescope are again parallel when they reach your eye.

Long-sightedness

Long-sightedness or hyperopia is a defect of vision which means that the image is focused in

behind the retina. People with this condition can see distant objects clearly, but not close ones.

A converging lens in front of the eye corrects long-sightedness by converging the light rays slightly

before they enter the eye. Reading glasses are an example of a converging lens used to correct

long-sightedness.

Astigmatism

Astigmatism is characterised by a cornea or lens that is not spherical, but is more curved in one

plane compared to another. This means that horizontal lines may be focused at a different point

to vertical lines. Astigmatism is corrected by a special lens, which has different focal lengths in

the vertical and horizontal planes.

13.4 Gravitational Lenses

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts that light that passes close to very heavy objects

like galaxies, black holes and massive stars will be bent. These massive objects therefore act as

a kind of lens that is known as a gravitational lens. Gravitational lenses distort and change the

apparent position of the image of stars.

If a heavy object is acting as a gravitational lens, then an observer from Earth will see many

images of a distant star (Figure 13.19).

13.5 Telescopes

We have seen how a simple lens can be used to correct eyesight. Lenses and mirrors are also

combined to magnify (or make bigger) objects that are far away.

Telescopes use combinations of lenses to gather and focus light. However, telescopes collect light

from objects that are large but far away, like planets and galaxies. For this reason, telescopes

are the tools of astronomers. Astronomy is the study of objects outside the Earth, like stars,

planets, galaxies, comets, and asteroids.

Usually the object viewed with a telescope is very far away. There are two types of objects: those

with a detectable diameter, such as the moon, and objects that appear as points of light, like

stars.

There are many kinds of telescopes, but we will look at two basic types: reflecting and refracting.
