13.2 Lenses

In this section we will discuss properties of thin lenses. In Grade 10, you learnt about two kinds

of mirrors: concave mirrors which were also known as converging mirrors and convex mirrors

which were also known as diverging mirrors. Similarly, there are two types of lenses: converging

and diverging lenses.

We have learnt how light travels in different materials, and we are now ready to learn how we

can control the direction of light rays. We use lenses to control the direction of light. When

light enters a lens, the light rays bend or change direction as shown in Figure 13.1.

Definition: Lens

A lens is any transparent material (e.g. glass) of an appropriate shape that can take parallel

rays of incident light and either converge the rays to a point or diverge the rays from a

point.

Some lenses will focus light rays to a single point. These lenses are called converging or concave

lenses. Other lenses spread out the light rays so that it looks like they all come from the same

point. These lenses are called diverging or convex lenses. Lenses change the direction of light

rays by refraction. They are designed so that the image appears in a certain place or as a certain

size. Lenses are used in eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. You also have lenses

in your eyes!

Definition: Converging Lenses

Converging lenses converge parallel rays of light and are thicker in the middle than at the

edges.

Definition: Diverging Lenses

Diverging lenses diverge parallel rays of light and are thicker at the edges than in the middle.

light enter the lens at the same point

(a) A converging lens will focus the rays that enter the lens

parallel rays of rays are spread out

light enter the lens as if they are comingfrom the same point

(b) A diverging lens will spread out the rays that enter the lens

Examples of converging and diverging lenses are shown in Figure 13.2.

Figure 13.2: Types of lenses

Before we study lenses in detail, there are a few important terms that must be defined. Figure 13.3

shows important lens properties:

• The principal axis is the line which runs horizontally straight through the optical centre

of the lens. It is also sometimes called the optic axis.

• The optical centre (O) of a convex lens is usually the centre point of the lens. The

direction of all light rays which pass through the optical centre, remains unchanged.

• The focus or focal point of the lens is the position on the principal axis where all light

rays which run parallel to the principal axis through the lens converge (come together) at

a point. Since light can pass through the lens either from right to left or left to right,

there is a focal point on each side of the lens (F1 and F2), at the same distance from the

optical centre in each direction. (Note: the plural form of the word focus is foci.)

• The focal length (f) is the distance between the optical centre and the focal point.
