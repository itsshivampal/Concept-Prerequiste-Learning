31.4.1 Emission Spectra

You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom. The electrons surrounding the

atomic nucleus are arranged in a series of levels of increasing energy. Each element has its own

distinct set of energy levels. This arrangement of energy levels serves as the atom's unique

fingerprint.

In the early 1900s, scientists found that a liquid or solid heated to high temperatures would

give off a broad range of colours of light. However, a gas heated to similar temperatures would

emit light only at certain specific colours (wavelengths). The reason for this observation was

not understood at the time.

Scientists studied this effect using a discharge tube.

Figure 31.3: Diagram of a discharge tube. The tube is filled with a gas. When a high enough

voltage is applied to both ends of the tube, the gas ionises and acts like a conductor, allowing a

current to flow through the circuit. The current excites the atoms of the ionised gas. When the

atoms fall back to their ground state, they emit photons to carry off the excess energy.

A discharge tube (Figure 31.3) is a glass gas-filled tube with a metal plate at both ends. If a

large enough voltage difference is applied between the two metal plates, the gas atoms inside

the tube will absorb enough energy to make some of their electrons come off i.e. the gas atoms

are ionised. These electrons start moving through the gas and create a current, which raises

some electrons in other atoms to higher energy levels. Then as the electrons in the atoms fall

back down, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The amount of light emitted at different

wavelengths, called the emission spectrum, is shown for a discharge tube filled with hydrogen

gas in figure 31.4 below. Only certain wavelengths (i.e. colours) of light are seen as shown by

the thick black lines in the picture.

Figure 31.4: Diagram of the emission spectrum of hydrogen in the visible spectrum. Four lines

are visible, and are labeled with their wavelengths. The three lines in the 400-500 nm range are

in the blue part of the spectrum, while the higher line (656 nm) is in the red/orange part.

Eventually, scientists realized that these lines come from photons of a specific energy, emitted

by electrons making transitions between specific energy levels of the atom. Figure ?? shows an

example of this happening. When an electron in an atom falls from a higher energy level to a

lower energy level, it emits a photon to carry off the extra energy. This photon's energy is

equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels. As we previously discussed, the

frequency of a photon is related to its energy through the equation E = hf . Since a specific

photon frequency (or wavelength) gives us a specific colour, we can see how each coloured line

is associated with a specific transition.

Figure 31.5: In this diagram are shown some of the electron energy levels for the hydrogen atom.

The arrows show the electron transitions from higher energy levels to lower energy levels. The

energies of the emitted photons are the same as the energy difference between two energy levels.

You can think of absorption as the opposite process. The arrows would point upwards and the

electrons would jump up to higher levels when they absorp a photon of the right energy.

Visible light is not the only kind of electromagnetic radiation emitted. More energetic or less

energetic transitions can produce ultraviolet or infrared radiation. However, because each atom

has its own distinct set of energy levels (its fingerprint!), each atom has its own distinct

emission spectrum.

4. I shine a light of an unknown wavelength onto some silver foil. The light has

only enough energy to eject electrons from the silver foil but not enough to

give them kinetic energy. (Refer to Table 31.1 when answering the questions

below:)

A If I shine the same light onto some copper foil, would electrons be

ejected?

B If I shine the same light onto some silicon, would electrons be ejected?

C If I increase the intensity of the light shining on the silver foil, what

happens?
