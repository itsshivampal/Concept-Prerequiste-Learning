3.9 Equations of Motion

In this chapter we will look at the third way to describe motion. We have looked at describing

motion in terms of graphs and words. In this section we examine equations that can be used to

describe motion.

This section is about solving problems relating to uniformly accelerated motion. In other words,

motion at constant acceleration.

The following are the variables that will be used in this section:

vi = initial velocity (m·s−1) at t = 0 s

vf = final velocity (m·s−1) at time t

∆x = displacement (m)

t = time (s)

∆t = time interval (s)

a = acceleration (m·s−2)

vf = vi + at (3.1)

(vi + vf )

∆x = t (3.2)

The questions can vary a lot, but the following method for answering them will always work.

Use this when attempting a question that involves motion with constant acceleration. You need

any three known quantities (vi, vf , ∆x, t or a) to be able to calculate the fourth one.

1. Read the question carefully to identify the quantities that are given. Write them down.

2. Identify the equation to use. Write it down!!!

3. Ensure that all the values are in the correct unit and fill them in your equation.

4. Calculate the answer and fill in its unit.

Itneterreessttinigng Galileo Galilei of Pisa, Italy, was the first to determined the correct mathematical

FFacctt law for acceleration: the total distance covered, starting from rest, is proportional

to the square of the time. He also concluded that objects retain their velocity

unless a force - often friction - acts upon them, refuting the accepted Aristotelian

hypothesis that objects "naturally" slow down and stop unless a force acts upon

them. This principle was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (1st law).
