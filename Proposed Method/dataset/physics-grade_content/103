7.5 Mirrors

A mirror is a highly reflective surface. The most common mirrors are flat and are known as

plane mirrors. Household mirrors are plane mirrors. They are made of a flat piece of glass with

a thin layer of silver nitrate or aluminium on the back. However, other mirrors are curved and

are either convex mirrors or are concave mirrors. The reflecting properties of all three types

of mirrors will be discussed in this section.
