10.3.1 Flow of Charge

We have been talking about moving charge. We need to be able to deal with numbers, how

much charge is moving, how fast is it moving? The concept that gives us this information is

called current. Current allows us to quantify the movement of charge.

When we talk about current we talk about how much charge moves past a fixed point in circuit

in one second. Think of charges being pushed around the circuit by the battery, there are charges

in the wires but unless there is a battery they won't move. When one charge moves the charges

next to it also move. They keep their spacing. If you had a tube of marbles like in this picture.

marble marble

If you push one marble into the tube one must come out the other side. If you look at any point

in the tube and push one marble into the tube, one marble will move past the point you are

looking at. This is similar to charges in the wires of a circuit.

If a charge moves they all move and the same number move at every point in the circuit.
