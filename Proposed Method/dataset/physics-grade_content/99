7.4 Refraction

In the previous sections we studied light reflecting off various surfaces. What happens when light

passes through a medium? Like all waves, the speed of light is dependent on the medium in

which it is travelling. When light moves from one medium into another (for example, from air

to glass), the speed of light changes. The effect is that the light ray passing into a new medium

is refracted, or bent. Refraction is therefore the bending of light as it moves from one optical

medium to another.

Definition: Refraction

Refraction is the bending of light that occurs because light travels at different speeds in

different materials.

When light travels from one medium to another, it will be bent away from its original path.

When it travels from an optically dense medium like water or glass to a less dense medium like

air, it will be refracted away from the normal (Figure 7.9). Whereas, if it travels from a less

dense medium to a denser one, it will be refracted towards the normal (Figure 7.10).

Just as we defined an angle of reflection in the previous section, we can similarly define an angle

of refraction as the angle between the surface normal and the refracted ray. This is shown in

Figure 7.11.
