5.6.2 Reflection of a Pulse from a Free End

Activity :: Investigation : Reflection of a Pulse from a Free End

Tie a rope to a pole in such a way that the rope can move up and down the pole.

Create a pulse in the rope by flicking one end up and down. Observe what happens

to the pulse when it reaches the pole.

When the end of the medium is free, for example a rope tied loosely to a pole, a pulse reflects

from the free end, but the pulse is not inverted. This is shown in Figure 5.10. We draw the

free end as a ring around the pole. The ring will move up and down the pole, while the pulse is

reflected away from the pole.

Important: The fixed and free ends that were discussed in this section are examples of

boundary conditions. You will see more of boundary conditions as you progress in the

Physics syllabus.

CHAPTER 5. TRANSVERSE PULSES - GRADE 10 5.7

1. A rope is tied to a tree and a single pulse is generated. What happens to the

pulse as it reaches the tree? Draw a diagram to explain what happens.

2. A rope is tied to a ring that is loosely fitted around a pole. A single pulse is

sent along the rope. What will happen to the pulse as it reaches the pole?

Draw a diagram to explain your answer.

5.6 CHAPTER 5. TRANSVERSE PULSES - GRADE 10

Activity :: Investigation : Reflection of a Pulse from a Fixed End

Tie a rope to a wall or some other object that cannot move. Create a pulse in

the rope by flicking one end up and down. Observe what happens to the pulse when

it reaches the wall.

Figure 5.9: Reflection of a pulse from a fixed end.

When the end of the medium is fixed, for example a rope tied to a wall, a pulse reflects from

the fixed end, but the pulse is inverted (i.e. it is upside-down). This is shown in Figure 5.9.
