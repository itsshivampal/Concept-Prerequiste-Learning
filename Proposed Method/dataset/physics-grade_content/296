17.5.4 Electric field in a capacitor

The electric field strength between the plates of a capacitor can be calculated using the

formula:

E = V where E is the electric field in J.C−1, V is the potential difference in V and d is the

d

distance between the plates in m.

Worked Example 120: Electric field in a capacitor

Question: What is the strength of the electric field in a capacitor which has a

potential difference of 300V between its parallel plates that are 0,02m apart?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We need to determine the electric field between the plates of the capacitor.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We can use the formula:

E = Vd

Step 3 : Determine what is given.

We are given the potential difference and the distance between the plates.

Step 4 : Determine the electric field

plates. As mentioned before, dielectrics can be air, paper, mica, perspex or glass.

plates.
