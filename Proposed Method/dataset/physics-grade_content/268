15.5 Ultrasound

Ultrasound is sound with a frequency that is higher than 20 kHz. Some animals, such as dogs,

dolphins, and bats, have an upper limit that is greater than that of the human ear and can hear

ultrasound.

The most common use of ultrasound is to create images, and has industrial and medical

applications. The use of ultrasound to create images is based on the reflection and

transmission of a wave at a boundary. When an ultrasound wave travels inside an object that is

made up of different materials such as the human body, each time it encounters a boundary,

e.g. between bone and muscle, or muscle and fat, part of the wave is reflected and part of it is

transmitted. The reflected rays are detected and used to construct an image of the object.

Ultrasound in medicine can visualise muscle and soft tissue, making them useful for scanning

the organs, and is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is a safe, non-invasive method

of looking inside the human body.

Ultrasound sources may be used to generate local heating in biological tissue, with applications

in physical therapy and cancer treatment. Focussed ultrasound sources may be used to break

up kidney stones.

Ultrasonic cleaners, sometimes called supersonic cleaners, are used at frequencies from 20-40

kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical

instruments and industrial parts. These cleaners consist of containers with a fluid in which the

object to be cleaned is placed. Ultrasonic waves are then sent into the fluid. The main

mechanism for cleaning action in an ultrasonic cleaner is actually the energy released from the

collapse of millions of microscopic bubbles occurring in the liquid of the cleaner.

FFacctt away rodents and insects, but there is no scientific evidence that the devices

work; controlled tests have shown that rodents quickly learn that the speakers

are harmless.

Itneterreessttinigng In echo-sounding the reflections from ultrasound pulses that are bounced off

FFacctt objects (for example the bottom of the sea, fish etc.) are picked up. The

reflections are timed and since their speed is known, the distance to the object

can be found. This information can be built into a picture of the object that

reflects the ultrasound pulses.

CHAPTER 15. SOUND - GRADE 11 15.5

Notice that there are sounds which exceed the threshold of pain. Exposure to these sounds can

cause immediate damage to hearing. In fact, exposure to sounds from 80 dB and above can

damage hearing over time. Measures can be taken to avoid damage, such as wearing earplugs

or ear muffs. Limiting exposure time and increasing distance between you and the source are

also important steps to protecting your hearing.

Activity :: Discussion : Importance of Safety Equipment

Working in groups of 5, discuss the importance of safety equipment such as ear

protectors for workers in loud environments, e.g. those who use jack hammers or

direct aeroplanes to their parking bays. Write up your conclusions in a one page

report. Some prior research into the importance of safety equipment might be

necessary to complete this group discussion.
