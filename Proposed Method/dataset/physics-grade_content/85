6.4.4 Nodes and anti-nodes

A node is a point on a wave where no displacement takes place. In a standing wave, a node

is a place where the two waves cancel out completely as two waves destructively interfere in

the same place. A fixed end of a rope is a node. An anti-node is a point on a wave where

maximum displacement takes place. In a standing wave, an anti-node is a place where the two

waves constructively interfere. A free end of a rope is an anti-node.

Definition: Node

A node is a point on a wave where no displacement takes place. In a standing wave, a node

is a place where the two waves cancel out completely as two waves destructively interfere

in the same place. A fixed end of a rope is a node.

Definition: Anti-Node

An anti-node is a point on a wave where maximum displacement takes place. In a standing

wave, an anti-node is a place where the two waves constructively interfere. A free end of a

rope is an anti-node.

Important: The distance between two anti-nodes is only 12λ because it is the distance

from a peak to a trough in one of the waves forming the standing wave. It is the same as

the distance between two adjacent nodes. This will be important when we work out the

allowed wavelengths in tubes later. We can take this further because half-way between any

two anti-nodes is a node. Then the distance from the node to the anti-node is half the

distance between two anti-nodes. This is half of half a wavelength which is one quarter of

a wavelength, 14λ.
