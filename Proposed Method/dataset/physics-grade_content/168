11.3.1 Mathematical Representation

There are many ways of writing the symbol for a vector. Vectors are denoted by symbols with an

arrow pointing to the right above it. For example, ~a, ~v and F~ represent the vectors acceleration,

velocity and force, meaning they have both a magnitude and a direction.

Sometimes just the magnitude of a vector is needed. In this case, the arrow is omitted. In other

words, F denotes the magnitude of vector F~ . |F~ | is another way of representing the magnitude

of a vector.
