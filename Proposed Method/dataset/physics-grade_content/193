12.2.4 Force Diagrams

If we look at the example above and draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the

two-trailer-unit, the diagram would look like this:

FN : Upward force of road on trailers

Ff : Frictional force F1: Force of car on trailers (to the right)

on trailers (to the left)

Fg: Downward force of Earth on trailers

It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw force diagrams:

• Make your drawing large and clear.

• You must use arrows and the direction of the arrow will show the direction of the force.

• The length of the arrow will indicate the size of the force, in other words, the longer arrows

in the diagram (F1 for example) indicates a bigger force than a shorter arrow (Ff ). Arrows

of the same length indicate forces of equal size (FN and Fg). Use ?little lines? like in

maths to show this.

• Draw neat lines using a ruler. The arrows must touch the system or object.

• All arrows must have labels. Use letters with a key on the side if you do not have enough

space on your drawing.

• The labels must indicate what is applying the force (the force of the car?) on what the

force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which direction (to the right)

• If the values of the forces are known, these values can be added to the diagram or key.

• The force of A pulling B

• The force of B pulling A

• The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction

of motion)

We can also draw a box around trailer A or B, in which case the forces will be different.

B A

If we consider trailer A as a system, the following external forces will apply:

• The force of the car pulling on A (towards the right)

• The force of B pulling on A (towards the left)

• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity)

• The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer
