5.4.2 Motion of the Pulse

The motion of the pulse is much simpler than the motion of a particle in the medium.

Important: A point on a transverse pulse, eg. the peak, only moves in the direction of the

motion of the pulse.

Figure 5.5: Position of the peak of a pulse at different times (since we know the shape of the

pulse does not change we can look at only one point on the pulse to keep track of its position,

the peak for example). The pulse moves to the right as shown by the arrow.

Given the series of snapshots of a transverse pulse moving through a medium, de-

picted in Figure 5.5, do the following:

• draw up a table of time, position and velocity,

• plot a position vs. time graph,

• plot a velocity vs. time graph.

Answer

Step 1 : Interpreting the figure

Figure 5.5 shows the motion of a pulse through a medium and a dot to indicate the

same position on the pulse. If we follow the dot, we can draw a graph of position

vs time for a pulse. At t = 0 s the dot is at 0cm. At t = 1 s the dot is 1 cm away

from its original postion. At t = 2 s the dot is 2 cm away from its original postion,

and so on.

Step 2 : We can draw the following table:

time (s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

position (cm)

velocity (cm.s−1)

Step 3 : A graph of position vs time is drawn as is shown in the figure.
