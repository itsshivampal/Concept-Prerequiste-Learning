5.1 Introduction

This chapter forms the basis of the discussion into mechanical waves. Waves are all around us,

even though most of us are not aware of it. The most common waves are waves in the sea, but

waves can be created in any container of water, ranging from an ocean to a tea-cup. Simply, a

wave is moving energy.
