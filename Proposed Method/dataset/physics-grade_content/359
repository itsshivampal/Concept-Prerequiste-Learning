21.5.4 Relative Velocity

The velocity of an object is frame dependent. More specifically, the perceived velocity of an

object depends on the velocity of the observer. For example, a person standing on shore would

observe the velocity of a boat to be different than a passenger on the boat.

Worked Example 144: Relative Velocity

Question: The speedometer of a motor boat reads 5 m·s−1. The boat is moving

East across a river which has a current traveling 3 m·s−1 North. What would the

velocity of the motor boat be according to an observer on the shore?

Answer

Step 1 : First, draw a diagram showing the velocities involved.

S

The observer on the shore sees the boat moving with a velocity of 5,8 m·s−1 at

N59,04◦E due to the current pushing the boat perpendicular to its velocity. This is

contrary to the perspective of a passenger on the boat who perceives the velocity

of the boat to be 5 m·s−1 due East. Both perspectives are correct as long as the

frame of the observer is considered.

Worked Example 145: Relative Velocity 2

Question: It takes a man 10 seconds to ride down an escalator. It takes

the same man 15 s to walk back up the escalator against its motion.

How long will it take the man to walk down the escalator at the same

rate he was walking before?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required and what is given

We are required to determine the time taken for a man to walk down an

escalator, with its motion.

We are given the time taken for the man to ride down the escalator and

the time taken for the man to walk up the escalator, against it motion.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

Select down as positive and assume that the escalator moves at a

velocity ve. If the distance of the escalator is xe then:

xe

ve = (21.9)

10 s

Now, assume that the man walks at a velocity vm. Then we have that:

ve − xevm = (21.10)

15 s

We are required to find t in:

xe

ve + vm = (21.11)
