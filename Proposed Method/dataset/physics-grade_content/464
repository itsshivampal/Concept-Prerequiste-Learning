30.4 Electromagnetic spectrum

Observe the things around you, your friend sitting next to you, a large tree across the field.

How is it that you are able to see these things? What is it that is leaving your friend's arm and

entering your eye so that you can see his arm? It is light. The light originally comes from the

sun, or possibly a light bulb or burning fire. In physics, light is given the more technical term

electromagnetic radiation, which includes all forms of light, not just the form which you can see

with your eyes.

Electromagnetic radiation allows us to observe the world around us. It is this radiation which

reflects off of the objects around you and into your eye. The radiation your eye is sensitive to is

only a small fraction of the total radiation emitted in the physical universe. All of the different

fractions taped together make up the electromagnetic spectrum.

Figure 30.1: The electromagnetic spectrum as a function of frequency. The different types

according to wavelength are shown as well as everyday comparisons.

When white light is split into its component colours by a prism, you are looking

at a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The wavelength of a particular electromagnetic radiation will depend on how it was created.

Exercise: Wave Nature of EM Radiation

1. List one source of electromagnetic waves. Hint: consider the spectrum

diagram and look at the names we give to different wavelengths.

2. Explain how an EM wave propagates, with the aid of a diagram.

3. What is the speed of light? What symbol is used to refer to the speed of

light? Does the speed of light change?

4. Do EM waves need a medium to travel through?

The radiation can take on any wavelength, which means that the spectrum is continuous.

Physicists broke down this continuous band into sections. Each section is defined by how the

radiation is created, not the radiations wavelength. But each category is continuous within the

min and max wavelength of that category, meaning there are no wavelengths excluded within

some range.

The spectrum is in order of wavelength, with the shortest wavelength at one end and the

longest wavelength at the other. The spectrum is then broken down into categories as detailed

in Table 30.1.

Since an electromagnetic wave is still a wave, the following equation that you learnt in Grade

10 still applies:

c = f · λ

Question: Calculate the frequency of red light with a wavelength of 4,2× 10−7 m
Answer
We use the formula: c = fλ to calculate frequency. The speed of light is a
constant 3× 108m/s.
c = fλ
3× 108 = f × 4,2× 10−7
f = 7,14× 1014Hz
Worked Example 186: EM spectrum II
Question: Ultraviolet radiation has a wavelength of 200 nm. What is the
frequency of the radiation?
Answer
Step 1 : To calculate the frequency we need to identify the wavelength and
the velocity of the radiation.
Recall that all radiation travels at the speed of light (c) in vacuum. Since the
question does not specify through what type of material the Ultraviolet radiation is
traveling, one can assume that it is traveling through a vacuum. We can identify
two properties of the radiation - wavelength (200 nm) and speed (c). From
previous chapters, we know that the period of the wave is the time it takes for a
wave to complete one cycle or one wavelength.
Step 2 : Since we know the wavelength and we know the speed, lets first
calculate the Period (T).

Examples of some uses of electromagnetic waves are shown in Table 30.2.

Table 30.2: Uses of EM waves

Category Uses

gamma rays used to kill the bacteria in marsh-

mallows

X-rays used to image bone structures

ultraviolet light bees can see into the ultraviolet

because flowers stand out more

clearly at this frequency

visible light used by humans to observe the

world

infrared night vision, heat sensors, laser

metal cutting

microwave microwave ovens, radar

radio waves radio, television broadcasts

In theory the spectrum is infinite, although realistically we can only observe wavelengths from a

few hundred kilometers to those of gamma rays due to experimental limitations.

Humans experience electromagnetic waves differently depending on their wavelength. Our eyes

are sensitive to visible light while our skin is sensitive to infrared, and many wavelengths we do

not detect at all.

infrared, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible, gamma.

2. Calculate the frequency of an EM wave with a wavelength of 400 nm.

3. Give an example of the use of each type of EM radiation, i.e. gamma rays,

X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared, microwave and radio and TV

waves.
