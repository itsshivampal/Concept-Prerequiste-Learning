12.5.2 Exercise

1. 1.1 The fastest recorded delivery for a cricket ball is 161,3 km·hr−1, bowled by Shoaib

Akhtar of Pakistan during a match against England in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,

held in South Africa. Calculate the ball's momentum if it has a mass of 160 g.

1.2 The fastest tennis service by a man is 246,2 km·hr−1by Andy Roddick of the United

States of America during a match in London in 2004. Calculate the ball's momentum

if it has a mass of 58 g.

1.3 The fastest server in the women's game is Venus Williams of the United States of

America, who recorded a serve of 205 km·hr−1during a match in Switzerland in 1998.

Calculate the ball's momentum if it has a mass of 58 g.

1.4 If you had a choice of facing Shoaib, Andy or Venus and didn't want to get hurt, who

would you choose based on the momentum of each ball.

2. Two golf balls roll towards each other. They each have a mass of 100 g. Ball 1 is moving

at v1 = 2,4 m·s−1to the right, while ball 2 is moving at v2 = 3 m·s−1to the left. Calculate

the total momentum of the system.

3. Two motor cycles are involved in a head on collision. Motorcycle A has a mass of 200 kg

and was travelling at 120 km·hr−1south. Motor cycle B has a mass of 250 kg and was

travelling north at 100 km·hr−1. A and B is about to collide. Calculate the momentum of

the system before the collision takes place.
