12.3.5 Exercise

1. A fly hits the front windscreen of a moving car. Compared to the magnitude of the force

the fly exerts on the windscreen, the magnitude of the force the windscreen exerts on the

fly during the collision, is ...

A zero.

B smaller, but not zero.

C bigger.

D the same.

2. A log of wood is attached to a cart by means of a light, inelastic rope. A horse pulls the

cart along a rough, horizontal road with an applied force F. The total system accelerates

initally with an acceleration of magnitude a (figure 1). The forces acting on the cart during

the acceleration, are indicated in Figure 2.

Method:

1. Divide into groups of at least five.

2. Attach one end of the fishing line to the blackboard with tape. Have one

teammate hold the other end of the fishing line so that it is taut and roughly

horizontal. The line must be held steady and must not be moved up or down

during the experiment.

3. Have one teammate blow up a balloon and hold it shut with his or her fingers.

Have another teammate tape the straw along the side of the balloon. Thread

the fishing line through the straw and hold the balloon at the far end of the

line.

4. Let go of the rocket and observe how the rocket moves forward.

5. Optionally, the rockets of each group can be timed to determine a winner of

the fastest rocket.

5.1 Assign one teammate to time the event. The balloon should be let go

when the time keeper yells "Go!" Observe how your rocket moves toward

the blackboard.

5.2 Have another teammate stand right next to the blackboard and yell "Stop!"

when the rocket hits its target. If the balloon does not make it all the way

to the blackboard, "Stop!" should be called when the balloon stops moving.

The timekeeper should record the flight time.

5.3 Measure the exact distance the rocket traveled. Calculate the average

speed at which the balloon traveled. To do this, divide the distance traveled

by the time the balloon was "in flight." Fill in your results for Trial 1 in

the Table below.

5.4 Each team should conduct two more races and complete the sections in

the Table for Trials 2 and 3. Then calculate the average speed for the

three trials to determine your team's race entry time.

Results:

Distance (m) Time (s) Speed (m·s−1)

Trial 1

Trial 2

Trial 3

Average:

Conclusions:

The winner of this race is the team with the fastest average balloon speed.

While doing the experiment, you should think about,

1. What made your rocket move?

2. How is Newton's Third Law of Motion demonstrated by this activity?

3. Draw pictures using labeled arrows to show the forces acting on the inside of

the balloon before it was released and after it was released.
