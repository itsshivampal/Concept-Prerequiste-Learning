20.4.6 Real-World Applications of Semiconductors

Semiconductors form the basis of modern electronics. Every electrical appliance usually has

some semiconductor-based technology inside it. The fundamental uses of semiconductors are in

microchips (also known as integrated circuits) and microprocessors.

Integrated circuits are miniaturised circuits. The use of integrated circuits makes it possible for

electronic devices (like a cellular telephone or a hi-fi) to get smaller.

Microprocessors are a special type of integrated circuit. (NOTE TO SELF: more is needed but

I'm not that knowledgable and I'm tired of Googling...)

Activity :: Research Project : Semiconductors

Assess the impact on society of the invention of transistors, with particular

reference to their use in microchips (integrated circuits) and microprocessors.

CHAPTER 20. ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER - GRADE 11 20.5

Exercise: The p-n junction

1. Compare p- and n-type semi-conductors.

2. Explain how a p-n junction works using a diagram.

3. Give everyday examples of the application.

P N

The electric field from the external potential different can easily overcome the small internal

field (in the so-called depletion region, created by the initial drifting of charges): usually

anything bigger than 0.6V would be enough. The external field then attracts more e- to flow

from n-region to p-region and more holes from p-region to n-region and you have a forward

biased situation. the diode is ON.

20.4.5 Reverse biased

N P

in this case the external field pushes e- back to the n-region while more holes into the p-region,

as a result you get no current flow. Only the small number of thermally released minority

carriers (holes in the n-type region and e- in the p-type region) will be able to cross the

junction and form a very small current, but for all practical purposes, this can be ignored

of course if the reverse biased potential is large enough you get avalanche break down and

current flow in the opposite direction. In many cases, except for Zener diodes, you most likely

will destroy the diode.
