8.3.2 Magnetic attraction and repulsion

Like poles of magnets repel one another whilst unlike poles attract. This means that two N poles

or two S poles will push away from each other while a N pole and a S pole will be drawn towards

each other.

Definition: Attraction and Repulsion

Like poles of magnets repel each other whilst unlike poles attract each other.

Worked Example 39: Attraction and Repulsion

Question: Do you think the following magnets will repel or be attracted to each

other?

S magnet N N magnet S

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to determine whether the two magnets will repel each other or be

attracted to each other.

Step 2 : Determine what is given

We are given two magnets with the N pole of one approaching the N pole of the

other.

Step 3 : Determine the conclusion

Since both poles are the same, the magnets will repel each other.

Worked Example 40: Attraction and repulsion

Question: Do you think the following magnets will repel or be attracted to each

other?

N magnet S N magnet S

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to determine whether the two magnets will repel each other or be

attracted to each other.

Step 2 : Determine what is given

We are given two magnets with the N pole of one approaching the S pole of the

other.

Step 3 : Determine the conclusion

Since both poles are the different, the magnets will be attracted to each other.

3.2 If there is a difference, what is the reason for it?

3.3 Is the paper clip which was rubbed by the magnet now magnetised?

3.4 What is the difference between the two paper clips at the level of

their atoms and electrons?

4. Now, find a metal knitting needle, or a plastic ruler, or other plastic object.

Rub the bar magnet along the knitting needle a few times in the same direction.

Now put the knitting needle close to the paper clips and observe what happens.

4.1 Does the knitting needle attract the paper clips?

4.2 What does this tell you about the material of the knitting needle?

Is it ferromagnetic?

5. Repeat this experiment with objects made from other materials.

5.1 Which materials appear to be ferromagnetic and which are not? Put

your answers in a table.

8.3 Permanent magnets

8.3.1 The poles of permanent magnets

Because the domains in a permanent magnet all line up in a particular direction, the magnet

has a pair of opposite poles, called north (usually shortened to N) and south (usually shortened

to S). Even if the magnet is cut into tiny pieces, each piece will still have both a N and a S

pole. These poles always occur in pairs. In nature we never find a north magnetic pole or south

magnetic pole on its own.

S N

... after breaking in half ...

S S N S N

Magnetic fields are different to gravitational and electric fields. In nature, positive and negative

electric charges can be found on their own, but you never find just a north magnetic pole or

south magnetic pole on its own. On the very small scale, zooming in to the size of atoms,

magnetic fields are caused by moving charges (i.e. the negatively charged electrons).
