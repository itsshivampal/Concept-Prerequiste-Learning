2.2.1 SI Units

We will be using the SI units in this course. SI units are the internationally agreed upon units.

Historically these units are based on the metric system which was developed in France at the

time of the French Revolution.

Definition: SI Units

The name SI units comes from the French Syste`me International d'Unite´s, which means

international system of units.

There are seven base SI units. These are listed in Table 2.1. All physical quantities have units

which can be built from these seven base units. These seven units were defined to be the base

units. So, it is possible to create a different set of units by defining a different set of base units.

These seven units are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations

of the other six. This is identical to bricks and concrete being the base units of a building. You

can build different things using different combinations of bricks and concrete. The 26 letters of

the alphabet are the base units for a language like English. Many different words can be formed

by using these letters.

2.1 Introduction

Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy fabric. The shop assistant would need

to know how much fabric you needed. Telling her you need fabric 2 wide and 6 long would be

insufficient - you have to specify the unit (i.e. 2 metres wide and 6 metres long). Without

the unit the information is incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were

making curtains for a doll's house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide and 6 centimetres

long!

It is not just lengths that have units, all physical quantities have units (e.g. time, temperature,

distance, etc.).

Definition: Physical Quantity

A physical quantity is anything that you can measure. For example, length, temperature,

distance and time are physical quantities.
