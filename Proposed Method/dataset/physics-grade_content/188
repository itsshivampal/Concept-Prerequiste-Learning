12.1 Introduction

In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion. In this chapter we will learn

that a net force is needed to cause motion. We recall what a force is and learn about how force

and motion are related. We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse, and

we learn more about turning forces and the force of gravity.
