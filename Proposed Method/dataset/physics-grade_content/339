20.4.2 The p-n Junction

When p-type and n-type semiconductors are placed in contact with each other, a p-n junction

is formed. Near the junction, electrons and holes combine to create a depletion region.

Figure 20.4: The p-n junction forms between p- and n-type semiconductors. The free electrons

from the n-type material combine with the holes in the p-type material near the junction. There

is a small potential difference across the junction. The area near the junction is called the

depletion region because there are few holes and few free electrons in this region.

Electric current flows more easily across a p-n junction in one direction than in the other. If the

positive pole of a battery is connected to the p-side of the junction, and the negative pole to

the n-side, charge flows across the junction. If the battery is connected in the opposite

direction, very little charge can flow.

This might not sound very useful at first but the p-n junction forms the basis for computer

chips, solar cells, and other electronic devices.
