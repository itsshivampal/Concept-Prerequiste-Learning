30.2 Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation

If you watch a colony of ants walking up the wall, they look like a thin continuous black line.

But as you look closer, you see that the line is made up of thousands of separated black ants.

Light and all other types of electromagnetic radiation seems like a continuous wave at first, but

when one performs experiments on the light, one can notice that the light can have both wave

and particle like properties. Just like the individual ants, the light can also be made up of

individual bundles of energy, or quanta of light.

Light has both wave-like and particle-like properties (wave-particle duality), but only shows one

or the other, depending on the kind of experiment we perform. A wave-type experiment shows

the wave nature, and a particle-type experiment shows particle nature. One cannot test the

wave and the particle nature at the same time. A particle of light is called a photon.

Definition: Photon

A photon is a quantum (energy packet) of light.

The particle nature of light can be demonstrated by the interaction of photons with matter.

One way in which light interacts with matter is via the photoelectric effect, which will be

studied in detail in Chapter 31.

Electromagnetic Radiation

30.1 Introduction

This chapter will focus on the electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a

self-propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components

oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation, and are in phase

with each other. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of

the wave: these types include, in order of increasing frequency, radio waves, microwaves,

infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.
