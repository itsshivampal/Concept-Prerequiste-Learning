5.3.1 Pulse Length and Amplitude

The amplitude of a pulse is a measurement of how far the medium is displaced from a position

of rest. The pulse length is a measurement of how long the pulse is. Both these quantities are

shown in Figure 5.1.

Definition: Amplitude

The amplitude of a pulse is a measurement of how far the medium is displaced from rest.

CHAPTER 5. TRANSVERSE PULSES - GRADE 10 5.3

What do you notice about the values of a and p?

In the activity, we found that the values for how high the pulse (a) is and how wide the pulse

(p) is the same at different times. Pulse length and amplitude are two important quantities of

a pulse.

5.3 CHAPTER 5. TRANSVERSE PULSES - GRADE 10

In the activity, we created a pulse. A pulse is a single disturbance that moves through a

medium. A transverse pulse moves perpendicular to the medium. Figure 5.1 shows an example

of a transverse pulse. In the activity, the rope or spring was held horizontally and the pulse

moved the rope up and down. This was an example of a transverse pulse.
