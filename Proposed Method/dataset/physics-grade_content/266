15.4 Physics of the Ear and Hearing

Figure 15.2: Diagram of the human ear.

The human ear is divided into three main sections: the outer, middle, and inner ear. Let's

follow the journey of a sound wave from the pinna to the auditory nerve which transmits a

signal to the brain. The pinna is the part of the ear we typically think of when we refer to the

ear. Its main function is to collect and focus an incident sound wave. The wave then travels

through the ear canal until it meets the eardrum. The pressure fluctuations of the sound wave

make the eardrum vibrate. The three very small bones of the middle ear, the malleus

(hammer), the incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup), transmit the signal through to the

elliptical window. The elliptical window is the beginning of the inner ear. From the elliptical

window the sound waves are transmitted through the liquid in the inner ear and interpreted as

sounds by the brain. The inner ear, made of the semicircular canals, the cochlea, and the

auditory nerve, is filled with fluid. The fluid allows the body to detect quick movements and

maintain balance. The snail-shaped cochlea is covered in nerve cells. There are more than 25

000 hairlike nerve cells. Different nerve cells vibrate with different frequencies. When a nerve

cell vibrates, it releases electrical impulses to the auditory nerve. The impulses are sent to the

brain through the auditory nerve and understood as sound.

15.3 Speed of Sound

The speed of sound depends on the medium the sound is travelling in. Sound travels faster in

solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because the density of solids is

higher than that of liquids which means that the particles are closer together. Sound can be

transmitted more easily.

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. The hotter the medium

is, the faster its particles move and therefore the quicker the sound will travel through the

medium. When we heat a substance, the particles in that substance have more kinetic energy

and vibrate or move faster. Sound can therefore be transmitted more easily and quickly in

hotter substances.

Sound waves are pressure waves. The speed of sound will therefore be influenced by the

pressure of the medium through which it is travelling. At sea level the air pressure is higher

than high up on a mountain. Sound will travel faster at sea level where the air pressure is

higher than it would at places high above sea level.

Definition: Speed of sound

The speed of sound in air, at sea level, at a temperature of 21◦C and under normal atmo-

spheric conditions, is 344 m·s−1.
