25.2 Colour and Light

Our eyes are sensitive to visible light over a range of wavelengths from 390 nm to 780 nm (1

nm = 1× 10−9 m). The different colours of light we see are related to specific frequencies

(and wavelengths) of visible light. The wavelengths and frequencies are listed in table 25.1.

Colour Wavelength range (nm) Frequency range (Hz)

violet 390 - 455 769 - 659 ×1012

blue 455 - 492 659 - 610 ×1012

green 492 - 577 610 - 520 ×1012

yellow 577 - 597 520 - 503 ×1012

orange 597 - 622 503 - 482 ×1012

red 622 - 780 482 - 385 ×1012

Table 25.1: Colours, wavelengths and frequencies of light in the visible spectrum.

You can see from table 25.1 that violet light has the shortest wavelengths and highest

frequencies while red light has the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies.

25.2 CHAPTER 25. COLOUR - GRADE 12

Worked Example 159: Calculating the frequency of light given the

wavelength

Question: A streetlight emits light with a wavelength of 520 nm.

1. What colour is the light? (Use table 25.1 to determine the colour)

2. What is the frequency of the light?

Answer

Step 1 : What is being asked and what information are we given?

We need to determine the colour and frequency of light with a wavelength of

λ = 520 nm = 520× 10−9 m.

Step 2 : Compare the wavelength of the light to those given in table 25.1

We see from table 25.1 that light with wavelengths between 492 - 577 nm is green.

520 nm falls into this range, therefore the colour of the light is green.

Step 3 : Next we need to calculate the frequency of the light

We know that

c = f × λ

We know c and we are given that λ = 520× 10−9 m. So we can substitute in these

values and solve for the frequency f . (NOTE: Don't forget to always change units

into S.I. units! 1 nm = 1× 10−9 m.)

Worked Example 160: Calculating the wavelength of light given the

frequency

Question: A streetlight also emits light with a frequency of 490×1012 Hz.

1. What colour is the light? (Use table 25.1 to determine the colour)

2. What is the wavelength of the light?

Answer

Step 1 : What is being asked and what information are we given?

We need to find the colour and wavelength of light which has a frequency of

490×1012 Hz and which is emitted by the streetlight.

Step 2 : Compare the wavelength of the light to those given in table 25.1

We can see from table 25.1 that orange light has frequencies between 503 -

482×1012 Hz. The light from the streetlight has f = 490× 1012 Hz which fits into

this range. Therefore the light must be orange in colour.

Step 3 : Next we need to calculate the wavelength of the light

We know that

c = f × λ

We know c = 3× 108 m.s−1 and we are given that f = 490× 1012 Hz. So we can
