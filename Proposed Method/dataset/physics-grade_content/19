Motion in One Dimension - Grade

10

3.1 Introduction

This chapter is about how things move in a straight line or more scientifically how things move in

one dimension. This is useful for learning how to describe the movement of cars along a straight

road or of trains along straight railway tracks. If you want to understand how any object moves,

for example a car on the freeway, a soccer ball being kicked towards the goal or your dog chasing

the neighbour's cat, then you have to understand three basic ideas about what it means when

something is moving. These three ideas describe different parts of exactly how an object moves.

They are:

1. position or displacement which tells us exactly where the object is,

2. speed or velocity which tells us exactly how fast the object's position is changing or more

familiarly, how fast the object is moving, and

3. acceleration which tells us exactly how fast the object's velocity is changing.

You will also learn how to use position, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration to describe

the motion of simple objects. You will learn how to read and draw graphs that summarise the

motion of a moving object. You will also learn about the equations that can be used to describe

motion and how to apply these equations to objects moving in one dimension.

3.2 Reference Point, Frame of Reference and Position

The most important idea when studying motion, is you have to know where you are. The

word position describes your location (where you are). However, saying that you are here is

meaningless, and you have to specify your position relative to a known reference point. For

example, if you are 2 m from the doorway, inside your classroom then your reference point is

the doorway. This defines your position inside the classroom. Notice that you need a reference

point (the doorway) and a direction (inside) to define your location.

3.2.1 Frames of Reference

Definition: Frame of Reference

A frame of reference is a reference point combined with a set of directions.

A frame of reference is similar to the idea of a reference point. A frame of reference is defined

as a reference point combined with a set of directions. For example, a boy is standing still inside
