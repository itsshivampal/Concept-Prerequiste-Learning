11.8.1 Vector addition using components

Components can also be used to find the resultant of vectors. This technique can be applied

to both graphical and algebraic methods of finding the resultant. The method is simple: make

a rough sketch of the problem, find the horizontal and vertical components of each vector, find

the sum of all horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components and then use

them to find the resultant.

Consider the two vectors, A~ and B~ , in Figure 11.3, together with their resultant, R~ .

~R

A~

Figure 11.3: An example of two vectors being added to give a resultant

Each vector in Figure 11.3 can be broken down into a component in the x-direction and one

in the y-direction. These components are two vectors which when added give you the original

vector as the resultant. This is shown in Figure 11.4 where we can see that:

A~ = A~x +A~y

But, R~ ~x = A ~x +

B~ = B~ ~

Bx

x +By

and R~ ~y = Ay +B~y

R~ = R~x +R~y

In summary, addition of the x components of the two original vectors gives the x component of

the resultant. The same applies to the y components. So if we just added all the components

together we would get the same answer! This is another important property of vectors.

The first thing we must realise is that the order that we add the vectors does not

matter. Therefore, we can work through the vectors to be added in any order.

Step 2 : Resolve A~ into components

We find the components of A~ by using known trigonometric ratios. First we find the

magnitude of the vertical component, Ay:

sin θ =

sin 21,8◦ =

Step 4 : Determine the components of the resultant vector
Now we have all the components. If we add all the horizontal components then we
will have the x-component of the resultant vector, R~x. Similarly, we add all the
vertical components then we will have the y-component of the resultant vector, R~y.
Rx = Ax +Bx
= 5m+ 3m
= 8m
Therefore, R~x is 8 m to the right.
Ry = Ay +By
= 2m+ 4m
= 6m
Therefore, R~y is 6 m up.
Step 5 : Determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector
Now that we have the components of the resultant, we can use the Theorem of
Pythagoras to determine the magnitude of the resultant, R.
R2 = (Rx)
2 + (Ry)

R2 = (6)2 + (8)2
R2 = 100
∴ R = 10m

The magnitude of the resultant, R is 10 m. So all we have to do is calculate its
direction. We can specify the direction as the angle the vectors makes with a known
direction. To do this you only need to visualise the vector as starting at the origin
of a coordinate system. We have drawn this explicitly below and the angle we will
calculate is labeled α.

CHAPTER 11. VECTORS 11.8

The dot product is most similar to regular multiplication between scalars. To

take the dot product of two vectors, you just multiply their magnitudes to get out a

scalar answer. The maths definition of the dot product is:

~a •~b = |~a| · |~b| cos θ

Take two vectors ~a and ~b:

b

a

You can draw in the component of ~b that is parallel to ~a:

b

a θ

b cos θ

In this way we can arrive at the definition of the dot product. You find how much

of ~b is lined up with ~a by finding the component of ~b parallel to ~a. Then multiply

the magnitude of that component, |~b| cos θ, with the magnitude of ~a to get a scalar.

The second type of multiplication is more subtle and uses the directions of the

vectors in a more complicated way to get another vector as the answer. The maths

definition of the cross product is:

~a×~b = |~a||~b| sin θ

This gives the magnitude of the answer, but we still need to find the direction of

the resultant vector. We do this by applying the right hand rule.

Method: Right Hand Rule

1. Using your right hand: a

2. Point your index finger in the direction of ~a. θ

3. Point the middle finger in the direction of ~b.

4. Your thumb will show the direction of ~a×~b.
