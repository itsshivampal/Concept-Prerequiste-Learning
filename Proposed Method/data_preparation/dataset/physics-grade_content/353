21.4.1 Elastic Collisions

Definition: Elastic Collisions

An elastic collision is a collision where total momentum and total kinetic energy are both

conserved.

This means that in an elastic collision the total momentum and the total kinetic energy before

the collision is the same as after the collision. For these kinds of collisions, the kinetic energy is

not changed into another type of energy.

Before the Collision

Figure 21.5 shows two balls rolling toward each other, about to collide:

Before the balls collide, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual

momenta added together. Ball 1 has a momentum which we call pi1 and ball 2 has a

momentum which we call pi2, it means the total momentum before the collision is:

pi = pi1 + pi2

We calculate the total kinetic energy of the system in the same way. Ball 1 has a kinetic energy

which we call KEi1 and the ball 2 has a kinetic energy which we call KEi2, it means that the

total kinetic energy before the collision is:

KEi = KEi1 +KEi2

After the Collision

Figure 21.6 shows two balls after they have collided:

Figure 21.6: Two balls after they collide.

After the balls collide and bounce off each other, they have new momenta and new kinetic

energies. Like before, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta

added together. Ball 1 now has a momentum which we call pf1 and ball 2 now has a

momentum which we call pf2, it means the total momentum after the collision is

pf = pf1 + pf2

Ball 1 now has a kinetic energy which we call KEf1 and ball 2 now has a kinetic energy which

we call KEf2, it means that the total kinetic energy after the collision is:

KEf = KEf1 +KEf2

Since this is an elastic collision, the total momentum before the collision equals the total

momentum after the collision and the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total

kinetic energy after the collision. Therefore:

Initial Final

pi = pf (21.5)

pi1 + pi2 = pf1 + pf2

and

KEi = KEf (21.6)

KEi1 +KEi2 = KEf1 +KEf2

Worked Example 139: An Elastic Collision

Question: Consider a collision between two pool balls. Ball 1 is at rest and ball 2

is moving towards it with a speed of 2 m·s−1. The mass of each ball is 0.3 kg.

After the balls collide elastically, ball 2 comes to an immediate stop and ball 1

moves off. What is the final velocity of ball 1?

We calculate the total kinetic energy of the system in the same way. Ball 1 has a kinetic energy
which we call KEi1 and the ball 2 has a kinetic energy which we call KEi2, it means that the
total kinetic energy before the collision is:
KEi = KEi1 +KEi2

Figure 21.6: Two balls after they collide.
After the balls collide and bounce off each other, they have new momenta and new kinetic
energies. Like before, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta
added together. Ball 1 now has a momentum which we call pf1 and ball 2 now has a
momentum which we call pf2, it means the total momentum after the collision is
pf = pf1 + pf2
Ball 1 now has a kinetic energy which we call KEf1 and ball 2 now has a kinetic energy which
we call KEf2, it means that the total kinetic energy after the collision is:
KEf = KEf1 +KEf2
Since this is an elastic collision, the total momentum before the collision equals the total
momentum after the collision and the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total
kinetic energy after the collision. Therefore:
Initial Final
pi = pf (21.5)
pi1 + pi2 = pf1 + pf2
and
KEi = KEf (21.6)
KEi1 +KEi2 = KEf1 +KEf2

Answer
Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem
We are given:
• mass of ball 1, m1 = 0.3 kg
• mass of ball 2, m2 = 0.3 kg
• initial velocity of ball 1, vi1 = 0 m·s−1
• initial velocity of ball 2, vi2 = 2 m·s−1
• final velocity of ball 2, vf2 = 0 m·s−1
• the collision is elastic
All quantities are in SI units. We are required to determine the final velocity of ball
1, vf1. Since the collision is elastic, we know that
• momentum is conserved, m1vi1 +m2vi2 = m1vf1 + m2vf2
• energy is conserved, 12 (m1v2i1 +m2v2i2 = m1v2f1 +m2v2f2)
Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference
Choose to the right as positive.

Step 4 : Solve the problem
Momentum is conserved. Therefore:
pi = pf
m1vi1 +m2vi2 = m1vf1 +m2vf2
(0,3)(0) + (0,3)(2) = (0,3)vf1 + 0
vf1 = 2m · s−1
Step 5 : Quote the final answer
The final velocity of ball 1 is 2 m·s−1in the same direction as ball 2.
Worked Example 140: Another Elastic Collision
Question: Consider two 2 marbles. Marble 1 has mass 50 g and marble 2 has
mass 100 g. Edward rolls marble 2 along the ground towards marble 1 in the
positive x-direction. Marble 1 is initially at rest and marble 2 has a velocity of 3
m·s−1 in the positive x-direction. After they collide elastically, both marbles are
moving. What is the final velocity of each marble?
Answer
Step 1 : Decide how to approach the problem
We are given:
• mass of marble 1, m1=50 g
• mass of marble 2, m2=100 g
• initial velocity of marble 1, vi1=0 m·s−1
• initial velocity of marble 2, vi2=3 m·s−1
• the collision is elastic

CHAPTER 21. MOTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS - GRADE 12 21.4
The masses need to be converted to SI units.
m1 = 0,05 kg
m2 = 0,1 kg
We are required to determine the final velocities:
• final velocity of marble 1, vf1
• final velocity of marble 2, vf2
Since the collision is elastic, we know that
• momentum is conserved, pi = pf .
• energy is conserved, KEi=KEf .
We have two equations and two unknowns (v1, v2) so it is a simple case of solving
a set of simultaneous equations.
Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference
Choose to the right as positive.
Step 3 : Draw a rough sketch of the situation

m2 = 100g m1 = 50g m2 = 100g m1 = 50g
vi2 = 3m · s−1 vi1 = 0
Step 4 : Solve problem
Momentum is conserved. Therefore:
pi = pf
pi1 + pi2 = pf1 + pf2
m1vi1 +m2vi2 = m1vf1 +m2vf2
(0,05)(0) + (0,1)(3) = (0,05)vf1 + (0,1)vf2
0,3 = 0,05vf1 + 0,1vf2 (21.7)
Energy is also conserved. Therefore:

But according to the question, ball 1 is moving after the collision, therefore ball 1
moves to the right at 4 m·s−1and ball 2 moves to the left with a velocity of 1
m·s−1.
Worked Example 141: Colliding Billiard Balls

collision. Ball 1 was travelling at a speed of 2m · s−1 and ball 2 at a speed of
1,5m · s−1. After the collision, ball 1 travels away from ball 2 at a velocity of
1,5m · s−1.

Worked Example 141: Colliding Billiard Balls

Question: Two billiard balls each with a mass of 150g collide head-on in an elastic

collision. Ball 1 was travelling at a speed of 2m · s−1 and ball 2 at a speed of

1,5m · s−1. After the collision, ball 1 travels away from ball 2 at a velocity of

1,5m · s−1.

1. Calculate the velocity of ball 2 after the collision.

2. Prove that the collision was elastic. Show calculations.

Step 2 : Decide how to approach the problem

Since momentum is conserved in all kinds of collisions, we can use

conservation of momentum to solve for the velocity of ball 2 after the collision.

Step 3 : Solve problem

pbefore = pafter

( ) (m1vi1)+m2vi2 = m( 1vf1 +)m2vf2 ( )

0,3− 0,225 = −0,225 + 0,15vf2

vf2 = 3m · s−1

So after the collision, ball 2 moves with a velocity of 3m · s−1.

2. The fact that characterises an elastic collision is that the total kinetic energy

of the particles before the collision is the same as the total kinetic energy of

the particles after the collision. This means that if we can show that the

initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy, we have shown that

the collision is elastic.
