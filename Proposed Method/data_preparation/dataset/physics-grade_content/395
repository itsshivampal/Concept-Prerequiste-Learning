25.1 Introduction

We call the light that we humans can see 'visible light'. Visible light is actually just a small

part of the large spectrum of electromagnetic radiation which you will learn more about in

Chapter 30. We can think of electromagnetic radiation and visible light as transverse waves.

We know that transverse waves can be described by their amplitude, frequency (or wavelength)

and velocity. The velocity of a wave is given by the product of its frequency and wavelength:

v = f × λ (25.1)

However, electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is special because, no matter what

the frequency, it all moves at a constant velocity (in vacuum) which is known as the speed of

light. The speed of light has the symbol c and is:

c = 3× 108 m.s−1

Since the speed of light is c, we can then say:

c = f × λ (25.2)
