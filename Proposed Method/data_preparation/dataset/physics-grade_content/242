13.5.3 Southern African Large Telescope

The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is the largest single optical telescope in the

southern hemisphere, with a hexagonal mirror array 11 metres across. SALT is located in

Sutherland in the Northern Cape. SALT is able to record distant stars, galaxies and quasars a

billion times too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. This is equivalent to a person being

able to see a candle flame at on the moon.

SALT was completed in 2005 and is a truly international initiative, because the money to build

it came from South Africa, the United States, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and New

Zealand.

Activity :: SALT : Investigate what the South African Astronomical

Observatory (SAAO) does. SALT is part of SAAO. Write your investigation

as a short 5-page report.

rays entering the telescope are again parallel when they reach your eye.

13.5.2 Reflecting Telescopes

Some telescopes use mirrors as well as lenses and are called reflecting telescopes. Specifically,

a reflecting telescope uses a convex lens and two mirrors to make an object appear larger.

(Figure 13.21.)

Light is collected by the primary mirror, which is large and concave. Parallel rays traveling toward

this mirror are reflected and focused to a point. The secondary plane mirror is placed within the

focal length of the primary mirror. This changes the direction of the light. A final eyepiece lens

diverges the rays so that they are parallel when they reach your eye.
