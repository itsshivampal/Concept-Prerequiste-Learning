17.3.4 Parallel plates

One very important example of electric fields which is used extensively is the electric field

between two charged parallel plates. In this situation the electric field is constant. This is used

for many practical purposes and later we will explain how Millikan used it to measure the

charge on the electron.

This means that the force that a test charge would feel at any point between the plates would

be identical in magnitude and direction. The fields on the edges exhibit fringe effects, i.e. they

bulge outwards. This is because a test charge placed here would feel the effects of charges only

on one side (either left or right depending on which side it is placed). Test charges placed in

the middle experience the effects of charges on both sides so they balance the components in

the horizontal direction. This is clearly not the case on the edges.

Strength of an electric field

When we started making field maps we drew arrows to indicate the strength of the field and

the direction. When we moved to lines you might have asked "Did we forget about the field

strength?". We did not. Consider the case for a single positive charge again:

+Q

Notice that as you move further away from the charge the field lines become more spread out.

In field map diagrams the closer field lines are together the stronger the field. Therefore, the

electric field is stronger closer to the charge (the electric field lines are closer together) and

weaker further from the charge (the electric field lines are further apart).

The magnitude of the electric field at a point as the force per unit charge. Therefore,

F

E =

q

E and F are vectors. From this we see that the force on a charge q is simply:

F = E · q

The force between two electric charges is given by:

Qq

F = k .

r2

(if we make the one charge Q and the other q.) Therefore, the electric field can be written as:

Q

E = k

r2

The electric field is the force per unit of charge and hence has units of newtons per coulomb.

As with Coulomb's law calculations, do not substitute the sign of the charge into the equation

for electric field. Instead, choose a positive direction, and then either add or subtract the

contribution to the electric field due to each charge depending upon whether it points in the

positive or negative direction, respectively.
