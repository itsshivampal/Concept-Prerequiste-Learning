29.1 Introduction

Electronics and electrical devices surround us in daily life. From the street lights and water

pumps to computers and digital phones, electronics have enabled the digital revolution to

occur. All electronics are built on a backbone of simple circuits, and so an understanding of

circuits is vital in understanding more complex devices.

This chapter will explain the basic physics principles of many of the components of electronic

devices. We will begin with an explanation of capacitors and inductors. We see how these are

used in tuning a radio. Next, we look at active components such as transistors and operational

amplifiers. Lastly, the chapter will finish with an explanation of digital electronics, including

logic gates and counting circuits.

Before studying this chapter, you will want to remind yourself of:

• The meaning of voltage (V ), current (I) and resistance (R), as covered in Grade 10 (see

chapter 10), and Grade 11 (see chapter 19).

• Capacitors in electric circuits, as covered in Grade 11 (see section 17.6).

• Semiconductors, as covered in Grade 11 (see chapter 20).

• The meaning of an alternating current (see section 28.3).

• Capacitance (C) and Inductance (L) (see section 28.4).
