14.3.1 Compression and Rarefaction

As seen in Figure 14.2, there are regions where the medium is compressed and other regions

where the medium is spread out in a longitudinal wave.

The region where the medium is compressed is known as a compression and the region where

the medium is spread out is known as a rarefaction.

1. Take a spring and hang it from the ceiling. Pull the free end of the spring and

release it. Observe what happens.

2. In which direction does the disturbance move?

3. What happens when the disturbance reaches the ceiling?

4. Tie a ribbon to the middle of the spring. Watch carefully what happens to the

ribbon when the free end of the spring is pulled and released. Describe the

motion of the ribbon.

From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves in the same direction

as the direction in which the spring was pulled. The spring was pulled up and down and the

wave also moved up and down. The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the

medium. The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave. The ribbon

moves from rest upwards, then back to its original position, then down and then back to its

original position.

14.3 Characteristics of Longitudinal Waves

As for transverse waves the following can be defined for longitudinal waves: wavelength,

amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed. However instead of peaks and troughs,

longitudinal waves have compressions and rarefactions.

Definition: Compression

A compression is a region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are closer together.

Definition: Rarefaction

A rarefaction is a region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are further apart.

14.3.1 Compression and Rarefaction

As seen in Figure 14.2, there are regions where the medium is compressed and other regions

where the medium is spread out in a longitudinal wave.

The region where the medium is compressed is known as a compression and the region where

the medium is spread out is known as a rarefaction.
