2.8.1 Two other useful conversions

Very often in Science you need to convert speed and temperature. The following two rules will

help you do this:

Converting speed

When converting km·h−1 to m·s−1you divide by 3,6. For example 72 km·h−1 ÷ 3,6 = 20 m·s−1.

When converting m·s−1to km·h−1, you multiply by 3,6. For example 30 m·s−1×3,6 = 108 km·h−1.

Converting temperature

Converting between the kelvin and celsius temperature scales is easy. To convert from celsius

to kelvin add 273. To convert from kelvin to celsius subtract 273. Representing the kelvin

temperature by TK and the celsius temperature by ToC ,

TK = ToC + 273
