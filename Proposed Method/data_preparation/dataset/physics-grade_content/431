28.2.1 Electrical generators

AC generator

The principle of rotating a conductor in a magnetic field is used in electricity generators. A

generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Definition: Generator

A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

The layout of an AC generator is shown in Figure 28.3. The conductor in the shape of a coil is

connected to a ring. The conductor is then manually rotated in the magnetic field generating

an alternating emf. The slip rings are connected to the load via brushes.

If a machine is constructed to rotate a magnetic field around a set of stationary wire coils with

the turning of a shaft, AC voltage will be produced across the wire coils as that shaft is

rotated, in accordance with Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic

operating principle of an AC generator.

In an AC generator the two ends of the coil are each attached to a slip ring that makes contact

with brushes as the coil turns. The direction of the current changes with every half turn of the

coil. As one side of the loop moves to the other pole of the magnetic field, the current in it

changes direction. The two slip rings of the AC generator allow the current to change

directions and become alternating current.

Itneterreessttinigng AC generators are also known as alternators. They are found in motor cars to

FFacctt charge the car battery.

DC generator

A DC generator is constructed the same way as an AC generator except that there is one slip

ring which is split into two pieces, called a commutator, so the current in the external circuit

does not change direction. The layout of a DC generator is shown in Figure 28.4. The

split-ring commutator accommodates for the change in direction of the current in the loop,

thus creating DC current going through the brushes and out to the circuit.

The shape of the emf from a DC generator is shown in Figure 28.5. The emf is not steady but

is more or less the positive halves of a sine wave.

AC versus DC generators

The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with a moving coil should

be obvious (sparking and heat), especially if the shaft of the generator is revolving at high

speed. If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapors, the

practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater.

An AC generator (alternator) does not require brushes and commutators to work, and so is

immune to these problems experienced by DC generators. The benefits of AC over DC with

regard to generator design is also reflected in electric motors. While DC motors require the use

of brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire, AC motors do not. In fact, AC

and DC motor designs are very similar to their generator counterparts. The AC motor being

dependent upon the reversing magnetic field produced by alternating current through its

stationary coils of wire to rotate the rotating magnet around on its shaft, and the DC motor

being dependent on the brush contacts making and breaking connections to reverse current

through the rotating coil every 1/2 rotation (180 degrees).
