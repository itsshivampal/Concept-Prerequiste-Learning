12.3.7 Exercise

1. A 12 kg box is placed on a rough surface. A force of 20 N applied at an angle of 30◦ to

the horizontal cannot move the box. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the normal

and friction forces.

2. A 100 kg crate is placed on a slope that makes an angle of 45◦ with the horizontal. The box

does not slide down the slope. Calculate the magnitude and acceleration of the frictional

force and the normal force present in this situation.

3. What force T at an angle of 30◦ above the horizontal, is required to drag a block weighing

20 N to the right at constant speed, if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block

and the surface is 0,20?

4. A block weighing 20 N rests on a horizontal surface. The coefficient of static friction

between the block and the surface is 0,40 and the coefficient of dynamic friction is 0,20.

4.1 What is the magnitude of the frictional force exerted on the block while the block is

at rest?

4.2 What will the magnitude of the frictional force be if a horizontal force of 5 N is

exerted on the block?

4.3 What is the minimum force required to start the block moving?

4.4 What is the minimum force required to keep the block in motion once it has been

started?

4.5 If the horizontal force is 10 N, determine the frictional force.

5. A stationary block of mass 3kg is on top of a plane inclined at 35◦ to the horizontal.

5.1 Draw a force diagram (not to scale). Include the weight of the block as well as the

components of the weight that are perpendicular and parallel to the inclined plane.

5.2 Determine the values of the weight's perpendicular and parallel components.

5.3 There exists a frictional force between the block and plane. Determine this force

(magnitude and direction).

6. A lady injured her back when she slipped and fell in a supermarket. She holds the owner

of the supermarket accountable for her medical expenses. The owner claims that the

floor covering was not wet and meets the accepted standards. He therefore cannot accept

responsibility. The matter eventually ends up in court. Before passing judgement, the

judge approaches you, a science student, to determine whether the coefficient of static

friction of the floor is a minimum of 0,5 as required. He provides you with a tile from the

floor, as well as one of the shoes the lady was wearing on the day of the incident.

6.1 Write down an expression for the coefficient of static friction.

6.2 Plan an investigation that you will perform to assist the judge in his judgement.

Follow the steps outlined below to ensure that your plan meets the requirements.

i. Formulate an investigation question.

ii. Apparatus: List all the other apparatus, except the tile and the shoe, that you

will need.

iii. A stepwise method: How will you perform the investigation? Include a relevant,

labelled free body-diagram.

iv. Results: What will you record?

v. Conclusion: How will you interpret the results to draw a conclusion?

CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11 12.3

Ff = µsN

8 = µs(32)

µs = 0,25

Note that the coefficient of friction does not have a unit as it shows a ratio. The value

for the coefficient of friction friction can have any value up to a maximum of 0,25.

When a force less than 8 N is applied, the coefficient of friction will be less than 0,25.

Step 3 : Find the coefficient of kinetic friction

The coefficient of kinetic friction is sometimes also called the coefficient of dynamic

friction. Here we look at when the block is moving:

Ff = µkN

4 = µk(32)

µk = 0,125
