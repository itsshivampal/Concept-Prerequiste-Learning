15.2.3 Tone

Tone is a measure of the quality of the sound wave. For example, the quality of the sound

produced in a particular musical instruments depends on which harmonics are superposed and

in which proportions. The harmonics are determined by the standing waves that are produced

in the instrument. Chapter 16 will explain the physics of music in greater detail.

The quality (timbre) of the sound heard depends on the pattern of the incoming vibrations, i.e.

the shape of the sound wave. The more irregular the vibrations, the more jagged is the shape

of the sound wave and the harsher is the sound heard.

15.2.1 Pitch

The frequency of a sound wave is what your ear understands as pitch. A higher frequency

sound has a higher pitch, and a lower frequency sound has a lower pitch. In Figure 15.1 sound

A has a higher pitch than sound B. For instance, the chirp of a bird would have a high pitch,

but the roar of a lion would have a low pitch.

The human ear can detect a wide range of frequencies. Frequencies from 20 to 20 000 Hz are

audible to the human ear. Any sound with a frequency below 20 Hz is known as an infrasound

and any sound with a frequency above 20 000 Hz is known as an ultrasound.

Table 15.1 lists the ranges of some common animals compared to humans.

Table 15.1: Range of frequencies

lower frequency (Hz) upper frequency (Hz)

Humans 20 20 000

Dogs 50 45 000

Cats 45 85 000

Bats 120 000

Dolphins 200 000

Elephants 5 10 000

Activity :: Investigation : Range of Wavelengths

Using the information given in Table 15.1, calculate the lower and upper

wavelengths that each species can hear. Assume the speed of sound in air is

344 m·s−1.

15.2.2 Loudness

The amplitude of a sound wave determines its loudness or volume. A larger amplitude means a

louder sound, and a smaller amplitude means a softer sound. In Figure 15.1 sound C is louder

than sound B. The vibration of a source sets the amplitude of a wave. It transmits energy into

the medium through its vibration. More energetic vibration corresponds to larger amplitude.

The molecules move back and forth more vigorously.

The loudness of a sound is also determined by the sensitivity of the ear. The human ear is more

sensitive to some frequencies than to others. Loudness thus depends on both the amplitude of

a sound wave and its frequency whether it lies in a region where the ear is more or less sensitive.

15.2.3 Tone

Tone is a measure of the quality of the sound wave. For example, the quality of the sound

produced in a particular musical instruments depends on which harmonics are superposed and

in which proportions. The harmonics are determined by the standing waves that are produced

in the instrument. Chapter 16 will explain the physics of music in greater detail.

The quality (timbre) of the sound heard depends on the pattern of the incoming vibrations, i.e.

the shape of the sound wave. The more irregular the vibrations, the more jagged is the shape

of the sound wave and the harsher is the sound heard.
