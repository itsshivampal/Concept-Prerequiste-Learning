21.2.2 Equations of Motion

The equations of motion that were used in Chapter 4 to describe free fall can be used for

projectile motion. These equations are the same as those equations that were derived in

Chapter 3, but with a = g. We use g = 9,8m · s−2 for our calculations.

vi = initial velocity (m·s−1) at t = 0 s

vf = final velocity (m·s−1) at time t

∆x = height above ground (m)

t = time (s)

∆t = time interval (s)

g = acceleration due to gravity (m·s−2)

vf = vi + gt (21.1)

∆x = t (21.2)

Worked Example 132: Projectile motion

CHAPTER 21. MOTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS - GRADE 12 21.2

Step 1 : Identify what is required and what is given

We are required to determine the maximum height reached by the ball and how

long it takes to reach this height. We are given the initial velocity vi = 10

m·s−1and the acceleration due to gravity g = 9,8 m·s−2.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

Choose down as positive. We know that at the maximum height the velocity of the

ball is 0 m·s−1. We therefore have the following:

• vi = −10m · s−1 (it is negative because we chose upwards as positive)

• vf = 0m · s−1

• g = +9,8m · s−2

Step 3 : Identify the appropriate equation to determine the height.

We can use:

v2f = v

2

i + 2g∆x

to solve for the height.

Step 4 : Substitute the values in and find the height.

v2f = v

2

i + 2g∆x

(0)2 = (−10)2 + (2)(9,8)(∆x)

−100 = 19,6∆x

∆x = 5,102...m

The value for the displacement will be negative because the displacement is

upwards and we have chosen downward as positive (and upward as negative). The

height will be a positive number, h = 5.10m.

Step 5 : Identify the appropriate equation to determine the time.

We can use:

vf = vi + gt

to solve for the time.

Step 6 : Substitute the values in and find the time.

vf = vi + gt

0 = −10 + 9,8t

10 = 9,8t

t = 1,02...s

Step 7 : Write the final answer.

The ball reaches a maximum height of 5,10 m.

The ball takes 1,02 s to reach the top.

Worked Example 133: Height of a projectile

Question: A cricketer hits a cricket ball from the ground so that it goes directly

upwards. If the ball takes, 10 s to return to the ground, determine its maximum

height.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what is required and what is given

We need to find how high the ball goes. We know that it takes 10 seconds to go

up and down. We do not know what the initial velocity of the ball (vi) is.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

We are required to determine the maximum height reached by the ball and how
long it takes to reach this height. We are given the initial velocity vi = 10
m·s−1and the acceleration due to gravity g = 9,8 m·s−2.
Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem
Choose down as positive. We know that at the maximum height the velocity of the
ball is 0 m·s−1. We therefore have the following:
• vi = −10m · s−1 (it is negative because we chose upwards as positive)
• vf = 0m · s−1

21.2 CHAPTER 21. MOTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS - GRADE 12
A problem like this one can be looked at as
if there are two motions. The first is the ball
going up with an initial velocity and stopping
at the top (final velocity is zero). The second
motion is the ball falling, its initial velocity is
zero and its final velocity is unknown.
vf = 0 m·s−1 vi = 0 m·s−1
g = 9,8 m·s−2
vi = ? vf = ?
Choose down as positive. We know that at the maximum height, the velocity of
the ball is 0 m·s−1. We also know that the ball takes the same time to reach its
maximum height as it takes to travel from its maximum height to the ground. This
time is half the total time. We therefore have the following for the motion of the
ball going down:
• t = 5 s, half of the total time
• vtop = vi = 0m · s−1
• g = 9,8m · s−2
• ∆x = ?
Step 3 : Find an appropriate equation to use
We are not given the initial velocity of the ball going up and therefore we do not
have the final velocity of the ball coming down. We need to choose an equation
that does not have vf in it. We can use the following equation to solve for ∆x:

∆x = vit+ gt

Step 4 : Substitute values and find the height.

Step 5 : Write the final answer
The ball reaches a maximum height of 122,5 m.
