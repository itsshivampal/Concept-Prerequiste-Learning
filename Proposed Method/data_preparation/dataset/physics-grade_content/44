4.1.1 Differences between Mass and Weight

Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is the amount of matter in an object. An object's mass

does not change unless matter is added or removed from the object.

The differences between mass and weight can be summarised in the following table:

Mass Weight

1. is a measure of how many 1. is the force with which the

molecules there are in an object. Earth attracts an object.

2. is measured in kilograms. 2. is measured in newtons

3. is the same on any planet. 3. is different on different planets.

4. is a scalar. 4. is a vector.

Exercise: Weight

1. A bag of sugar has a mass of 1 kg. How much does it weigh:

(a) on Earth?

(b) on Jupiter?

(c) on Pluto?

2. Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the surface of the Moon. The

gravitational acceleration on the Moon is 16 of the gravitational acceleration on

Earth, and there is no gravitational acceleration in outer space. If Neil's mass

was 90 kg, what was his weight:

(a) on Earth?

68

(b) on the Moon?

(c) in outer space?

3. A monkey has a mass of 15 kg on Earth. The monkey travels to Mars. What

is his mass and weight on Mars?

4. Determine your mass by using a bathroom scale and calculate your weight for

each planet in the Solar System, using the values given in Table 4.1

(multiples of g on Earth)

Mercury 0.376

Venus 0.903

Earth 1

Mars 0.38

Jupiter 2.34

Saturn 1.16

Uranus 1.15

Neptune 1.19

Pluto 0.066

Table 4.1: A list of the gravitational accelerations at the surfaces of each of the planets in our

solar system. Values are listed as multiples of g on Earth. Note: The "surface" is taken to

mean the cloud tops of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).

Step 2 : Calculate her mass on Mars

Sarah's mass does not change because she is still made up of the same amount of

matter. Her mass on Mars is therefore 50 kg.

Step 3 : Calculate her weight on Mars

Sarah′s weight = 50× 0,38× 9,8

= 186,2 N
