14.2 What is a longitudinal wave?

Definition: Longitudinal waves

A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the

direction of propagation of the wave.

When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the

particles of the medium and the motion of the save itself. We will do the same for longitudinal

waves.

The question is how do we construct such a wave?

To create a transverse wave, we flick the end of for example a rope up and down. The particles

move up and down and return to their equilibrium position. The wave moves from left to right

and will be displaced.

A longitudinal wave is seen best in a spring that is hung from a ceiling. Do the following

investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves.

14.3 CHAPTER 14. LONGITUDINAL WAVES - GRADE 11

1. Take a spring and hang it from the ceiling. Pull the free end of the spring and

release it. Observe what happens.

pull on spring and release

2. In which direction does the disturbance move?

3. What happens when the disturbance reaches the ceiling?

4. Tie a ribbon to the middle of the spring. Watch carefully what happens to the

ribbon when the free end of the spring is pulled and released. Describe the

motion of the ribbon.

From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves in the same direction

as the direction in which the spring was pulled. The spring was pulled up and down and the

wave also moved up and down. The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the

medium. The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave. The ribbon

moves from rest upwards, then back to its original position, then down and then back to its

original position.

Longitudinal Waves - Grade 11

14.1 Introduction

In Grade 10 we studied pulses and waves. We looked at transverse waves more closely. In this

chapter we look at another type of wave called longitudinal waves. In transverse waves, the

motion of the particles in the medium were perpendicular to the direction of the wave. In

longitudinal waves, the particles in the medium move parallel (in the same direction as) to the

motion of the wave. Examples of transverse waves are water waves or light waves. An example

of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave.
