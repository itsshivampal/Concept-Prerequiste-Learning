17.3.2 Positive charge acting on a test charge

At each point we calculate the force on a test charge, q, and represent this force by a vector.

+Q

We can see that at every point the positive test charge, q, would experience a force pushing it

away from the charge, Q. This is because both charges are positive and so they repel. Also

notice that at points further away the vectors are shorter. That is because the force is smaller

if you are further away.

Negative charge acting on a test charge

If the charge were negative we would have the following result.

-Q

Notice that it is almost identical to the positive charge case. This is important - the arrows

are the same length because the magnitude of the charge is the same and so is the magnitude

of the test charge. Thus the magnitude (size) of the force is the same. The arrows point in

the opposite direction because the charges now have opposite sign and so the test charge is

attracted to the charge. Now, to make things simpler, we draw continuous lines showing the

path that the test charge would travel. This means we don't have to work out the magnitude

of the force at many different points.

Electric field map due to a positive charge

+Q

Some important points to remember about electric fields:

• There is an electric field at every point in space surrounding a charge.

• Field lines are merely a representation - they are not real. When we draw them, we just

pick convenient places to indicate the field in space.

• Field lines always start at a right-angle (90o) to the charged object causing the field.

• Field lines never cross.

Definition: Electric field

An electric field as a region of space in which an electric charge experiences a force. The

direction of the electric field at a point is the direction that a positive test charge would

move if placed at that point.

17.3.1 Electric field lines

The maps depend very much on the charge or charges that the map is being made for. We will

start off with the simplest possible case. Take a single positive charge with no other charges

around it. First, we will look at what effects it would have on a test charge at a number of

points.

Electric field lines, like the magnetic field lines that were studied in Grade 10, are a way of

representing the electric field at a point.

• Arrows on the field lines indicate the direction of the field, i.e. the direction a positive

test charge would move.

• Electric field lines therefore point away from positive charges and towards negative

charges.

• Field lines are drawn closer together where the field is stronger.
