17.3.3 Combined charge distributions

We will now look at the field of a positive charge and a negative charge placed next to each

other. The net resulting field would be the addition of the fields from each of the charges. To

start off with let us sketch the field maps for each of the charges separately.

Electric field of a negative and a positive charge in isolation

+Q -Q

Notice that a test charge starting off directly between the two would be pushed away from the

positive charge and pulled towards the negative charge in a straight line. The path it would

follow would be a straight line between the charges.

+Q -Q

Now let's consider a test charge starting off a bit higher than directly between the charges. If it

starts closer to the positive charge the force it feels from the positive charge is greater, but the

negative charge also attracts it, so it would move away from the positive charge with a tiny

force attracting it towards the negative charge. As it gets further from the positive charge the

force from the negative and positive charges change and they are equal in magnitude at equal

distances from the charges. After that point the negative charge starts to exert a stronger force

on the test charge. This means that the test charge moves towards the negative charge with

only a small force away from the positive charge.

Now we can fill in the other lines quite easily using the same ideas. The resulting field map is:

Two like charges : both positive
For the case of two positive charges things look a little different. We can't just turn the arrows
around the way we did before. In this case the test charge is repelled by both charges. This
tells us that a test charge will never cross half way because the force of repulsion from both
charges will be equal in magnitude.
+Q +Q
The field directly between the charges cancels out in the middle. The force has equal
magnitude and opposite direction. Interesting things happen when we look at test charges that
are not on a line directly between the two.
+Q +Q
We know that a charge the same distance below the middle will experience a force along a
reflected line, because the problem is symmetric (i.e. if we flipped vertically it would look the
same). This is also true in the horizontal direction. So we use this fact to easily draw in the
next four lines.
+Q +Q
Working through a number of possible starting points for the test charge we can show the
electric field map to be:

Two like charges : both negative

We can use the fact that the direction of the force is reversed for a test charge if you change

the sign of the charge that is influencing it. If we change to the case where both charges are

negative we get the following result:
