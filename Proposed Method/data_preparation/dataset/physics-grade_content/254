14.4 Graphs of Particle Position, Displacement, Velocity

and Acceleration

When a longitudinal wave moves through the medium, the particles in the medium only move

back and forth relative to the direction of motion of the wave. We can see this in Figure 14.4

which shows the motion of the particles in a medium as a longitudinal wave moves through the

medium.

Important: A particle in the medium only moves back and forth when a longitudinal wave

moves through the medium.

As in Chapter 6, we can draw a graph of the particle's position as a function of time. For the

wave shown in Figure 14.4, we can draw the graph shown in Figure 14.5 for particle 0. The

graph for each of the other particles will be identical.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach based on what is given

We need to find the link between period, wavelength and wave speed.

Step 3 : Discuss how the period changes

We know that the frequency of a longitudinal wave is dependent on the frequency

of the vibrations that lead to the creation of the longitudinal wave. Therefore, the

frequency is always unchanged, irrespective of any changes in speed. Since the

period is the inverse of the frequency, the period remains the same.

Step 4 : Discuss how the wavelength changes

The frequency remains unchanged. According to the wave equation

v = fλ

if f remains the same and v increases, then λ, the wavelength, must also increase.
