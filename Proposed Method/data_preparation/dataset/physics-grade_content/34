3.6.3 Motion at Constant Acceleration

The final situation we will be studying is motion at constant acceleration. We know that

acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So, if we have a constant acceleration, this

means that the velocity changes at a constant rate.

Let's look at our first example of Lesedi waiting at the taxi stop again. A taxi arrived and Lesedi

got in. The taxi stopped at the stop street and then accelerated as follows: After 1 s the taxi

covered a distance of 2,5 m, after 2 s it covered 10 m, after 3 seconds it covered 22,5 m and

after 4 s it covered 40 m. The taxi is covering a larger distance every second. This means that

it is accelerating.

STOP

2,5 m 10 m 22,5 m 40 m

t = 1 s t = 2 s t = 3 s t = 4 s

To calculate the velocity of the taxi you need to calculate the gradient of the line at each second:

∆x ∆x ∆x

v1s = v2s = v3s =

∆t ∆t ∆t

xf − xi xf − xi xf − xi

=

tf − = f − =ti t ti tf − ti

5m− 0m 15m− 5m 30m− 15m

=

1,5s− = 2,5s− =0,5s 1,5s 3,5s− 2,5s

= 5 m · s−1 = 10 m · s−1 = 15 m · s−1

From these velocities, we can draw the velocity-time graph which forms a straight line.

The acceleration is the gradient of the v vs. t graph and can be calculated as follows:

∆v

a =

∆t

vf − vi

=

tf − ti

15m · s−1 − 5m · s−1

=

3s− 1s

= 5 m · s−2

The acceleration does not change during the motion (the gradient stays constant). This is

motion at constant or uniform acceleration.

The graphs for this situation are shown in Figure 3.9.

Velocity from Acceleration vs. Time Graphs

Just as we used velocity vs. time graphs to find displacement, we can use acceleration vs. time

graphs to find the velocity of an object at a given moment in time. We simply calculate the

area under the acceleration vs. time graph, at a given time. In the graph below, showing an

object at a constant positive acceleration, the increase in velocity of the object after 2 seconds

corresponds to the shaded portion.

v = area of rectangle = a×∆t

= 5 m · s−2 × 2 s

= 10m · s−1

The velocity of the object at t = 2 s is therefore 10 m·s−1. This corresponds with the values

obtained in Figure 3.9.
