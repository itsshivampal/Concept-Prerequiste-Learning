28.2.2 Electric motors

The basic principles of operation for a motor are the same as that of a generator, except that a

motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Definition: Motor

An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Both motors and generators can be explained in terms of a coil that rotates in a magnetic field.

In a generator the coil is attached to an external circuit and it is mechanically turned, resulting

in a changing flux that induces an emf. In a motor, a current-carrying coil in a magnetic field

experiences a force on both sides of the coil, creating a torque which makes it turn.

Any coil carrying current can feel a force in a magnetic field, the force is the Lorentz force on

the moving charges in the conductor. We know that if the coil is parallel to the magnetic field

then the Lorentz force will be zero. The charge of opposite sides of the coil will be in opposite

directions because the charges are moving in opposite directions. This means the coil will

rotate.

Instead of rotating the loops through a magnetic field to create electricity, a current is sent

through the wires, creating electromagnets. The outer magnets will then repel the

electromagnets and rotate the shaft as an electric motor. If the current is AC, the two slip

rings are required to create an AC motor. An AC motor is shown in Figure 28.6

If the current is DC, split-ring commutators are required to create a DC motor. This is shown

in Figure 28.7.
