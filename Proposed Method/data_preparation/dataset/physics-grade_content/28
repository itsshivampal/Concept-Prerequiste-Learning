Question: James walks 2 km away from home in 30 minutes. He then turns around
and walks back home along the same path, also in 30 minutes. Calculate James'
average speed and average velocity.
2 km
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
The question explicitly gives
• the distance and time out (2 km in 30 minutes)
• the distance and time back (2 km in 30 minutes)
Step 2 : Check that all units are SI units.
The information is not in SI units and must therefore be converted.
To convert km to m, we know that:
1 km = 1 000 m
∴ 2 km = 2 000 m (multiply both sides by 2, because we want to convert 2 km to m.)
Similarly, to convert 30 minutes to seconds,
1 min = 60s
∴ 30 min = 1 800 s (multiply both sides by 30)
Step 3 : Determine James' displacement and distance.
James started at home and returned home, so his displacement is 0 m.
∆x = 0 m
James walked a total distance of 4 000 m (2 000 m out and 2 000 m back).
d = 4 000 m
Step 4 : Determine his total time.
James took 1 800 s to walk out and 1 800 s to walk back.
∆t = 3 600 s

Question: A man runs around a circular track of radius 100 m. It takes him 120 s
to complete a revolution of the track. If he runs at constant speed, calculate: W E
1. his speed,
b
2. his instantaneous velocity at point A, A S
3. his instantaneous velocity at point B, Direction the man runs
100 m
b
4. his average velocity between points A and B, B
5. his average speed during a revolution.
6. his average velocity during a revolution.
Answer
Step 1 : Decide how to approach the problem
To determine the man's speed we need to know the distance he travels and how
long it takes. We know it takes 120 s to complete one revolution of the track.(A
revolution is to go around the track once.)

3.4 CHAPTER 3. MOTION IN ONE DIMENSION - GRADE 10
Step 2 : Determine the distance travelled
What distance is one revolution of the track? We know the track is a circle and we
know its radius, so we can determine the distance around the circle. We start with
the equation for the circumference of a circle
C = 2πr
= 2π(100m)
= 628,32m
Therefore, the distance the man covers in one revolution is 628,32 m.
Step 3 : Determine the speed
d
We know that speed is distance covered per unit s = ∆t
time. So if we divide the distance covered by the 628,32m
time it took we will know how much distance was = 120 s
covered for every unit of time. No direction is = 5,24m · s−1
used here because speed is a scalar.
Step 4 : Determine the instantaneous velocity at A

A
Consider the point A in the diagram.
We know which way the man is running around Direction the man runs
the track and we know his speed. His velocity
at point A will be his speed (the magnitude of
the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the
direction of his velocity). The instant that he
arrives at A he is moving as indicated in the
diagram.
b
His velocity will be 5,24 m·s−1West. A
Step 5 : Determine the instantaneous velocity at B
Direction the man runs
Consider the point B in the diagram. bB
We know which way the man is running around
the track and we know his speed. His velocity
at point B will be his speed (the magnitude of
the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the
direction of his velocity). The instant that he
arrives at B he is moving as indicated in the
diagram.
His velocity will be 5,24 m·s−1South.

Step 2 : Determine the distance travelled

What distance is one revolution of the track? We know the track is a circle and we

know its radius, so we can determine the distance around the circle. We start with

the equation for the circumference of a circle

C = 2πr

= 2π(100m)

= 628,32m

Therefore, the distance the man covers in one revolution is 628,32 m.

Step 3 : Determine the speed

d

We know that speed is distance covered per unit s = ∆t

time. So if we divide the distance covered by the 628,32m

time it took we will know how much distance was = 120 s

covered for every unit of time. No direction is = 5,24m · s−1

used here because speed is a scalar.

Step 4 : Determine the instantaneous velocity at A

b

A

Consider the point A in the diagram.

We know which way the man is running around Direction the man runs

the track and we know his speed. His velocity

at point A will be his speed (the magnitude of

the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the

direction of his velocity). The instant that he

arrives at A he is moving as indicated in the

diagram.

b

His velocity will be 5,24 m·s−1West. A

Step 5 : Determine the instantaneous velocity at B

Direction the man runs

Consider the point B in the diagram. bB

We know which way the man is running around

the track and we know his speed. His velocity

at point B will be his speed (the magnitude of

the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the

direction of his velocity). The instant that he

arrives at B he is moving as indicated in the

diagram.

His velocity will be 5,24 m·s−1South.

Step 6 : Determine the average velocity between A and B

To determine the average velocity between A and B, we need the change in displace-

ment between A and B and the change in time between A and B. The displacement

from A and B can be calculated by using the Theorem of Pythagoras:

(∆x)2 = 1002 + 1002

= 20000

∆x = 141,42135... m A

The time for a full revolution is 120 s, therefore ∆x

the time for a 14 of a revolution is 30 s.

141,42... B 100 Om

= 4.71 m · s−1

Velocity is a vector and needs a direction.

Triangle AOB is isosceles and therefore angle BAO = 45◦.

The direction is between west and south and is therefore southwest.

The final answer is: v = 4.71 m·s−1, southwest.

Step 7 : Determine his average speed during a revolution

Because he runs at a constant rate, we know that his speed anywhere around the

track will be the same. His average speed is 5,24 m·s−1.

Step 8 : Determine his average velocity over a complete revolution

Important: Remember - displacement can be zero even when distance travelled is not!

To calculate average velocity we need his total displacement and his total time. His

displacement is zero because he ends up where he started. His time is 120 s. Using

these we can calculate his average velocity:
