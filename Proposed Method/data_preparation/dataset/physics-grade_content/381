23.3.1 External and Internal Forces

In Grade 10, you saw that mechanical energy was conserved in the absence of external forces.

It is important to know whether a force is an internal force or an external force, because this is

related to whether the force can change an object's total mechanical energy when it does work

upon an object.

Activity :: Investigations : External Forces

(NOTE TO SELF: need an activity that helps the learner investigate how

energy is lost when external forces do work on an object.)

When an external force (for example friction, air resistance, applied force) does work on an

object, the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) of that object changes. If positive work is done,

then the object will gain energy. If negative work is done, then the object will lose energy. The

gain or loss in energy can be in the form of potential energy, kinetic energy, or both. However,

the work which is done is equal to the change in mechanical energy of the object.

(NOTE TO SELF: need an activity that helps the learner investigate how

energy changes form when an internal force does work on an object.)

23.3 CHAPTER 23. WORK, ENERGY AND POWER - GRADE 12

When an internal force does work on an object by an (for example, gravitational and spring

forces), the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) of that object remains constant but the

object's energy can change form. For example, as an object falls in a gravitational field from a

high elevation to a lower elevation, some of the object's potential energy is changed into

kinetic energy. However, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remain constant. When

the only forces doing work are internal forces, energy changes forms - from kinetic to potential

(or vice versa); yet the total amount of mechanical is conserved.

8. A mother pushes down on a pram with a force of 50 N at an angle of 30◦.

The pram is moving on a frictionless surface. If the mother pushes the pram

for a horizontal distance of 30 m, how much does she do on the pram?

9. How much work is done by an applied force to raise a 2 000 N lift 5 floors

vertically at a constant speed? Each floor is 5 m high.

10. A student with a mass of 60 kg runs up three flights of stairs in 15 s, covering

a vertical distance of 10 m. Determine the amount of work done by the

student to elevate her body to this height. Assume that her speed is constant.
