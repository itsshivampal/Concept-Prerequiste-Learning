24.3.1 The Expanding Universe

Stars emit light, which is why we can see them at night. Galaxies are huge collections of stars.

An example is our own Galaxy, the Milky Way, of which our sun is only one of the millions of

stars! Using large telescopes like the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in the Karoo,

astronomers can measure the light from distant galaxies. The spectrum of light (see

Chapter ??) can tell us what elements are in the stars in the galaxies because each element

emits/absorbs light at particular wavelengths (called spectral lines). If these lines are observed

to be shifted from their usual wavelengths to shorter wavelengths, then the light from the

galaxy is said to be blueshifted. If the spectral lines are shifted to longer wavelengths, then the

light from the galaxy is said to be redshifted. If we think of the blueshift and redshift in

Doppler effect terms, then a blueshifted galaxy would appear to be moving towards us (the

observers) and a redshifted galaxy would appear to be moving away from us.

Important:

• If the light source is moving away from the observer (positive velocity) then the

observed frequency is lower and the observed wavelength is greater (redshifted).

• If the source is moving towards (negative velocity) the observer, the observed fre-

quency is higher and the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

Edwin Hubble (20 November 1889 - 28 September 1953) measured the Doppler shift of a large

sample of galaxies. He found that the light from distant galaxies is redshifted and he

discovered that there is a proportionality relationship between the redshift and the distance to

the galaxy. Galaxies that are further away always appear more redshifted than nearby galaxies.

Remember that a redshift in Doppler terms means a velocity of the light source away from the

observer. So why do all distant galaxies appear to be moving away from our Galaxy?

The reason is that the universe is expanding! The galaxies are not actually moving themselves,

rather the space between them is expanding!

effect affects sound waves when the source is moving. Therefore, if we apply the Doppler effect

to light, the frequency of the emitted light should change when the source of the light is

moving relative to the observer.

When the frequency of a sound wave changes, the sound you hear changes. When the

frequency of light changes, the colour you would see changes.

This means that the Doppler effect can be observed by a change in sound (for sound waves)

and a change in colour (for light waves). Keep in mind that there are sounds that we cannot

hear (for example ultrasound) and light that we cannot see (for example ultraviolet light).

We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to light. When talking

about light we use slightly different names to describe what happens. If you look at the colour

spectrum (more details Chapter 30) then you will see that blue light has shorter wavelengths

than red light. If you are in the middle of the visible colours then longer wavelengths are more

red and shorter wavelengths are more blue. So we call shifts towards longer wavelengths

"red-shifts" and shifts towards shorter wavelengths "blue-shifts".

wavelength (nm)

Figure 24.2: Blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light.

A shift in wavelength is the same as a shift in frequency. Longer wavelengths of light have

lower frequencies and shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies. From the Doppler effect we

know that when things move towards you any waves they emit that you measure are shifted to

shorter wavelengths (blueshifted). If things move away from you, the shift is to longer

wavelengths (redshifted).
