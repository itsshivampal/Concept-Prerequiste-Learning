11.5 Drawing Vectors

In order to draw a vector accurately we must specify a scale and include a reference direction in

the diagram. A scale allows us to translate the length of the arrow into the vector's magnitude.

For instance if one chose a scale of 1 cm = 2 N (1 cm represents 2 N), a force of 20 N towards

the East would be represented as an arrow 10 cm long. A reference direction may be a line

representing a horizontal surface or the points of a compass.

20 N S

Method: Drawing Vectors

1. Decide upon a scale and write it down.

2. Determine the length of the arrow representing the vector, by using the scale.

3. Draw the vector as an arrow. Make sure that you fill in the arrow head.

4. Fill in the magnitude of the vector.

Worked Example 49: Drawing vectors

Question: Represent the following vector quantities:

1. 6 m·s−1north

2. 16 m east

Answer

Step 1 : Decide upon a scale and write it down.

1. 1 cm = 2 m·s−1

2. 1 cm = 4 m

Step 2 : Determine the length of the arrow at the specific scale.

1. If 1 cm = 2 m·s−1, then 6 m·s−1= 3 cm

2. If 1 cm = 4 m, then 16 m = 4 cm

Step 3 : Draw the vectors as arrows.

1. Scale used: 1 cm = 2 m·s−1

Direction = North
