12.2.3 Systems and External Forces

The concepts of a system and an external forces are very important in Physics. A system is any

collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such a system then an external force

is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example a car pulling

two trailers.

B A

If we draw a box around the two trailers they can be considered a closed system or unit. When

we look at the forces on this closed system the following forces will apply:

• The force of the car pulling the unit (trailer A and B)

• The force of friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the

direction of motion)

• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system (gravity)

• The force of the road pushing upwards on the system

These forces are called external forces to the system.

The following forces will not apply:

• The force of A pulling B

• The force of B pulling A

• The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction

of motion)

We can also draw a box around trailer A or B, in which case the forces will be different.

B A

If we consider trailer A as a system, the following external forces will apply:

• The force of the car pulling on A (towards the right)

• The force of B pulling on A (towards the left)

• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity)

• The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer

Magnetic Forces

The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the

interaction between moving charges as opposed to the fixed charges involved in Coulomb's Law.

Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses,car engines and computer

data storage. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them

around sites.

Friction

According to Newton's First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving

without a force acting on it will keep on moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table stop?

The answer is friction. Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom

of a box with the molecules on a table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence

friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. Later in this chapter we will discuss

frictional forces a little more.

Drag Forces

This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium like an aeroplane flying

through air. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and

because of this the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you

move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports

car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from

high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way

to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show, the greater the

drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.

12.2.3 Systems and External Forces

The concepts of a system and an external forces are very important in Physics. A system is any

collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such a system then an external force

is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example a car pulling

two trailers.

B A

If we draw a box around the two trailers they can be considered a closed system or unit. When

we look at the forces on this closed system the following forces will apply:

• The force of the car pulling the unit (trailer A and B)

• The force of friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the

direction of motion)

• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system (gravity)

• The force of the road pushing upwards on the system

These forces are called external forces to the system.

The following forces will not apply:

• The force of A pulling B

• The force of B pulling A

• The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction

of motion)

We can also draw a box around trailer A or B, in which case the forces will be different.

B A

If we consider trailer A as a system, the following external forces will apply:

• The force of the car pulling on A (towards the right)

• The force of B pulling on A (towards the left)

• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity)

• The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer
