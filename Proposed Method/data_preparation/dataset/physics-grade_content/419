26.6.3 Mach Cone

You can see that the shape of the Mach Cone depends on the speed of the aircraft. When the

Mach Number is 1 there is no cone but as the aircraft goes faster and faster the angle of the

cone gets smaller and smaller.

If we go back to the supersonic picture we can work out what the angle of the cone must be.

supersonic shock wave

We build a triangle between how far the plane has moved and how far a wavefront at right

angles to the direction the plane is flying has moved:

An aircraft emits a sound wavefront. The wavefront moves at the speed of sound 340 m · s−1

and the aircraft moves at Mach 1.5, which is 1.5 × 340 = 510 m · s−1. The aircraft travels

faster than the wavefront. If we let the wavefront travel for a time t then the following diagram

will apply:

We know how fast the wavefront and the aircraft are moving so we know the distances that

they have traveled:

v vsound × taircraft × t

The angle between the cone that forms at the direction of the plane can be found from the

right-angle triangle we have drawn into the figure. We know that sin θ = opposite which in

hypotenuse

this figure means:

sin θ =

vsound × t

sin θ =

vaircraft × t

sin θ =

vaircraft

In this case we have used sound and aircraft but a more general way of saying this is:

• aircraft = source

• sound = wavefront

We often just write the equation as:

vsound

sin θ =

vaircraft

vaircraft sin θ = vsound

vsource sin θ = vwavefront

vs sin θ = vw

Exercise: Mach Cone

In this exercise we will determine the Mach Cone Angle for the different aircraft

in the table mentioned above. To help you get started we have calculated the

Mach Cone Angle for the Concorde with a speed of sound vsound = 340 m · s−1.

For the Condorde we know the speed and we know that:

vsound

sin θ =

For the Concorde this means that
