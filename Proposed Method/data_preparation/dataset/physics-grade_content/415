26.5.1 Diffraction through a Slit

When a wave strikes a barrier with a hole only part of the wave can move through the hole. If

the hole is similar in size to the wavelength of the wave diffractions occurs. The waves that

comes through the hole no longer looks like a straight wave front. It bends around the edges of

the hole. If the hole is small enough it acts like a point source of circular waves.

Now if allow the wavefront to impinge on a barrier with a hole in it, then only the points on

the wavefront that move into the hole can continue emitting forward moving waves - but

because a lot of the wavefront have been removed the points on the edges of the hole emit

waves that bend round the edges.

If you employ Huygens' principle you can see the effect is that the wavefronts are no longer

straight lines.

Each point of the slit acts like a point source. If we think about the two point sources on the

edges of the slit and call them A and B then we can go back to the diagram we had earlier but

with some parts block by the wall.

If this diagram were showing sound waves then the sound would be louder (constructive

interference) in some places and quieter (destructive interference) in others. You can start to

see that there will be a pattern (interference pattern) to the louder and quieter places. If we

were studying light waves then the light would be brighter in some places than others

depending on the interferences.

The intensity (how bright or loud) of the interference pattern for a single narrow slit looks like

this:

The picture above shows how the waves add together to form the interference pattern. The
peaks correspond to places where the waves are adding most intensely and the zeroes are
places where destructive interference is taking place. When looking at interference patterns
from light the spectrum looks like:
There is a formula we can use to determine where the peaks and minimums are in the
interference spectrum. There will be more than one minimum. There are the same number of
minima on either side of the central peak and the distances from the first one on each side are
the same to the peak. The distances to the peak from the second minimum on each side is
also the same, in fact the two sides are mirror images of each other. We label the first
minimum that corresponds to a positive angle from the centre as m = 1 and the first on the
other side (a negative angle from the centre as m = −1, the second set of minima are labelled
m = 2 and m = −2 etc.

The equation for the angle at which the minima occur is
Definition: Interference Minima
The angle at which the minima in the interference spectrum occur is:
mλ
sin θ =

where
θ is the angle to the minimum
λ is the wavelength of the impinging wavefronts
m is the order of the mimimum, m = ±1,±2,±3, ...

We know that we are dealing with interference patterns from the diffraction of light
passing through a slit. The slit has a width of 2511 nm which is 2511× 10−9 m
and we know that the wavelength of the light is 650 nm which is 650× 10−9 m.
We are looking to determine the angle to first minimum so we know that m = 1.
Step 2 : Applicable principles
We know that there is a relationship between the slit width, wavelength and
interference minimum angles:

We can use this relationship to find the angle to the minimum by substituting what
we know and solving for the angle.

θ = sin−1 0.211867782

θ = 12.2o

The first minimum is at 12.2 degrees from the centre peak.

From the formula you can see that a smaller wavelength for the same slit results in a smaller

angle to the interference minimum. This is something you just saw in the two worked

examples. Do a sanity check, go back and see if the answer makes sense. Ask yourself which

light had the longer wavelength, which light had the larger angle and what do you expect for

longer wavelengths from the formula.

passing through a slit. We know that the wavelength of the light is 532 nm which

is 532× 10−9 m. We know the angle to first minimum so we know that m = 1 and

θ = 20.77o.

Step 2 : Applicable principles

We know that there is a relationship between the slit width, wavelength and

interference minimum angles:
