18.3.1 Real-life applications

The following devices use Faraday's Law in their operation.

• induction stoves

• tape players

• metal detectors

• transformers

Activity :: Research Project : Real-life applications of Faraday's Law

Choose one of the following devices and do some research on the internet or in

a library how your device works. You will need to refer to Faraday's Law in your

explanation.

• induction stoves

• tape players

• metal detectors

• transformers

Exercise: Faraday's Law

1. State Faraday's Law in words and write down a mathematical relationship.

2. Describe what happens when a bar magnet is pushed into or pulled out of a

solenoid connected to an ammeter. Draw pictures to support your description.

3. Use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the induced current in

the solenoid below.
