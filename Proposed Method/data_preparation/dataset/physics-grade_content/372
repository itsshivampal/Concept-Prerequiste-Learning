22.4.2 Structure and failure of materials

Many substances fail because they have a weakness in their atomic structure. There are a

number of problems that can cause these weaknesses in structure. These are vacancies,

dislocations, grain boundaries and impurities.

Vacancies occur when there are spaces in the structure of a crystalline solid. These vacancies

cause weakness and the substance often fail at these places. Think about bricks in a wall, if

you started removing bricks the wall would get weaker.

Dislocations occur when there are no strong bonds between two rows in a crystal lattice. The

crystal will fail along this boundary when sufficient force is applied. The two pieces of the

crystal keep their shape and structure but move along the boundary.

Impurities in a crystal structure can cause a weak spot in the crystal lattice around the

impurity. Like vacancies, the substance often fail from these places in the lattice. This you can

think of as bricks in a wall which don't fit properly, they are the wrong kind of bricks (atoms)

to make the structure strong.

A difference in grain size in a crystal lattice will result in rusting or oxidation at the boundary

which again will result in failure when sufficient force is applied.
