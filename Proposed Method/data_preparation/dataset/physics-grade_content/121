8.3.1 The poles of permanent magnets

Because the domains in a permanent magnet all line up in a particular direction, the magnet

has a pair of opposite poles, called north (usually shortened to N) and south (usually shortened

to S). Even if the magnet is cut into tiny pieces, each piece will still have both a N and a S

pole. These poles always occur in pairs. In nature we never find a north magnetic pole or south

magnetic pole on its own.

Magnetic fields are different to gravitational and electric fields. In nature, positive and negative

electric charges can be found on their own, but you never find just a north magnetic pole or

south magnetic pole on its own. On the very small scale, zooming in to the size of atoms,

magnetic fields are caused by moving charges (i.e. the negatively charged electrons).
