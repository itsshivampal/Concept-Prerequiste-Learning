20.2 Conduction

We know that there are materials that do conduct electricity, called conductors, like the copper

wires in the circuits you build. There are also materials that do not conduct electricity, called

insulators, like the plastic covering on the copper wires.

Conductors come in two major categories: metals (e.g. copper) and semi-conductors (e.g.

silicon). Metals conduct very well and semi-conductors don't. One very interesting difference is

that metals conduct less as they become hotter but semi-conductors conduct more.

What is different about these substances that makes them conduct differently? That is what

we are about to find out.

We have learnt that electrons in an atom have discrete energy levels. When an electron is given

the right amount of energy, it can jump to a higher energy level, while if it loses the right

amount of energy it can drop to a lower energy level. The lowest energy level is known as the

ground state.

When two atoms are far apart from each other they don't influence each other. Look at the

picture below. There are two atoms depicted by the black dots. When they are far apart their

electron clouds (the gray clouds) are distinct. The dotted line depicts the distance of the

outermost electron energy level that is occupied.

In some lattice structures the atoms would be closer together. If they are close enough their

electron clouds, and therefore electron energy levels start to overlap. Look at the picture

below. In this picture the two atoms are closer together. The electron clouds now overlap. The

overlapping area is coloured in solid gray to make it easier to see.

b b

When this happens we might find two electrons with the same energy and spin in the same

space. We know that this is not allowed from the Pauli exclusion principle. Something must

change to allow the overlapping to happen. The change is that the energies of the energy

levels change a tiny bit so that the electrons are not in exactly the same spin and energy state

at the same time.

So if we have 2 atoms then in the overlapping area we will have twice the number of electrons

and energy levels but the energy levels from the different atoms will be very very close in

energy. If we had 3 atoms then there would be 3 energy levels very close in energy and so on.

In a solid there may be very many energy levels that are very close in energy. These groups of

energy levels are called bands. The spacing between these bands determines whether the solid

is a conductor or an insulator.

solid affect how the electrons of the atoms behave, by causing the individual energy levels of an

atom to break up and form energy bands. The resulting energy levels are more closely spaced

than those in the individual atoms. The energy bands still contain discrete energy levels, but

there are now many more energy levels than in the single atom.

In crystalline solids, atoms interact with their neighbors, and the energy levels of the electrons

in isolated atoms turn into bands. Whether a material conducts or not is determined by its

band structure.

Electrons follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that two electrons cannot occupy the

same state. Thus electrons in a solid fill up the energy bands up to a certain level (this is called

the Fermi energy). Bands which are completely full of electrons cannot conduct electricity,

because there is no state of nearby energy to which the electrons can jump. Materials in which

all bands are full are insulators.
