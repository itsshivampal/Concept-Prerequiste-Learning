CHAPTER 3. MOTION IN ONE DIMENSION - GRADE 10 3.9

Derivation of Equation 3.1

According to the definition of acceleration:

∆v

a =

t

where ∆v is the change in velocity, i.e. ∆v = vf - vi. Thus we have

vf − vi

a =

t

vf = vi + at

Derivation of Equation 3.2

We have seen that displacement can be calculated from the area under a velocity vs. time graph.

For uniformly accelerated motion the most complicated velocity vs. time graph we can have is

a straight line. Look at the graph below - it represents an object with a starting velocity of vi,

accelerating to a final velocity vf over a total time t.

To calculate the final displacement we must calculate the area under the graph - this is just

the area of the rectangle added to the area of the triangle. This portion of the graph has been

shaded for clarity.

Derivation of Equation 3.3
This equation is simply derived by eliminating the final velocity vf in equation 3.2. Remembering
from equation 3.1 that
vf = vi + at

Worked Example 12: Equations of motion
Question: A racing car is travelling north. It accelerates uniformly covering a
distance of 725 m in 10 s. If it has an initial velocity of 10 m·s−1, find its acceleration.
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
