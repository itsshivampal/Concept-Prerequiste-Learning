2.6 Prefixes of Base Units

Now that you know how to write numbers in scientific notation, another important aspect of

units is the prefixes that are used with the units.

Definition: Prefix

A prefix is a group of letters that are placed in front of a word. The effect of the prefix is to

change meaning of the word. For example, the prefix un is often added to a word to mean

not, as in unnecessary which means not necessary.

In the case of units, the prefixes have a special use. The kilogram (kg) is a simple example.

1 kg is equal to 1 000 g or 1 × 103 g. Grouping the 103 and the g together we can replace the

103 with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the 103.

The kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.

In Science, all the prefixes used with units are some power of 10. Table 2.4 lists some of

these prefixes. You will not use most of these prefixes, but those prefixes listed in bold should

be learnt. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the

table, it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents

less than one. For example M means mega (106) and m means milli (10−3).

Table 2.4: Unit Prefixes

Important: There is no space and no dot between the prefix and the symbol for the unit.

Here are some examples of the use of prefixes:

• 40000 m can be written as 40 km (kilometre)

• 0,001 g is the same as 1× 10−3 g and can be written as 1 mg (milligram)

• 2,5× 106 N can be written as 2,5 MN (meganewton)

• 250000 A can be written as 250 kA (kiloampere) or 0,250 MA (megaampere)

• 0,000000075 s can be written as 75 ns (nanoseconds)

• 3×10−7 mol can be rewritten as 0,3×10−6 mol, which is the same as 0,3 µmol (micromol)

Exercise: Using Scientific Notation

1. Write the following in scientific notation using Table 2.4 as a reference.

(a) 0,511 MV

(b) 10 cℓ

(c) 0,5 µm

(d) 250 nm

(e) 0,00035 hg
