27.3 The Electron Microscope

We have seen that under certain circumstances particles behave like waves. This idea is used in

the electron microscope which is a type of microscope that uses electrons to create an image of

the target. It has much higher magnification or resolving power than a normal light

microscope, up to two million times, allowing it to see smaller objects and details.

Let's first review how a regular optical microscope works. A beam of light is shone through a

thin target and the image is then magnified and focused using objective and ocular lenses. The

amount of light which passes through the target depends on the densities of the target since

the less dens regions allow more light to pass through than the denser regions. This means that

the beam of light which is partially transmitted through the target carries information about

the inner structure of the target.

The original form of the electron microscopy, the transmission electron microscopy, works in a

similar manner using electrons. In the electron microscope, electrons which are emitted by a

cathode are formed into a beam using magnetic lenses. This electron beam is then passed

through a very thin target. Again, the regions in the target with higher densities stop the

electrons more easily. So, the amount of electrons which pass through the different regions of

the target depend their densities. This means that the partially transmitted beam of electrons

carries information about the densities of the inner structure of the target. The spatial

variation in this information (the "image") is then magnified by a series of magnetic lenses and

it is recorded by hitting a fluorescent screen, photographic plate, or light sensitive sensor such

as a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. The image detected by the CCD may be displayed

in real time on a monitor or computer. In figure ?? is an image of the polio virus obtained with

a transmission electron microscope.

The structure of an optical and electron microscope are compared in figure 27.3. While the

optical microscope uses light and focuses using lenses, the electron microscope uses electrons

and focuses using electromagnets.

Itneterreessttinigng The first electron microscope prototype was built in 1931 by the German

FFacctt engineers Ernst Ruska and Maximillion Knoll. It was based on the ideas and

discoveries of Louis de Broglie. Although it was primitive and was not ideal for

practical use, the instrument was still capable of magnifying objects by four

hundred times. The first practical electron microscope was built at the

Although modern electron microscopes can magnify objects up to two million
times, they are still based upon Ruska's prototype and his correlation between
wavelength and resolution. The electron microscope is an integral part of many
laboratories. Researchers use it to examine biological materials (such as
microorganisms and cells), a variety of large molecules, medical biopsy samples,
metals and crystalline structures, and the characteristics of various surfaces.
Electron microscopes are very useful as they are able to magnify objects to a much higher
resolution. This is because their de Broglie wavelengths are so much smaller than that of
visible light. You hopefully remember that light is diffracted by objects which are separated by
a distance of about the same size as the wavelength of the light. This diffraction then prevents
you from being able to focus the transmitted light into an image. So the sizes at which
diffraction occurs for a beam of electrons is much smaller than those for visible light. This is
why you can magnify targets to a much higher order of magnification using electrons rather
than visible light.
Extension: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM)
There are high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) which have been built. However
their resolution is limited by spherical and chromatic aberration. Fortunately
though, software correction of the spherical aberration has allowed the production
of images with very high resolution. In fact the resolution is sufficient to show
carbon atoms in diamond separated by only 89 picometers and atoms in silicon at
78 picometers. This is at magnifications of 50 million times. The ability to
determine the positions of atoms within materials has made the HRTEM a very
useful tool for nano-technologies research. It is also very important for the
development of semiconductor devices for electronics and photonics.
Transmission electron microscopes produce two-dimensional images.
Extension: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) produces images by hitting the
target with a primary electron beam which then excites the surface of the target.
This causes secondary electrons to be emitted from the surface which are then
detected. So the the electron beam in the SEM is moved across the sample, while
detectors build an image from the secondary electrons.

Generally, the transmission electron microscope's resolution is about an order of

magnitude better than the SEM resolution, however, because the SEM image relies

on surface processes rather than transmission it is able to image bulk samples and

has a much greater depth of view, and so can produce images that are a good

representation of the 3D structure of the sample.
