7.3.1 Terminology

In Chapters 5 and 6 we saw that when a pulse or wave strikes a surface it is reflected. This means

that waves bounce off things. Sound waves bounce off walls, light waves bounce off mirrors,

radar waves bounce off aeroplanes and it can explain how bats can fly at night and avoid things

as thin as telephone wires. The phenomenon of reflection is a very important and useful one.

We will use the following terminology. The incoming light ray is called the incident ray. The

light ray moving away from the surface is the reflected ray. The most important characteristic

of these rays is their angles in relation to the reflecting surface. These angles are measured

with respect to the normal of the surface. The normal is an imaginary line perpendicular to

the surface. The angle of incidence, θi is measured between the incident ray and the surface

normal. The angle of reflection, θr is measured between the reflected ray and the surface

normal. This is shown in Figure 7.4.

When a ray of light is reflected, the reflected ray lies in the same plane as the incident ray and

the normal. This plane is called the plane of incidence and is shown in Figure 7.5.
