19.2.1 Definition of Ohm's Law

Activity :: Experiment : Ohm's Law

Aim:

In this experiment we will look at the relationship between the current going

through a resistor and the potential difference (voltage) across the same resistor.

A

V

Method:

1. Set up the circuit according to the circuit diagram.

2. Draw the following table in your lab book.

Voltage, V (V) Current, I (A)

1,5

3,0

4,5

6,0

3. Get your teacher to check the circuit before turning the power on.

4. Measure the current.

5. Add one more 1,5 V battery to the circuit and measure the current again.

6. Repeat until you have four batteries and you have completed your table.

7. Draw a graph of voltage versus current.

Results:

1. Does your experimental results verify Ohm's Law? Explain.

2. How would you go about finding the resistance of an unknown resistor using

only a power supply, a voltmeter and a known resistor R0?

1. Plot a graph of voltage (on the y-axis) and current (on the x-axis).

Conclusions:

1. What type of graph do you obtain (straight line, parabola, other curve)

2. Calculate the gradient of the graph.

3. Does your experimental results verify Ohm's Law? Explain.

4. How would you go about finding the resistance of an unknown resistor using

only a power supply, a voltmeter and a known resistor R0?

An important relationship between the current, voltage and resistance in a circuit was

discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and is called Ohm's Law.

Definition: Ohm's Law

The amount of electric current through a metal conductor, at a constant temperature, in a

circuit is proportional to the voltage across the conductor. Mathematically, Ohm's Law is

written:

V = R · I.

Ohm's Law tells us that if a conductor is at a constant temperature, the voltage across the

ends of the conductor is proportional to the current. This means that if we plot voltage on the

y-axis of a graph and current on the x-axis of the graph, we will get a straight-line. The

gradient of the straight-line graph is then the resistance of the conductor.
