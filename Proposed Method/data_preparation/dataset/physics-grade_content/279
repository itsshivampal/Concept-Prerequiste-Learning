16.6 Summary - The Physics of Music

1. Instruments produce sounds because they form standing waves in strings or pipes.

2. The fundamental frequency of a string or a pipe is its natural frequency. The wavelength

of the fundamental frequency is twice the length of the string or pipe.

3. The first harmonic is formed when the standing wave forms one whole wavelength in the

string or pipe. The second harmonic is formed when the standing wave forms 1 12

wavelengths in the string or pipe.

4. The frequency of a standing wave can be calculated with the equation f = v .

λ

5. The wavelength of a standing wave in a string fixed at both ends can be calculated using

λn =

2L

n−1 .

6. The wavelength of a standing wave in a pipe with both ends open can be calculated

using λn =

2L

n .

7. The wavelength of a standing wave in a pipe with one end open can be calculated using

λn =

4L

2n−1 .

8. Resonance takes place when a system is made to vibrate at its own natural frequency as

a result of vibrations received from another source of the same frequency.

The resultant waveform is very different from the fundamental frequency. Even though the two

waves have the same main frequency, they do not sound the same!
