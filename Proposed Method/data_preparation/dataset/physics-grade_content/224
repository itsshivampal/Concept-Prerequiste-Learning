12.6.2 Mechanical Advantage and Levers

We can use our knowlegde about the moments of forces (torque) to determine whether situations

are balanced. For example two mass pieces are placed on a seesaw as shown in Figure 12.20.

The one mass is 3 kg and the other is 6 kg. The masses are placed a distance 2 m and 1

m, respectively from the pivot. By looking at the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments, we

can determine whether the seesaw will pivot (move) or not. If the sum of the clockwise and

anti-clockwise moments is zero, the seesaw is in equilibrium (i.e. balanced).

Figure 12.20: The moments of force are balanced.

The clockwise moment can be calculated as follows:

τ = F⊥ · r

τ = (6)(9,8)(1)

τ = 58,8N ·m clockwise

The anti-clockwise moment can be calculated as follows:

τ = F⊥ · r

τ = (3)(9,8)(2)

τ = 58,8N ·m anti-clockwise

The sum of the moments of force will be zero:

12.6 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11

The resultant moment is zero as the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments of force are in op-

posite directions and therefore cancel each other.

As we see in Figure 12.20, we can use different distances away from a pivot to balance two

different forces. This principle is applied to a lever to make lifting a heavy object much easier.

Definition: Lever

A lever is a rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to multiply

the mechanical force that can be applied to another object.

effort load

Figure 12.21: A lever is used to put in a small effort to get out a large load.

Itneterreessttinigng Archimedes reputedly said: Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which

FFacctt to place it, and I shall move the world.

The concept of getting out more than the effort is termed mechanical advantage, and is one

example of the principle of moments. The lever allows to do less effort but for a greater distance.

For instance to lift a certain unit of weight with a lever with an effort of half a unit we need a

distance from the fulcrum in the effort's side to be twice the distance of the weight's side. It

also means that to lift the weight 1 meter we need to push the lever for 2 meter. The amount of

work done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the lever (in an ideal lever).

The lever only allows to trade effort for distance.

Ideally, this means that the mechanical advantage of a system is the ratio of the force that

performs the work (output or load) to the applied force (input or effort), assuming there is no

friction in the system. In reality, the mechanical advantage will be less than the ideal value by

an amount determined by the amount of friction.

load

mechanical advantage =

effort

For example, you want to raise an object of mass 100 kg. If the pivot is placed as shown in

Figure 12.22, what is the mechanical advantage of the lever?

In order to calculate mechanical advantage, we need to determine the load and effort.

Important: Effort is the input force and load is the output force.

The load is easy, it is simply the weight of the 100 kg object.

Fload = m · g = 100 kg · 9,8m · s−2 = 980N

The effort is found by balancing torques.

Fload · rload = Feffort · reffort

Since mechanical advantage is a ratio, it does not have any units.

Extension: Pulleys

Pulleys change the direction of a tension force on a flexible material, e.g. a rope or

cable. In addition, pulleys can be "added together" to create mechanical advantage,

by having the flexible material looped over several pulleys in turn. More loops and

pulleys increases the mechanical advantage.
