15.3 Speed of Sound

The speed of sound depends on the medium the sound is travelling in. Sound travels faster in

solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because the density of solids is

higher than that of liquids which means that the particles are closer together. Sound can be

transmitted more easily.

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. The hotter the medium

is, the faster its particles move and therefore the quicker the sound will travel through the

medium. When we heat a substance, the particles in that substance have more kinetic energy

and vibrate or move faster. Sound can therefore be transmitted more easily and quickly in

hotter substances.

Sound waves are pressure waves. The speed of sound will therefore be influenced by the

pressure of the medium through which it is travelling. At sea level the air pressure is higher

than high up on a mountain. Sound will travel faster at sea level where the air pressure is

higher than it would at places high above sea level.

Definition: Speed of sound

The speed of sound in air, at sea level, at a temperature of 21◦C and under normal atmo-

spheric conditions, is 344 m·s−1.
