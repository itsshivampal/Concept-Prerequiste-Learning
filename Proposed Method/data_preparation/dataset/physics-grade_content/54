4.6 Energy graphs

Let us consider our example of the suitcase on the cupboard, once more.

Let's look at each of these quantities and draw a graph for each. We will look at how each

quantity changes as the suitcase falls from the top to the bottom of the cupboard.

• Potential energy: The potential energy starts off at a maximum and decreases until it

reaches zero at the bottom of the cupboard. It had fallen a distance of 2 metres.

The potential energy is a maximum at the top.

The kinetic energy is zero at the top.

The mechanical energy will remain constant

throughout the motion and will always be a maximum.

The potential energy is zero at the bottom.

The kinetic energy is a maximum at the bottom

• Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy is zero at the start of the fall. When the suitcase

reaches the ground, the kinetic energy is a miximum. We also use distance on the x-axis.

• Mechanical energy: The mechanical energy is constant throughout the motion and is

always a maximum. At any point in time, when we add the potential energy and the

kinetic energy, we will get the same number.

2ghA = (vB)

2

This proves that the velocity of the ball is independent of its mass. It does not

matter what its mass is, it will always have the same velocity when it falls through

this height.

Step 4 : Calculate the velocity of the ball

We can use the equation above, or do the calculation from 'first principles':

(vB)

2 = 2ghA

(vB)

2 = (2)(9.8)(0,5)

(vB)

2 = √9,8

vB = 9,8 m · s−1

Exercise: Potential Energy

1. A tennis ball, of mass 120 g, is dropped from a height of 5 m. Ignore air

friction.

(a) What is the potential energy of the ball when it has fallen 3 m?

(b) What is the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?

2. A bullet, mass 50 g, is shot vertically up in the air with a muzzle velocity of 200

m·s−1. Use the Principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy to determine

the height that the bullet will reach. Ignore air friction.

3. A skier, mass 50 kg, is at the top of a 6,4 m ski slope.

(a) Determine the maximum velocity that she can reach when she skies to the

bottom of the slope.

(b) Do you think that she will reach this velocity? Why/Why not?

4. A pendulum bob of mass 1,5 kg, swings from a height A to the bottom of its

arc at B. The velocity of the bob at B is 4 m·s−1. Calculate the height A from

which the bob was released. Ignore the effects of air friction.

5. Prove that the velocity of an object, in free fall, in a closed system, is indepen-

dent of its mass.
