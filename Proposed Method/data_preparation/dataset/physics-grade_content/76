6.2.2 Amplitude and Wavelength

There are a few properties that we saw with pulses that also apply to waves. These are amplitude

and wavelength (we called this pulse length).

Definition: Amplitude

The amplitude is the maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position.

Fill in the table below by measuring the distance between the equilibrium and

each peak and troughs in the wave above. Use your ruler to measure the distances.

1. What can you say about your results?

2. Are the distances between the equilibrium position and each peak equal?

3. Are the distances between the equilibrium position and each trough equal?

4. Is the distance between the equilibrium position and peak equal to the distance

between equilibrium and trough?

As we have seen in the activity on amplitude, the distance between the peak and the equilibrium

position is equal to the distance between the trough and the equilibrium position. This distance

is known as the amplitude of the wave, and is the characteristic height of wave, above or below

the equilibrium position. Normally the symbol A is used to represent the amplitude of a wave.

The SI unit of amplitude is the metre (m).

Worked Example 25: Amplitude of Sea Waves

Question: If the peak of a wave measures 2m above the still water mark in the

harbour, what is the amplitude of the wave?

Answer

The definition of the amplitude is the height that the water rises to above when it

is still. This is exactly what we were told, so the amplitude is 2m.

3. Are the distances between troughs equal?

4. Is the distance between peaks equal to the distance between troughs?

As we have seen in the activity on wavelength, the distance between two adjacent peaks is the

same no matter which two adjacent peaks you choose. There is a fixed distance between the

peaks. Similarly, we have seen that there is a fixed distance between the troughs, no matter

which two troughs you look at. More importantly, the distance between two adjacent peaks is

the same as the distance between two adjacent troughs. This distance is call the wavelength of

the wave.

The symbol for the wavelength is λ (the Greek letter lambda) and wavelength is measured in

metres (m).
