7.5.6 Convex Mirrors

The second type of curved mirror we will study are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors have the shape

shown in Figure 7.20. As with a plane mirror, the principal axis is a line that is perpendicular to

the centre of the mirror.

We have defined the focal point as that point that is half-way along the principal axis between

the centre of curvature and the mirror. Now for a convex mirror, this point is behind the mirror.

A convex mirror has a negative focal length because the focal point is behind the mirror.

Figure 7.20: Convex mirror with principle axis, focal point (F) and centre of curvature (C). The

centre of the mirror is the optical centre (O).

To determine what the image from a convex mirror looks like and where the image is located,

we need to remember that a mirror obeys the laws of reflection and that light appears to come

from the image. The image created by a convex mirror is shown in Figure 7.21.

Figure 7.21: A convex mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image. Each incident ray is

reflected according to the Law of Reflection. The reflected rays diverge. If the reflected rays are

extended behind the mirror, then their intersection gives the location of the image behind the

mirror. For a convex mirror, the image is virtual and upright.

From Figure 7.21, we see that the image created by a convex mirror is virtual and upright, as

compared to the real and inverted image created by a concave mirror.

Extension: Divergence

A convex mirror is also known as a diverging mirror. Light rays appear to diverge

from the focal point of a convex mirror.

Definition: Real Image

A real image can be cast on a screen; it is inverted, and on the same side of the mirror as

the object.

Extension: Convergence

A concave mirror is also known as a converging mirror. Light rays appear to converge

to the focal point of a concave mirror.
