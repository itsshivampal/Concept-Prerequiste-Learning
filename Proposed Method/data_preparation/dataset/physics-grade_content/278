16.5 Music and Sound Quality

In the sound chapter, we referred to the quality of sound as its tone. What makes the tone of a

note played on an instrument? When you pluck a string or vibrate air in a tube, you hear

mostly the fundamental frequency. Higher harmonics are present, but are fainter. These are

called overtones. The tone of a note depends on its mixture of overtones. Different

instruments have different mixtures of overtones. This is why the same note sounds different

on a flute and a piano.

Let us see how overtones can change the shape of a wave:

The resultant waveform is very different from the fundamental frequency. Even though the two

waves have the same main frequency, they do not sound the same!

v = f × λ

= 512× 0,642

= 328,7 m.s−1

From the investigation you will notice that the column of air will make a sound at a certain

length. This is where resonance takes place.
