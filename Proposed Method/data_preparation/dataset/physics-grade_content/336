20.3.2 Deficiency

A deficiency of electrons is created by adding an element that has less valence electrons than Si

to the Si crystal. This is known as p-type doping and elements used for p-type doping usually

come from Group III in the periodic table. Elements from Group III have 3 valence electrons,

one less than the semiconductor elements that come from Group IV. A common p-type dopant

is boron (B). The combination of a semiconductor and a p-type dopant is known as an p-type

semiconductor. A Si crystal doped with B is shown in Figure 20.3. When B is mixed into the

silicon crystal, there is a Si valence electron that is left unbonded.

The lack of an electron is known as a hole and has the effect of a positive charge. Holes can

conduct current. A hole happily accepts an electron from a neighbor, moving the hole over a

space. Since p-type dopants ‘accept' electrons, they are known as acceptor atoms.

Figure 20.3: Si crystal doped with B. For each B atom present in the Si crystal, there is one

less electron. This combination of Si and B is known as a p-type semiconductor, because of its

overall deficiency of electrons.

Donor (n-type) impurities have extra valence electrons with energies very close to the

conduction band which can be easily thermally excited to the conduction band. Acceptor

(p-type) impurities capture electrons from the valence band, allowing the easy formation of

holes.

conduction band conduction band conduction band

donor atom

acceptor atom

valence band valence band valence band

intrinsic semiconductor n-type semiconductor p-type semiconductor

The energy level of the donor atom is close to the conduction band and it is relatively easy for

electrons to enter the conduction band. The energy level of the acceptor atom is close to the

valence band and it is relatively easy for electrons to leave the valence band and enter the

vacancies left by the holes.
