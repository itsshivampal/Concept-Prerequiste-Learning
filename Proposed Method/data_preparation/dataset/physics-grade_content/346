21.1 Introduction

In Chapter 3, we studied motion in one dimension and briefly looked at vertical motion. In this

chapter we will discuss vertical motion and also look at motion in two dimensions. In

Chapter 12, we studied the conservation of momentum and looked at applications in one

dimension. In this chapter we will look at momentum in two dimensions.
