26.6.2 Supersonic Flight

Definition: Supersonic

Supersonic refers to speeds faster than the speed of sound.

If a plane flies at exactly the speed of sound then the waves that it emits in the direction it is

flying won't be able to get away from the plane. It also means that the next sound wave

emitted will be exactly on top of the previous one, look at this picture to see what the

wavefronts would look like:

shock wave at Mach 1

Sometimes we use the speed of sound as a reference to describe the speed of the object

(aircraft in our discussion).

Definition: Mach Number

The Mach Number is the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the

surrounding medium.

Mach number is tells you how many times faster than sound the aircraft is moving.

• Mach Number < 1 : aircraft moving slower than the speed of sound

• Mach Number = 1 : aircraft moving at the speed of sound

• Mach Number > 1 : aircraft moving faster than the speed of sound

To work out the Mach Number divide the speed of the aircraft by the speed of sound.

Mach Number =

vsound

Remember: the units must be the same before you divide.

If the aircraft is moving faster than the speed of sound then the wavefronts look like this:

supersonic shock wave

If the source moves faster than the speed of sound a cone of wave fronts is created. This is

called a Mach cone. From constructive interference we know that two peaks that add together

form a larger peak. In a Mach cone many, many peaks add together to form a very large peak,

this is a sound wave so the large peak is a very very loud sound wave. This sounds like a huge

"boom" and we call the noise a sonic boom.

Worked Example 173: Mach Speed I

Question: An aircraft flies at 1300 km · h−1 and the speed of sound in air is

340 m · s−1. What is the Mach Number of the aircraft?

CHAPTER 26. 2D AND 3D WAVEFRONTS - GRADE 12 26.6
We know we are dealing with Mach Number. We are given the speed of sound in
air, 340 m · s−1, and the speed of the aircraft, 1300 km · h−1. The speed of the
aircraft is in different units to the speed of sound so we need to convert the units:
1300km · h−1 = 1300km · h−1
1300km · h−1 = 1300× 1000m
3600s
1300km · h−1 = 361.1 m · s−1
Step 2 : Applicable principles
We know that there is a relationship between the Mach Number, the speed of
sound and the speed of the aircraft:

Mach Number =
vsound
We can use this relationship to find the Mach Number.
Step 3 : Substitution

Mach Number = 1.06
The Mach Number is 1.06.

A sonic boom is the sound heard by an observer as a shockwave passes.

In this exercise we will determine the Mach Number for the different aircraft in
the table mentioned above. To help you get started we have calculated the Mach
Number for the Concord with a speed of sound vsound = 340 ms
