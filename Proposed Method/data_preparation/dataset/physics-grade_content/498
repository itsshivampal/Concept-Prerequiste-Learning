Essay: How a Pilot Uses Vectors

How an air traffic controller uses radar

How sonar is used for fishing

Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science degree (with honours) in Mechanical

Engineering from the University of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design

project he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass re-enforced

plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging, Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a

subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He

currently lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology Engineering as a

mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and integrity of equipment installed during projects.

Pressure and Forces

In the mining industry, the roof (hangingwall) tends to drop as the face of the tunnel (stope) is

excavated for rock containing gold.

As one can imagine, a roof falling on one's head is not a nice prospect! Therefore the roof

needs to be supported.

Roof Face

The roof is not one big uniform chunk of rock. Rather it is broken up into smaller chunks. It is

assumed that the biggest chunk of rock in the roof has a mass of less than 20 000 kgs therefore

each support has to be designed to resist a force related to that mass. The strength of the

material (either wood or steel) making up the support is taken into account when working out

the minimum required size and thickness of the parts to withstand the force of the roof.

Roof Face

Supports

Sometimes the design of the support is such that the support needs to withstand the rock mass

without the force breaking the roof..

Therefore hydraulic supports (hydro = water) use the principles of force and pressure such that

as a force is exerted on the support, the water pressure increases. A pressure relief valve then

squirts out water when the pressure (and thus the force) gets too large. Imagine a very large,

modified doctor's syringe.

In the petrochemical industry, there are many vessels and pipes that are under high pressures.

A vessel is a containment unit (Imagine a pot without handles, that has the lid welded to the

pot that would be a small vessel) where chemicals mix and react to form other chemicals,

amongst other uses.

End Product

Chemical

The end product chemicals are sold to companies that use these chemicals to make shampoo,

dishwashing liquid, plastic containers, fertilizer, etc. Anyway, some of these chemical reactions

require high temperatures and pressures in order to work. These pressures result in forces being

applied to the insides of the vessels and pipes. Therefore the minimum thickness of the pipe

and vessels walls must be determined using calculations, to withstand these forces. These

calculations take into account the strength of the material (typically steel, plastic or

composite), the diameter and of course the pressure inside the equipment. Let examine the

concepts of force and pressure in further detail.

GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.2, November 2002
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
changing it is not allowed.
PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must
themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which
is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free
software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the
same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed
by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under
the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion
of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that
deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
677
APPENDIX A. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of
historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being
those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or
Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A
Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a
format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to
text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or
absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup,
Texinfo input format, LATEX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD and
standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as
are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near
the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is
precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this
License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by
reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice
saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section A.
678
APPENDIX A. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly
display copies.
COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the
Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must
present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as
they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first
ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you
must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies
in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before
redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
updated version of the Document.
MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of
sections A and A above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you
must do these things in the Modified Version:
1. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
2. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.
3. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
publisher.
4. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
5. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
copyright notices.

679

APPENDIX A. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

6. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public

permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form

shown in the Addendum below.

7. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts

given in the Document's license notice.

8. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

9. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating

at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on

the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one

stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,

then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

10. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a

Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the

Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History"

section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four

years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to

gives permission.

11. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the

section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor

acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

12. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their

titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

13. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the

Modified Version.

14. Do not re-title any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title

with any Invariant Section.

15. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as

Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your

option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the

list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct

from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements

of your Modified Version by various parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the

text has been approved by an organisation as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25

words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.

Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or

through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text

for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you

are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit

permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use

their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the

terms defined in section A above for modified versions, provided that you include in the
