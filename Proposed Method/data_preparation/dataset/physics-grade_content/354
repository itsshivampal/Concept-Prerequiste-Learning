21.4.2 Inelastic Collisions

Definition: Inelastic Collisions

An inelastic collision is a collision in which total momentum is conserved but total kinetic

energy is not conserved. The kinetic energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.

So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the

total kinetic energy before and after the inelastic collision is different. Of course this does not

mean that total energy has not been conserved, rather the energy has been transformed into

another type of energy.

As a rule of thumb, inelastic collisions happen when the colliding objects are distorted in some

way. Usually they change their shape. The modification of the shape of an object requires

energy and this is where the "missing" kinetic energy goes. A classic example of an inelastic

collision is a motor car accident. The cars change shape and there is a noticeable change in the

kinetic energy of the cars before and after the collision. This energy was used to bend the

metal and deform the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in Figure 21.7.

Figure 21.7: Asteroid moving towards the Moon.

An asteroid is moving through space towards the Moon. Before the asteroid crashes into the

Moon, the total momentum of the system is:

pi = pim + pia

The total kinetic energy of the system is:

KEi = KEim +KEia

When the asteroid collides inelastically with the Moon, its kinetic energy is transformed

mostly into heat energy. If this heat energy is large enough, it can cause the asteroid and the

area of the Moon's surface that it hits, to melt into liquid rock! From the force of impact of

the asteroid, the molten rock flows outwards to form a crater on the Moon.

After the collision, the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since

this collision is inelastic, (and you can see that a change in the shape of objects has taken

place!), total kinetic energy is not the same as before the collision.

Momentum is conserved:

pi = pf

But the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved:

KEi 6= KEf

• mass of car 1, m1 = 500 kg
• mass of car 2, m2 = 500 kg
• initial velocity of car 1, vi1 = 0 m·s−1
• initial velocity of car 2, vi2 = 2 m·s−1to the left
• the collision is inelastic
All quantities are in SI units. We are required to determine the final velocity of the
resulting mass, vf .
Since the collision is inelastic, we know that
• momentum is conserved, m1vi1 +m2vi2 = m1vf1 + m2vf2
• kinetic energy is not conserved
Step 3 : Choose a frame of reference
Choose to the left as positive.
Step 4 : Solve problem
So we must use conservation of momentum to solve this problem.
pi = pf
pi1 + pi2 = pf
m1vi1 + m2vi2 = (m1 +m2)vf
(500)(0) + (500)(2) = (500 + 500)vf
1000 = 1000vf
vf = 1 m · s−1
Therefore, the final velocity of the resulting mass of cars is 1 m·s−1to the left.

Answer
Step 1 : Analyse the problem
This is an inelastic collision where momentum is conserved.
The momentum before = the momentum after.
The momentum after can be calculated by drawing a vector diagram.
Step 2 : Calculate the momentum before the collision
p1(before) = m1vi1 = (0,2)(3) = 0,6 kg ·m·s−1east
p2(before) = m2vi2 = (0,2)(4) = 0,8 kg ·m·s−1south
Step 3 : Calculate the momentum after the collision.
Here we need to draw a diagram:
0,6
θ
p1+2(after)
0,8
√
p1+2(after) = (0,8)2 + (0,6)2
= 1
Step 4 : Calculate the final velocity
First we have to find the direction of the final momentum:
0,8
tan θ =
0,6
θ = 53,13◦
Now we have to find the magnitude of the final velocity:
p1+2 = m1+2vf
1 = (0,2 + 0,2)vf
vf = 2,5m · s−1E53,13◦S

football field. The nucleus of that atom would be about the size of a tiny seed in
the middle of the field. From this analogy, you can see that atomic nuclei are very
small objects by human standards. They are roughly 10−15 meters in diameter -
one-hundred thousand times smaller than a typical atom. These nuclei cannot be

protons or electrons) at very high energies, one hopes to learn about what they are

pessimistic, with sufficient mathematical models and experimental precision,

subatomic collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the forces at work

and also about the sub-structure of such systems.

The experiments are in the category of "high energy physics" (also known as

"subatomic" physics). The primary tool of scientific exploration in these

experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very, very small

subatomic objects such as nuclei. As a general rule, the higher the energy of the

collisions, the more detail of the original system you are able to resolve. These

experiments are operated at laboratories such as CERN, SLAC, BNL, and Fermilab,

just to name a few. The giant machines that perform the collisions are roughly the

size of towns. For example, the RHIC collider at BNL is a ring about 1 km in

diameter and can be seen from space. The newest machine currently being built,

the LHC at CERN, is a ring 9 km in diameter!

1. What are isotopes? (2)

2. What are atoms made up of? (3)

3. Why do you think protons are used in the experiments and not atoms like

carbon? (2)

4. Why do you think it is necessary to find out what atoms are made up of and

how they behave during collisions? (2)

5. Two protons (mass 1,67× 10−27 kg) collide and somehow stick together after

the collision. If each proton travelled with an initial velocity of

5,00× 107 m · s−1 and they collided at an angle of 90◦, what is the velocity of

the combination after the collision. (9)
