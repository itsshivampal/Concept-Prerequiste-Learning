Chapter 17

Electrostatics - Grade 11

17.1 Introduction

In Grade 10, you learnt about the force between charges. In this chapter you will learn exactly

how to determine this force and about a basic law of electrostatics.

17.2 Forces between charges - Coulomb's Law

Like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. If the charges are at

rest then the force between them is known as the electrostatic force. The electrostatic force

between charges increases when the magnitude of the charges increases or the distance

between the charges decreases.

The electrostatic force was first studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through

his observations he was able to show that the electrostatic force between two point-like charges

is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. He also discovered

that the force is proportional to the product of the charges on the two objects.

F ∝ Q1Q2 ,

r2

where Q1 is the charge on the one point-like object, Q2 is the charge on the second, and r is

the distance between the two. The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point-like

charges is given by Coulomb's Law.

Definition: Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's Law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point

charges is directly proportional to the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional

to the square of the distance between the charges.

Q1Q2

F = k

r2

and the proportionality constant k is called the electrostatic constant and has the value:

k = 8,99× 109N ·m2 ·C−2.

Extension: Similarity of Coulomb's Law to the Newton's Universal Law of

Gravitation.

Notice how similar Coulomb's Law is to the form of Newton's Universal Law of

Gravitation between two point-like particles:
