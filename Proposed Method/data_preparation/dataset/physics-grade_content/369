22.3.2 Fracture, creep and fatigue

Some materials are neither plastic nor elastic. These substances will break or fracture when a

large enough force is applied to them. The brittle glass we mentioned earlier is an example.

Creep occurs when a material deforms over a long period of time because of an applied force.

An example of creep is the bending of a shelf over time when a heavy object is put on it. Creep

may eventually lead to the material fracturing. The application of heat may lead to an increase

in creep in a material.

Fatigue is similar to creep. The difference between the two is that fatigue results from the force

being applied and then removed repeatedly over a period of time. With metals this results in

failure because of metal fatigue.

• Fracture is an abrupt breaking of the material.

• Creep is a slow deformation process due to a continuous force over a long time.

• Fatigue is weakening of the material due to short forces acting many many times.

Exercise: Elasticity, plasticity, fracture and creep

1. List the similarities and differences between elastic and plastic deformation.

2. List the similarities and differences between creep and fracture as modes of

failure in material.

A Calculate the spring constant for the spring.

B Determine the extension of the spring if a load of 0,8 N is applied to it.

22.3 Elasticity, plasticity, fracture, creep

22.3.1 Elasticity and plasticity

Materials are classified as plastic or elastic depending on how they respond to an applied force.

It is important to note that plastic substances are not necessarily a type of plastic (polymer)

they only behave like plastic. Think of them as being like plastic which you will be familiar with.

A rubber band is a material that has elasticity. It returns to its original shape after an applied

force is removed, providing that the material is not stretched beyond its elastic limit.

Plasticine is an example of a material that is plastic. If you flatten a ball of plasticine, it will

stay flat. A plastic material does not return to its original shape after an applied force is

removed.

• Elastic materials return to their original shape.

• Plastic materials deform easily and do not return to their original shape.
