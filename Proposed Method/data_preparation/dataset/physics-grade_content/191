12.2.2 Examples of Forces in Physics

Most of Physics revolves around forces. Although there are many different forces, all are handled

in the same way. All forces in Physics can be put into one of four groups. These are gravitational

forces, electromagnetic forces, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. You will mostly come

across gravitational or electromagnetic forces at school.

Gravitational Forces

Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you

throw a ball in the air, its mass and the Earth's mass attract each other, which leads to a force

between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth, and the Earth accelerates towards the ball.

The movement of the Earth towards the ball is, however, so small that you couldn't possibly

measure it.

Electromagnetic Forces

Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are electromagnetic in origin. They

have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces

were different things. After much work and experimentation, it has been realised that they are

actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory.

Electric or Electrostatic Forces

If we have objects carrying electrical charge, which are not moving, then we are dealing with

electrostatic forces (Coulomb's Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may

seem strange, since gravity is obviously very powerful, and holding a balloon to the wall seems to

be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done, but if we think about it: for gravity

to be detectable, we need to have a very large mass nearby. But a balloon rubbed in someone's

hair can stick to a wall with a force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravity-with just

the charges in the balloon and the wall!

Magnetic Forces

The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the

interaction between moving charges as opposed to the fixed charges involved in Coulomb's Law.

Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses,car engines and computer

data storage. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them

around sites.

Friction

According to Newton's First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving

without a force acting on it will keep on moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table stop?

The answer is friction. Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom

of a box with the molecules on a table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence

friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. Later in this chapter we will discuss

frictional forces a little more.

Drag Forces

This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium like an aeroplane flying

through air. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and

because of this the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you

move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports

car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from

high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way

to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show, the greater the

drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.

Itneterreessttinigng There is a popular story that while Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple

FFacctt tree, an apple fell on his head, and he suddenly thought of the Universal Law of

Gravitation. Coincidently, the weight of a small apple is approximately 1 N.

Itneterreessttinigng Force was first described by Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC - 212 BC).

FFacctt Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, physicist and

engineer. He was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of the city, despite

orders from the Roman general, Marcellus, that he was not to be harmed.

This chapter will often refer to the resultant force acting on an object. The resultant force is

simply the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object. It is very important to remember

that all the forces must be acting on the same object. The resultant force is the force that has

the same effect as all the other forces added together.
