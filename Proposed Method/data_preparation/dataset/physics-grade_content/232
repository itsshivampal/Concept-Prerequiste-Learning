13.2.1 Converging Lenses

We will only discuss double convex converging lenses as shown in Figure 13.4. Converging lenses

are thinner on the outside and thicker on the inside.

Figure 13.4: A double convex lens is a converging lens.

Figure 13.5 shows a convex lens. Light rays traveling through a convex lens are bent towards

the principal axis. For this reason, convex lenses are called converging lenses.

Principal axis

F1 O F2

Figure 13.5: Light rays bend towards each other or converge when they travel through a convex

lens. F1 and F2 are the foci of the lens.

The type of images created by a convex lens is dependent on the position of the object. We will

329

13.2 CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS - GRADE 11

examine the following cases:

1. the object is placed at a distance greater than 2f from the lens

2. the object is placed at a distance equal to 2f from the lens

3. the object is placed at a distance between 2f and f from the lens

4. the object is placed at a distance less than f from the lens

We examine the properties of the image in each of these cases by drawing ray diagrams. We can

find the image by tracing the path of three light rays through the lens. Any two of these rays

will show us the location of the image. You can use the third ray to check the location.

Activity :: Experiment : Lenses A

Aim:

To determine the focal length of a convex lens.

Method:

1. Using a distant object from outside, adjust the position of the convex lens so

that it gives the smallest possible focus on a sheet of paper that is held parallel

to the lens.

2. Measure the distance between the lens and the sheet of paper as accurately as

possible.

Results:

The focal length of the lens is cm

Activity :: Experiment : Lenses B

Aim:

To investigate the position, size and nature of the image formed by a convex lens.

Method:

1. Set up the candle, the lens from Experiment Lenses A in its holder and the

screen in a straight line on the metre rule. Make sure the lens holder is on the

50 cm mark.

From your knowledge of the focal length of your lens, note where f and 2f are

on both sides of the lens.

2. Using the position indicated on the table below, start with the candle at a

position that is greater than 2f and adjust the position of the screen until a

sharp focused image is obtained. Note that there are two positions for which

a sharp focused image will not be obtained on the screen. When this is so,

remove the screen and look at the candle through the lens.

Drawing Ray Diagrams for Converging Lenses
The three rays are labelled R1, R2 and R3. The ray diagrams that follow will use this naming
convention.
1. The first ray (R1) travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis. This
ray is bent by the lens and travels through the focal point.
2. Any ray travelling parallel to the principal axis is bent through the focal point.
332
CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS - GRADE 11 13.2
3. If a light ray passes through a focal point before it enters the lens, then it will leave the
lens parallel to the principal axis. The second ray (R2) is therefore drawn to pass through
the focal point before it enters the lens.
4. A ray that travels through the centre of the lens does not change direction. The third ray
(R3) is drawn through the centre of the lens.
5. The point where all three of the rays (R1, R2 and R3) intersect is the image of the point
where they all started. The image will form at this point.
Important: In ray diagrams, lenses are drawn like this:
Convex lens: Concave lens:

Figure 13.7: An object is placed at a distance greater than 2f away from the converging lens.
Three rays are drawn to locate the image, which is real, smaller than the object and inverted.
We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object
to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal
point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the
lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change
direction. The point where R1, R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all
started.
The image of an object placed at a distance greater than 2f from the lens is upside down or
inverted. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object, above the principal
axis, after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called a real
image because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the light
rays directly from the image back to the object.
The image is also smaller than the object and is located closer to the lens than the object.
Important: In reality, light rays come from all points along the length of the object. In ray
diagrams we only draw three rays (all starting at the top of the object) to keep the diagram
clear and simple.

We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object
to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal
point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the
lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change
direction. The point where R1, R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all

The image of an object placed at a distance between 2f and f from the lens is upside down
or inverted. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object, above the principal
axis, after passing through the lens end up below the principal axis. The image is called a real

rays directly from the image back to the object.

Figure 13.10: An object is placed at a distance less than f away from the converging lens. Three
rays are drawn to locate the image, which is virtual, larger than the object and upright.
We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. R1 travels from the object
to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal
point. R2 passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the
lens parallel to the principal axis. R3 travels through the center of the lens and does not change
direction. The point where R1, R2 and R3 intersect is the image of the point where they all
started.
The image of an object placed at a distance less than f from the lens is upright. The image is
called a virtual image because it is on the same side of the lens as the object and you cannot
trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object.
The image is larger than the object and is located further away from the lens than the object.
Extension: The thin lens equation and magnification
The Thin Lens Equation
We can find the position of the image of a lens mathematically as there is
mathematical relation between the object distance, image distance, and focal length.
The equation is:
1 1 1
= +
f do di
where f is the focal length, do is the object distance and di is the image distance.
The object distance do is the distance from the object to the lens. do is positive
if the object is on the same side of the lens as the light rays enter the lens. This
335
13.2 CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS - GRADE 11
should make sense: we expect the light rays to travel from the object to the lens.
The image distance di is the distance from the lens to the image. Unlike mirrors,
which reflect light back, lenses refract light through them. We expect to find the
image on the same side of the lens as the light leaves the lens. If this is the case,
then di is positive and the image is real (see Figure 13.9). Sometimes the image will
be on the same side of the lens as the light rays enter the lens. Then di is negative
and the image is virtual (Figure 13.10). If we know any two of the three quantities
above, then we can use the Thin Lens Equation to solve for the third quantity.
Magnification
It is possible to calculate the magnification of an image. The magnification is
how much bigger or smaller the image is than the object.
m = − di
do
where m is the magnification, do is the object distance and di is the image distance.
If di and do are both positive, the magnification is negative. This means the
image is inverted, or upside down. If di is negative and do is positive, then the
image is not inverted, or right side up. If the absolute value of the magnification is
greater than one, the image is larger than the object. For example, a magnification
of -2 means the image is inverted and twice as big as the object.
Worked Example 97: Using the lens equation

Question: An object is placed 5 cm to the left of a converging lens which has a
focal length of 2,5 cm.

Step 2 : Draw the three rays
• R1 goes from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis, through the
lens and through the focal point F2 on the other side of the lens.
• R2 goes from the top of the object through the focal point F1, through the
lens and out parallel to the principal axis.
• R3 goes from the top of the object through the optical centre with its direction
unchanged.

Step 4 : Measure the distance between the lens and the image
The image is 5 cm away from the lens, on the opposite side of the lens to the object.
Step 5 : Is the image virtual or real?
Since the image is on the opposite side of the lens to the object, the image is real.
Worked Example 99: Locating the image position of a convex lens: II
Question: An object, 1 cm high, is placed 2 cm to the left of a converging lens
which has a focal length of 3,0 cm. The image is found also on the left side of the
lens.

2. What is the position and height of the image?
Answer
Step 1 : Draw the picture to set up the problem
Draw the lens, principal axis, focal points and the object.
F2
F1 Object O
Step 2 : Draw the three rays to locate image
• R1 goes from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis, through the
lens and through the focal point F2 on the other side of the lens.
• R2 is the light ray which should go through the focal point F1 but the object
is placed after the focal point! This is not a problem, just trace the line from
the focal point F1, through the top of the object, to the lens. This ray then
leaves the lens parallel to the principal axis.
• R3 goes from the top of the object through the optical centre with its direction
unchanged.
338
CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS - GRADE 11 13.2
• Do not write R1, R2 and R3 on your diagram, otherwise it becomes too clut-
tered.
• Since the rays do not intersect on the right side of the lens, we need to trace
them backwards to find the place where they do come together (these are the
light gray lines). Again, this is the position of the image.

Step 6 : Is image real or virtual?
Since the image is on the same side of the lens as the object, the image is virtual.

lens? Hint: Draw the picture.
