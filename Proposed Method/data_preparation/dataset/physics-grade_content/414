26.5 Diffraction

One of the most interesting, and also very useful, properties of waves is diffraction.

Definition: Diffraction

Diffraction is the ability of a wave to spread out in wavefronts as the wave passes through

a small aperture or around a sharp edge.

Extension: Diffraction

Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with wave propagation, such

as the bending, spreading and interference of waves emerging from an aperture. It

occurs with any type of wave, including sound waves, water waves, electromagnetic

waves such as light and radio waves. While diffraction always occurs, its effects are

generally only noticeable for waves where the wavelength is on the order of the

feature size of the diffracting objects or apertures.

For example, if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and a sound is produced in a

remote corner of one of them, a person in the other room will hear the sound as if it originated

at the doorway.

As far as the second room is concerned, the vibrating air in the doorway is the source of the

sound. The same is true of light passing the edge of an obstacle, but this is not as easily

observed because of the short wavelength of visible light.

This means that when waves move through small holes they appear to bend around the sides

because there are not enough points on the wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This

is bending round the sides we call diffraction.

Extension: Diffraction

Diffraction effects are more clear for water waves with longer wavelengths.

Diffraction can be demonstrated by placing small barriers and obstacles in a ripple

tank and observing the path of the water waves as they encounter the obstacles.

The waves are seen to pass around the barrier into the regions behind it;

subsequently the water behind the barrier is disturbed. The amount of diffraction

(the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing wavelength and decreases

with decreasing wavelength. In fact, when the wavelength of the waves are smaller

than the obstacle, no noticeable diffraction occurs.

Activity :: Experiment : Diffraction

Water waves in a ripple tank can be used to demonstrate diffraction and

interference.

When the grey lines cross other grey lines there are two troughs are in the same place at the

same time so we will have constructive interference where the two troughs add together to

form a bigger trough.

In the case where a grey line crosses a black line we are seeing a trough and peak in the same

place. These will cancel each other out and the medium will have no displacement at that

point.

• black line + black line = peak + peak = constructive interference

• grey line + grey line = trough + trough = constructive interference

• black line + grey line = grey line + black line = peak + trough = trough + peak =

destructive interference

On half the picture below, we have marked the constructive interference with a solid black

diamond and the destructive interference with a hollow diamond.

To see if you understand it, cover up the half we have marked with diamonds and try to work

out which points are constructive and destructive on the other half of the picture. The two

halves are mirror images of each other so you can check yourself.
