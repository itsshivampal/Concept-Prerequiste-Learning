7.3.3 Types of Reflection

The Law of Reflection is true for any surface. Does this mean that when parallel rays approach

a surface, the reflected rays will also be parallel? This depends on the texture of the reflecting

surface.

Figure 7.8: Specular and diffuse reflection.

Specular Reflection

Figure 7.8(a) shows a surface that is flat and even. Parallel incident light rays hit the smooth

surface and parallel reflected light rays leave the surface. This type of reflection is called specular

reflection. Specular reflection occurs when rays are reflected from a smooth, shiny surface. The

normal to the surface is the same at every point on the surface. Parallel incident rays become

parallel reflected rays. When you look in a mirror, the image you see is formed by specular

reflection.

Diffuse Reflection

Figure 7.8(b) shows a surface with bumps and curves. When multiple rays hit this uneven

surface, diffuse reflection occurs. The incident rays are parallel but the reflected rays are not.

Each point on the surface has a different normal. This means the angle of incidence is different

at each point. Then according to the Law of Reflection, each angle of reflection is different.

Diffuse reflection occurs when light rays are reflected from bumpy surfaces. You can still see a

reflection as long as the surface is not too bumpy. Diffuse reflection enables us to see all objects

that are not sources of light.

Activity :: Experiment : Specular and Diffuse Reflection

A bouncing ball can be used to demonstrate the basic difference between specular

and diffuse reflection.

Aim:

To demonstrate and compare specular and diffuse reflection.

Apparatus:

You will need:

1. a small ball (a tennis ball or a table tennis ball is perfect)

2. a smooth surface, like the floor inside the classroom

3. a very rough surface, like a rocky piece of ground

Method:

1. Bounce the ball on the smooth floor and observe what happens.

2. Bounce the ball on the rough ground floor and observe what happens.

3. What do you observe?

4. What is the difference between the two surfaces?

Conclusions:

You should have seen that the ball bounces (is reflected off the floor) in a predictable

manner off the smooth floor, but bounces unpredictably on the rough ground.

The ball can be seen to be a ray of light and the floor or ground is the reflecting

surface. For specular reflection (smooth surface), the ball bounces predictably. For

diffuse reflection (rough surface), the ball bounces unpredictably.
