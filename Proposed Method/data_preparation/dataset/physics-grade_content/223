12.6.1 Torque

This chapter has dealt with forces and how they lead to motion in a straight line. In this section,

we examine how forces lead to rotational motion.

When an object is fixed or supported at one point and a force acts on it a distance away from

the support, it tends to make the object turn. The moment of force or torque (symbol, τ read

tau) is defined as the product of the distance from the support or pivot (r) and the component

of force perpendicular to the object, F⊥.

τ = F⊥ · r (12.9)

Torque can be seen as a rotational force. The unit of torque is N·m and torque is a vector

quantity. Some examples of where torque arises are shown in Figures 12.17, 12.18 and 12.19.

For example in Figure 12.19, if a force F of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the spanner at a

distance r of 0,3 m from the center of the bolt, then the torque applied to the bolt is:

τ = F⊥ · r

= (10 N)(0,3m)

= 3N ·m

If the force of 10 N is now applied at a distance of 0,15 m from the centre of the bolt, then the

torque is:

τ = F⊥ · r

= (10 N)(0,15m)

= 1,5N ·m

This shows that there is less torque when the force is applied closer to the bolt than further

away.

Important: Loosening a bolt

If you are trying to loosen (or tighten) a bolt, apply the force on the spanner further away from

the bolt, as this results in a greater torque to the bolt making it easier to loosen.

Important: Any component of a force exerted parallel to an object will not cause the object

to turn. Only perpendicular components cause turning.

Important: Torques

The direction of a torque is either clockwise or anticlockwise. When torques are added, choose

one direction as positive and the opposite direction as negative. If equal clockwise and anti-

clockwise torques are applied to an object, they will cancel out and there will be no net turning

effect.

Worked Example 95: Merry-go-round

Question: Several children are playing in the park. One child pushes the merry-go-

round with a force of 50 N. The diameter of the merry-go-round is 3,0 m. What

torque does the child apply if the force is applied perpendicularly at point A?

Answer
Step 1 : Identify what has been given
The following has been given:
• the force applied, F = 50 N
• the diameter of the merry-go-round, 2r = 3 m, therefore r = 1,5 m.
The quantities are in SI units.
Step 2 : Decide how to approach the problem
We are required to determine the torque applied to the merry-go-round. We can do
this by using:
τ = F⊥ · r
We are given F⊥ and we are given the diameter of the merry-go-round. Therefore,
r = 1,5 m.
Step 3 : Solve the problem
τ = F⊥ · r
= (50N)(1,5m)
= 75N ·m
Step 4 : Write the final answer
75 N ·m of torque is applied to the merry-go-round.

Question: Kevin is helping his dad replace the flat tyre on the car. Kevin has been
asked to undo all the wheel nuts. Kevin holds the spanner at the same distance for
all nuts, but applies the force at two angles (90◦ and 60◦). If Kevin applies a force
of 60 N, at a distance of 0,3 m away from the nut, which angle is the best to use?

we must find which angle gives the higher torque. We can use

applied.

Step 3 : Solve the problem for θ = 90◦

F⊥ = F

τ = F⊥ · r

= (60N)(0,3m)

= 18N ·m

Step 4 : Solve the problem for θ = 60◦

The torque from the perpendicular force is greater than the torque from the force

applied at 60◦. Therefore, the best angle is 90◦.
