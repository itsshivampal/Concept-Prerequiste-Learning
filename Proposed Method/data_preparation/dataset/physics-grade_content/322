19.3.2 Use of Ohm's Law in series and parallel Circuits

Worked Example 127: Ohm's Law

Question: Calculate the current (I) in this circuit if the resistors are both ohmic in

nature.

Answer

R1=2 Ω

R2=4 Ω

V =12 V

I

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We are required to calculate the current flowing in the circuit.

Step 2 : Determine how to approach the problem

Since the resistors are Ohmic in nature, we can use Ohm's Law. There are however

two resistors in the circuit and we need to find the total resistance.

Step 3 : Find total resistance in circuit

Since the resistors are connected in series, the total resistance R is:

R = R1 +R2

Therefore,

R = 2 + 4 = 6 Ω

Step 4 : Apply Ohm's Law

V = R · I

R2=?

V =1,5 V

I=0,25 A

Step 7 : Determine how to approach the problem.

We can use Ohm's Law to find the total resistance R in the circuit, and then

calculate the unknown resistance using:

R = R1 +R2

in a series circuit.

Step 8 : Find the total resistance

and that

R1 = 1Ω

Since

R = R1 +R2

R2 = R−R1

Therefore,

R2 = 5Ω
