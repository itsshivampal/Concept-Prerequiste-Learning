14.8 CHAPTER 14. LONGITUDINAL WAVES - GRADE 11

5. The relationship between wave speed (v), frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) is given by

v = fλ.

6. Graphs of position vs time, velocity vs time and acceleration vs time can be drawn and

are summarised in figures

7. Sound waves are examples of longitudinal waves. The speed of sound depends on the

medium, temperature and pressure. Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids,

and faster in liquids than in gases. Sound waves also travel faster at higher temperatures

and higher pressures.

14.8 Exercises - Longitudinal Waves

1. Which of the following is not a longitudinal wave?

1.1 seismic P-wave

1.2 light

1.3 sound

1.4 ultrasound

2. Which of the following media can sound not travel through?

2.1 solid

2.2 liquid

2.3 gas

2.4 vacuum

3. Select a word from Column B that best fits the description in Column A:

Column A Column B

waves in the air caused by vibrations longitudinal waves

waves that move in one direction, but medium moves in another frequency

waves and medium that move in the same direction white noise

the distance between one wave and the next wave amplitude

how often a single wave goes by sound waves

difference between high points and low points of waves standing waves

the distance a wave covers per time interval transverse waves

the time taken for one wavelength to pass a point wavelength

music

sounds

wave speed

4. A longitudinal wave has a crest to crest distance of 10 m. It takes the wave 5 s to pass a

point.

4.1 What is the wavelength of the longitudinal wave?

4.2 What is the speed of the wave?

5. A flute produces a musical sound travelling at a speed of 320 m.s−1. The frequency of

the note is 256 Hz. Calculate:

5.1 the period of the note

5.2 the wavelength of the note

6. A person shouts at a cliff and hears an echo from the cliff 1 s later. If the speed of sound

is 344 m·s−1, how far away is the cliff?

7. A wave travels from one medium to another and the speed of the wave decreases. What

will the effect be on the ... (write only increases, decreases or remains the same)

7.1 wavelength?

7.2 period?

Sound - Grade 11

15.1 Introduction

Now that we have studied the basics of longitudinal waves, we are ready to study sound waves

in detail.

Have you ever thought about how amazing your sense of hearing is? It is actually pretty

remarkable. There are many types of sounds: a car horn, a laughing baby, a barking dog, and

somehow your brain can sort it all out. Though it seems complicated, it is rather simple to

understand once you learn a very simple fact. Sound is a wave. So you can use everything you

know about waves to explain sound.

15.2 Characteristics of a Sound Wave

Since sound is a wave, we can relate the properties of sound to the properties of a wave. The

basic properties of sound are: pitch, loudness and tone.

Sound A

Sound B

Sound C

Figure 15.1: Pitch and loudness of sound. Sound B has a lower pitch (lower frequency) than

Sound A and is softer (smaller amplitude) than Sound C.
