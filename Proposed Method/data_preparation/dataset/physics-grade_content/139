9.9 End of chapter exercise

1. What are the two types of charge called?

2. Provide evidence for the existence of two types of charge.

3. The electrostatic force between like charges is ????? while the electrostatic force between

opposite charges is ?????.

4. I have two positively charged metal balls placed 2 m apart.

4.1 Is the electrostatic force between the balls attractive or repulsive?

4.2 If I now move the balls so that they are 1 m apart, what happens to the strength of

the electrostatic force between them?

5. I have 2 charged spheres each hanging from string as shown in the picture below.

+ +

Choose the correct answer from the options below: The spheres will

5.1 swing towards each other due to the attractive electrostatic force between them.

5.2 swing away from each other due to the attractive electrostatic force between them.

5.3 swing towards each other due to the repulsive electrostatic force between them.

5.4 swing away from each other due to the repulsive electrostatic force between them.

6. Describe how objects (insulators) can be charged by contact or rubbing.

7. You are given a perspex ruler and a piece of cloth.

7.1 How would you charge the perspex ruler?

7.2 Explain how the ruler becomes charged in terms of charge.

7.3 How does the charged ruler attract small pieces of paper?

CHAPTER 9. ELECTROSTATICS - GRADE 10 9.9

8. [IEB 2005/11 HG] An uncharged hollow metal sphere is placed on an insulating stand. A

positively charged rod is brought up to touch the hollow metal sphere at P as shown in

the diagram below. It is then moved away from the sphere.

+++

P

Where is the excess charge distributed on the sphere after the rod has been removed?

8.1 It is still located at point P where the rod touched the sphere.

8.2 It is evenly distributed over the outer surface of the hollow sphere.

8.3 It is evenly distributed over the outer and inner surfaces of the hollow sphere.

8.4 No charge remains on the hollow sphere.

9. What is the process called where molecules in an uncharged object are caused to align in

a particular direction due to an external charge?

10. Explain how an uncharged object can be attracted to a charged object. You should use

diagrams to illustrate your answer.

11. Explain how a stream of water can be attracted to a charged rod.
