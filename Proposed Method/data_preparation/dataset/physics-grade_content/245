Longitudinal Waves - Grade 11

14.1 Introduction

In Grade 10 we studied pulses and waves. We looked at transverse waves more closely. In this

chapter we look at another type of wave called longitudinal waves. In transverse waves, the

motion of the particles in the medium were perpendicular to the direction of the wave. In

longitudinal waves, the particles in the medium move parallel (in the same direction as) to the

motion of the wave. Examples of transverse waves are water waves or light waves. An example

of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave.

14.2 What is a longitudinal wave?

Definition: Longitudinal waves

A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the

direction of propagation of the wave.

When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the

particles of the medium and the motion of the save itself. We will do the same for longitudinal

waves.

The question is how do we construct such a wave?

To create a transverse wave, we flick the end of for example a rope up and down. The particles

move up and down and return to their equilibrium position. The wave moves from left to right

and will be displaced.

flick rope up and down at one end

A longitudinal wave is seen best in a spring that is hung from a ceiling. Do the following

investigation to find out more about longitudinal waves.
