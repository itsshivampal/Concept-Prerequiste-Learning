25.4.1 Colour of opaque objects

Objects which you cannot see through (i.e. they are not transparent) are called opaque.

Examples of some opaque objects are metals, wood and bricks. The colour of an opaque object

is determined by the colours (therefore frequencies) of light which it reflects. For example,

when white light strikes a blue opaque object such as a ruler, the ruler will absorb all

frequencies of light except blue, which will be reflected. The reflected blue light is the light

which makes it into our eyes and therefore the object will appear blue.

Opaque objects which appear white do not absorb any light. They reflect all the frequencies.

Black opaque objects absorb all frequencies of light. They do not reflect at all and therefore

appear to have no colour.

Worked Example 163: Colour of Opaque Objects

Question: If we shine white light on a sheet of paper that can only reflect green

light, what is the colour of the paper?

Answer

Since the colour of an object is determined by that frequency of light that is

reflected, the sheet of paper will appear green, as this is the only frequency that is

reflected. All the other frequencies are absorbed by the paper.

Worked Example 164: Colour of an opaque object II

Question: The cover of a book appears to have a magenta colour. What colours

of light does it reflect and what colours does it absorb?

Answer

We know that magenta is a combination of red and blue primary colours of light.

Therefore the object must be reflecting blue and red light and absorb green.
