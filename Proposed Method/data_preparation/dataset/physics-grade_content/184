11.8.2 Summary

1. A scalar is a physical quantity with magnitude only.

2. A vector is a physical quantity with magnitude and direction.

3. Vectors are drawn as arrows where the length of the arrow indicates the magnitude and

the arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector.

4. The direction of a vector can be indicated by referring to another vector or a fixed point

(eg. 30◦ from the river bank); using a compass (eg. N 30◦ W); or bearing (eg. 053◦).

5. Vectors can be added using the head-to-tail method, the parallelogram method or the

component method.

6. The resultant of a vector is the single vector whose effect is the same as the individual

vectors acting together.

The dot product is most similar to regular multiplication between scalars. To

take the dot product of two vectors, you just multiply their magnitudes to get out a

scalar answer. The maths definition of the dot product is:

~a •~b = |~a| · |~b| cos θ

Take two vectors ~a and ~b:

b

a

You can draw in the component of ~b that is parallel to ~a:

b

a θ

b cos θ

In this way we can arrive at the definition of the dot product. You find how much

of ~b is lined up with ~a by finding the component of ~b parallel to ~a. Then multiply

the magnitude of that component, |~b| cos θ, with the magnitude of ~a to get a scalar.

The second type of multiplication is more subtle and uses the directions of the

vectors in a more complicated way to get another vector as the answer. The maths

definition of the cross product is:

~a×~b = |~a||~b| sin θ

This gives the magnitude of the answer, but we still need to find the direction of

the resultant vector. We do this by applying the right hand rule.

Method: Right Hand Rule

1. Using your right hand: a

2. Point your index finger in the direction of ~a. θ

a×b

b

3. Point the middle finger in the direction of ~b.

4. Your thumb will show the direction of ~a×~b.
