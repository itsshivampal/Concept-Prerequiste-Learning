31.5.2 A simple laser

A laser consists of a number of different parts that work together to create the laser beam.

Figure 31.10 shows the different parts of the laser, while Figure 31.11 shows how they create

the laser beam.

The basis of the laser is the laser material. The laser material consists of the atoms that are

used to create the laser beam. Many different materials can be used as laser material, and their

energy levels determine the characteristics of the laser. Some examples of different lasers are

shown in Table 31.3. The laser material is contained in the optical cavity.

Before the laser is turned on, all the atoms in the laser material are in their ground state. The

first step in creating a laser beam is to add energy to the laser material to raise most of the

electrons into an excited metastable state. This is called pumping the laser.

The creation of the laser beam starts through the process of spontaneous emission, shown in

Figure 31.8. An electron drops down to the ground state and emits a photon with energy equal

to the energy difference of the two energy levels. This laser photon is the beginning of the laser

An excited atom decays though spontaneous emission, emitting a photon. (3) The photon

encounters another excited atom and causes it to decay through stimulated emission, creating

another photon. (4) The photons bounce back and forth through the laser medium between

the mirrors, building up more and more photons. (5) A small percentage of the photons pass

beam.

Sometimes a laser photon runs into another excited electron. Then stimulated emission occurs

and the electron drops down to the ground state and emits an additional identical photon as

shown in Figure 31.9. Since the laser material typically has a large number of atoms, one laser

photon passing through this material will rapidly cause a large number of photons just like it to

be emitted.

The optical cavity keeps the laser photons inside the laser cavity so they can build up the laser

beam. At each end is a concave mirror; one is a full mirror and one is a partial mirror. The full

mirror is totally reflective. The partial mirror transmits a small amount of the light that hits

it(less than 1%). The mirrors are carefully aligned so that photons that reflect off one mirror

become "trapped", and bounce back and forth between the mirrors many times causing more

and more stimulated emission. The photons that eventually escape through the

partially-silvered mirror become the laser beam that we see.

As the photons bounce between mirrors, they continually pass through the laser material,

stimulating those atoms to emit more photons. This creates an ever increasing beam of

photons, all with the same characteristics, all traveling in the same direction. In this way, the

optical cavity helps to amplify the original laser photons into a concentrated, intense beam of

photons.

The laser cavity also helps to narrow the frequency range of laser light emitted. The distance

between the two mirrors defines the cavity mode which only allows light of a narrow range of

frequencies to continue being reflected back and forth. Light of other frequencies damped out.

(This is just like in the chapter on the physics of music where a pipe of a certain length

corresponds to a particular wavelength of sound.) Therefore only a narrow frequency of light

can be emitted.

Itneterreessttinigng In 1953, Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and

FFacctt Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser, a device operating on similar

principles to the laser, but producing microwave rather than optical radiation.

Townes's maser was incapable of making a continuous beam. Nikolay Basov

and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the former Soviet Union worked independently and

developed a method of making a continuous beam using more than two energy

levels. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.
