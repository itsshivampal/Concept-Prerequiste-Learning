15.1 Introduction

Now that we have studied the basics of longitudinal waves, we are ready to study sound waves

in detail.

Have you ever thought about how amazing your sense of hearing is? It is actually pretty

remarkable. There are many types of sounds: a car horn, a laughing baby, a barking dog, and

somehow your brain can sort it all out. Though it seems complicated, it is rather simple to

understand once you learn a very simple fact. Sound is a wave. So you can use everything you

know about waves to explain sound.
