12.6.4 Exercise

1. Riyaad applies a force of 120 N on a spanner to undo a nut.

1.1 Calculate the moment of the force if he applies the force 0,15 m from the bolt.

1.2 The nut does not turn, so Riyaad moves his hand to the end of the spanner and

applies the same force 0,2 m away from the bolt. Now the nut begins to move.

Calculate the new moment of force. Is it bigger or smaller than before?

1.3 Once the nuts starts to turn, the moment needed to turn it is less than it was to

start it turning. It is now 20 N路m. Calculate the new moment of force that Riyaad

now needs to apply 0,2 m away from the nut.

2. Calculate the clockwise and anticlockwise moments in the figure below to see if the see-saw

is balanced.

3.1 Calculate the mechanical advantage of the lever that he is using.

3.2 What type of lever is he using? Give a reason for your answer.

3.3 If the force is applied 1 m from the pivot, calculate the distance between the pivot

and the load.

4. A crowbar is used to lift a box of weight 400 N. The box is placed 75 cm from the pivot.

A crow bar is a class 1 lever.

4.1 Why is a crowbar a class 1 lever. Draw a diagram to explain your answer.

4.2 What force F needs to be applied at a distance of 1,25 m from the pivot to balance

the crowbar?

4.3 If force F was applied at a distance of 2 m, what would the magnitude of F be?

5. A wheelbarrow is used to carry a load of 200 N. The load is 40 cm from the pivot and the

force F is applied at a distance of 1,2 m from the pivot.

5.1 What type of lever is a wheelbarrow?

5.2 Calculate the force F that needs to be applied to lift the load.

6. The bolts holding a car wheel in place is tightened to a torque of 90 N 路 m. The mechanic

has two spanners to undo the bolts, one with a length of 20 cm and one with a length of 30

cm. Which spanner should he use? Give a reason for your answer by showing calculations

and explaining them.

and the effort on the other end of bar. The mechanical advantage of this type of lever can be

increased by increasing the length of the bar. A bottle opener or wheel barrow are examples of

class 2 levers.

In class 3 levers the fulcrum is also at the end of the bar, but the effort is between the fulcrum

and the load. An example of this type of lever is the human arm.
