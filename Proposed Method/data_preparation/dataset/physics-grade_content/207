12.4 Forces between Masses

In Chapter ??, you saw that gravitational fields exert forces on masses in the field. A field is

a region of space in which an object experiences a force. The strength of a field is defined by

a field strength. For example, the gravitational field strength, g, on or near the surface of the

Earth has a value that is approximately 9,8 m·s−2.

The force exerted by a field of strength g on an object of mass m is given by:

F = m · g (12.1)

This can be re-written in terms of g as:

F

g =

m

This means that g can be understood to be a measure of force exerted per unit mass.

The force defined in Equation 12.1 is known as weight.

Objects in a gravitational field exert forces on each other without touching. The gravitational

force is an example of a non-contact force.

Gravity is a force and therefore must be described by a vector - so remember magnitude and

direction.
