24.5 End of Chapter Exercises

1. Write a definition for each of the following terms.

A Doppler Effect

B Red-shift

C Ultrasound

2. Explain how the Doppler Effect is used to determine the direction of blood flow in veins.

3. The hooter of an appoaching taxi has a frequency of 500 Hz. If the taxi is travelling at

30 m·s−1and the speed of sound is 300 m·s−1, calculate the frequency of sound that you

hear when

A the taxi is approaching you.

B the taxi passed you and is driving away.

4. A truck approaches you at an unknown speed. The sound of the trucks engine has a

frequency of 210 Hz, however you hear a frequency of 220 Hz. The speed of sound is

340 m·s−1.

A Calculate the speed of the truck.

B How will the sound change as the truck passes you? Explain this phenomenon in

terms of the wavelength and frequency of the sound.

5. A police car is driving towards a fleeing suspect. The frequency of the police car's siren is

400 Hz at v35 , where v is the speed of sound. The suspect is running away at

v

68 . What

frequency does the suspect hear?

6. A Why are ultrasound waves used in sonography and not sound waves?

B Explain how the Doppler effect is used to determine the direction of flow of blood in

veins.

25.1 Introduction

We call the light that we humans can see 'visible light'. Visible light is actually just a small

part of the large spectrum of electromagnetic radiation which you will learn more about in

Chapter 30. We can think of electromagnetic radiation and visible light as transverse waves.

We know that transverse waves can be described by their amplitude, frequency (or wavelength)

and velocity. The velocity of a wave is given by the product of its frequency and wavelength:

v = f × λ (25.1)

However, electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is special because, no matter what

the frequency, it all moves at a constant velocity (in vacuum) which is known as the speed of

light. The speed of light has the symbol c and is:

c = 3× 108 m.s−1

Since the speed of light is c, we can then say:

c = f × λ (25.2)

25.2 Colour and Light

Our eyes are sensitive to visible light over a range of wavelengths from 390 nm to 780 nm (1

nm = 1× 10−9 m). The different colours of light we see are related to specific frequencies

(and wavelengths) of visible light. The wavelengths and frequencies are listed in table 25.1.

Colour Wavelength range (nm) Frequency range (Hz)

violet 390 - 455 769 - 659 ×1012

blue 455 - 492 659 - 610 ×1012

green 492 - 577 610 - 520 ×1012

yellow 577 - 597 520 - 503 ×1012

orange 597 - 622 503 - 482 ×1012

red 622 - 780 482 - 385 ×1012

Table 25.1: Colours, wavelengths and frequencies of light in the visible spectrum.

You can see from table 25.1 that violet light has the shortest wavelengths and highest

frequencies while red light has the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies.
