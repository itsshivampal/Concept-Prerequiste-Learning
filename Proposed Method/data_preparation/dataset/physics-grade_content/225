12.6.3 Classes of levers

Class 1 levers

In a class 1 lever the fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Examples of class 1 levers are

the seesaw, crowbar and equal-arm balance. The mechanical advantage of a class 1 lever can be

increased by moving the fulcrum closer to the load.

Class 2 levers

In class 2 levers the fulcrum is at the one end of the bar, with the load closer to the fulcrum

and the effort on the other end of bar. The mechanical advantage of this type of lever can be

increased by increasing the length of the bar. A bottle opener or wheel barrow are examples of

class 2 levers.

Class 3 levers

In class 3 levers the fulcrum is also at the end of the bar, but the effort is between the fulcrum

and the load. An example of this type of lever is the human arm.

Figure 12.22: A lever is used to put in a small effort to get out a large load.

The effort is found by balancing torques.

Fload · rload = Feffort · reffort

980N · 0.5m = Feffort · 1m

980N · 0.5m

Feffort =

1m

= 490N

The mechanical advantage is:

Since mechanical advantage is a ratio, it does not have any units.

Extension: Pulleys

Pulleys change the direction of a tension force on a flexible material, e.g. a rope or

cable. In addition, pulleys can be "added together" to create mechanical advantage,

by having the flexible material looped over several pulleys in turn. More loops and

pulleys increases the mechanical advantage.
