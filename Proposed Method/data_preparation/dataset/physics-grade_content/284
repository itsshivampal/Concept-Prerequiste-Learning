17.3 Electric field around charges

We have learnt that objects that carry charge feel forces from all other charged objects. It is

useful to determine what the effect of a charge would be at every point surrounding it. To do

this we need some sort of reference. We know that the force that one charge feels due to

another depends on both charges (Q1 and Q2). How then can we talk about forces if we only

have one charge? The solution to this dilemma is to introduce a test charge. We then

determine the force that would be exerted on it if we placed it at a certain location. If we do

this for every point surrounding a charge we know what would happen if we put a test charge

at any location.

This map of what would happen at any point we call an electric field map. It is a map of the

electric field due to a charge. It tells us how large the force on a test charge would be and in

what direction the force would be. Our map consists of the lines that tell us how the test

charge would move if it were placed there.

Definition: Electric field

An electric field as a region of space in which an electric charge experiences a force. The

direction of the electric field at a point is the direction that a positive test charge would

move if placed at that point.

The only force we know is the gravitational force Fg = mg. Now we can calculate

the magnitude of T from above:

Fg (10)(10)

T = = = 115,5N.

sin(60◦) sin(60◦)

Which means that FE is:

FE = T cos(60

◦) = 115,5 · cos(60◦) = 57,75N

Step 4 :

Now that we know the magnitude of the electrostatic force between X and Y, we

can calculate their charges using Coulomb's Law. Don't forget that the magnitudes

of the charges on X and Y are the same: QX = QY. The magnitude of the

electrostatic force is

Thus the charge on X is −5.66× 10−5C.

Exercise: Electrostatic forces

1. Calculate the electrostatic force between two charges of +6nC and +1nC if

they are separated by a distance of 2mm.

2. Calculate the distance between two charges of +4nC and −3nC if the

electrostaticforce between them is 0,005N.

3. Calculate the charge on two identical spheres that are similiarly charged if they

are separated by 20cm and the electrostatic force between them is 0,06N.
