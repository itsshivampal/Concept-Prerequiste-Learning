17.4 Electrical potential energy and potential

The electrical potential energy of a charge is the energy it has because of its position relative

to other charges that it interacts with. The potential energy of a charge Q1 relative to a

charge Q2 a distance r away is calculated by:

kQ1Q2

U =

r

Worked Example 116: Electrical potential energy 1

Question: What is the electric potential energy of a 7nC charge that is 2 cm from

a 20nC?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required

We need to calculate the electric potential energy (U).

Step 2 : Determine what is given

We are given both charges and the distance between them.

Step 3 : Determine how to approach the problem

We will use the equation:

kQ1Q2

U =

r

Step 4 : Solve the problem

kQ1Q2

U =

r

(8.99× 109)(7× 10−9)(20× 10−9)

=

(0,02)

= 6,29× 10−5J
