31.1 Introduction

For centuries physicists argued about whether light was a particle or a wave. It was assumed

that light could only be one or the other, but not both.

In earlier chapters on waves (Chapters 6, 24, 25, 26) and optics (Chapters 7 and 13), you

studied how light or other electromagnetic radiation propagates like a wave. The wave nature

of light of was demonstrated by the propagation of light in examples such as diffraction,

interference, and polarisation of light.

You also saw in Chapter 30 on electromagnetic radiation how light sometimes behaves as a

particle. This chapter looks at evidence supporting the particle model of light. The idea that

light can have both wave and particle properties was one of the most important discoveries of

the twentieth century.
