10.2.2 Potential Difference and Parallel Resistors

When resistors are connected in parallel the start and end points for all the resistors are the same.

These points have the same potential energy and so the potential difference between them is the

same no matter what is put in between them. You can have one, two or many resistors between

the two points, the potential difference will not change. You can ignore whatever components

are between two points in a circuit when calculating the difference between the two points.

Look at the following circuit diagrams. The battery is the same in all cases, all that changes is

more resistors are added between the points marked by the black dots. If we were to measure

the potential difference between the two dots in these circuits we would get the same answer for

all three cases.

Lets look at two resistors in parallel more closely. When you construct a circuit you use wires and

you might think that measuring the voltage in different places on the wires will make a difference.

This is not true. The potential difference or voltage measurement will only be different if you

measure a different set of components. All points on the wires that have no circuit components

between them will give you the same measurements.

All three of the measurements shown in the picture below will give you the same voltages. The

different measurement points on the left have no components between them so there is no change

in potential energy. Exactly the same applies to the different points on the right. When you

measure the potential difference between the points on the left and right you will get the same

answer.

Definition: Potential Difference

Electrical potential difference as the difference in electrical potential energy per unit charge

between two points. The units of potential difference are the volt (V).

The units are volt (V), which is the same as joule per coulomb, the amount of work done per

unit charge. Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.
