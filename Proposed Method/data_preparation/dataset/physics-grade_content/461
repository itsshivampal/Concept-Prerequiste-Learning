30.1 Introduction

This chapter will focus on the electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a

self-propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components

oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation, and are in phase

with each other. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of

the wave: these types include, in order of increasing frequency, radio waves, microwaves,

infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.
