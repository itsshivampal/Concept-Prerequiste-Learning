12.5 Momentum and Impulse

Momentum is a physical quantity which is closely related to forces. Momentum is a property

which applies to moving objects.

Definition: Momentum

Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue to move in its direction of travel.

Momentum is calculated from the product of the mass and velocity of an object.

The momentum (symbol p) of an object of mass m moving at velocity v is:

p = m · v

According to this equation, momentum is related to both the mass and velocity of an object. A

small car travelling at the same velocity as a big truck will have a smaller momentum than the

truck. The smaller the mass, the smaller the velocity.

A car travelling at 120 km·hr−1will have a bigger momentum than the same car travelling at

60 km·hr−1. Momentum is also related to velocity; the smaller the velocity, the smaller the

momentum.

Different objects can also have the same momentum, for example a car travelling slowly can have

the same momentum as a motor cycle travelling relatively fast. We can easily demonstrate this.

Consider a car of mass 1 000 kg with a velocity of 8 m·s−1(about 30 km·hr−1). The momentum

of the car is therefore

p = m · v

= (1000)(8)

= 8000 kg · m · s−1

12.5 CHAPTER 12. FORCE, MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE - GRADE 11

Now consider a motor cycle of mass 250 kg travelling at 32 m·s−1 (about 115 km·hr−1). The

momentum of the motor cycle is:

p = m · v

= (250)(32)

= 8000 kg · m · s−1

Even though the motor cycle is considerably lighter than the car, the fact that the motor cy-

cle is travelling much faster than the car means that the momentum of both vehicles is the same.

From the calculations above, you are able to derive the unit for momentum as kg·m·s−1.

Momentum is also vector quantity, because it is the product of a scalar (m) with a vector (v).

This means that whenever we calculate the momentum of an object, we need to include the

direction of the momentum.

Worked Example 85: Momentum of a Soccer Ball

Question: A soccer ball of mass 420 g is kicked at 20 m·s−1 towards the goal post.

Calculate the momentum of the ball.

Answer

Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for

The question explicitly gives

• the mass of the ball, and

• the velocity of the ball

The mass of the ball must be converted to SI units.

420 g = 0,42 kg

We are asked to calculate the momentum of the ball. From the definition of mo-

mentum,

p = m · v

we see that we need the mass and velocity of the ball, which we are given.

Step 2 : Do the calculation

We calculate the magnitude of the momentum of the ball,

p = m · v

= (0,42)(20)

= 8,4 kg · m · s−1

Step 3 : Quote the final answer

We quote the answer with the direction of motion included, p = 8,4 kg·m·s−1 in the

direction of the goal post.

Worked Example 87: Momentum of the Moon
Question: The Moon is 384 400 km away from the Earth and orbits the Earth in
27,3 days. If the Moon has a mass of 7,35 x 1022kg, what is the magnitude of its
momentum if we assume a circular orbit?
Answer
Step 1 : Identify what information is given and what is asked for
The question explicitly gives
• the mass of the Moon (m = 7,35 x 1022 kg)
• the distance to the Moon (384 400 km = 384 400 000 m = 3,844 x 108 m)
• the time for one orbit of the Moon (27,3 days = 27,3 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 2,36 x
106 s)
We are asked to calculate only the magnitude of the momentum of the Moon (i.e.
we do not need to specify a direction). In order to do this we require the mass and
the magnitude of the velocity of the Moon, since
p = m · v
Step 2 : Find the magnitude of the velocity of the Moon
The magnitude of the average velocity is the same as the speed. Therefore:
d
s =

We are given the time the Moon takes for one orbit but not how far it travels in that
time. However, we can work this out from the distance to the Moon and the fact
that the Moon has a circular orbit. Using the equation for the circumference, C, of
a circle in terms of its radius, we can determine the distance travelled by the Moon
in one orbit:
C = 2πr
= 2π(3,844× 108)
= 2,42× 109 m

the Moon to complete one orbit, we can determine the magnitude of the Moon's
