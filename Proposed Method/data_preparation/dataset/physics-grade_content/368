22.3.1 Elasticity and plasticity

Materials are classified as plastic or elastic depending on how they respond to an applied force.

It is important to note that plastic substances are not necessarily a type of plastic (polymer)

they only behave like plastic. Think of them as being like plastic which you will be familiar with.

A rubber band is a material that has elasticity. It returns to its original shape after an applied

force is removed, providing that the material is not stretched beyond its elastic limit.

Plasticine is an example of a material that is plastic. If you flatten a ball of plasticine, it will

stay flat. A plastic material does not return to its original shape after an applied force is

removed.

• Elastic materials return to their original shape.

• Plastic materials deform easily and do not return to their original shape.
