9.7.1 Polarisation of Insulators

Unlike conductors, the electrons in insulators (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the

insulator and cannot move around freely in the material. However, a charged object can still

exert a force on a neutral insulator through the concept of polarisation.

If a positively charged rod is brought close to a neutral insulator such as polystyrene, it can

attract the bound electrons to move round to the side of the atoms which is closest to the rod

and cause the positive nuclei to move slightly to the opposite side of the atoms. This process is

called polarisation. Although it is a very small (microscopic) effect, if there are many atoms and

the polarised object is light (e.g. a small polystyrene ball), it can add up to enough force to be

attracted onto the charged rod. Remember, that the polystyrene is only polarised, not charged.

The polystyrene ball is still neutral since no charge was added or removed from it. The picture

shows a not-to-scale view of the polarised atoms in the polystyrene ball:

Some materials are made up of molecules which are already polarised. These are molecules which

have a more positive and a more negative side but are still neutral overall. Just as a polarised

polystyrene ball can be attracted to a charged rod, these materials are also affected if brought

close to a charged object.

Water is an example of a substance which is made of polarised molecules. If a positively charged

rod is brought close to a stream of water, the molecules can rotate so that the negative sides all

line up towards the rod. The stream of water will then be attracted to the rod since opposite

charges attract.

Grounding

If you were to bring the charged rod close to the uncharged electroscope, and then you touched

the metal plate with your finger at the same time, this would cause charge to flow up from the

ground (the earth), through your body onto the metal plate. This is called grounding. The

charge flowing onto the plate is opposite to the charge on the rod, since it is attracted to the

rod. Therefore, for our picture, the charge flowing onto the plate would be negative. Now

charge has been added to the electroscope. It is no longer neutral, but has an excess of negative

charge. Now if we move the rod away, the leaves will remain apart because they have an excess

of negative charge and they repel each other.
