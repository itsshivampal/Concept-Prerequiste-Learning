6.4.1 Reflection of a Transverse Wave from a Fixed End

We have seen that when a pulse meets a fixed endpoint, the pulse is reflected, but it is inverted.

Since a transverse wave is a series of pulses, a transverse wave meeting a fixed endpoint is also

reflected and the reflected wave is inverted. That means that the peaks and troughs are swapped

around.
