13.5 Telescopes

We have seen how a simple lens can be used to correct eyesight. Lenses and mirrors are also

combined to magnify (or make bigger) objects that are far away.

Telescopes use combinations of lenses to gather and focus light. However, telescopes collect light

from objects that are large but far away, like planets and galaxies. For this reason, telescopes

are the tools of astronomers. Astronomy is the study of objects outside the Earth, like stars,

planets, galaxies, comets, and asteroids.

Usually the object viewed with a telescope is very far away. There are two types of objects: those

with a detectable diameter, such as the moon, and objects that appear as points of light, like

stars.

There are many kinds of telescopes, but we will look at two basic types: reflecting and refracting.
