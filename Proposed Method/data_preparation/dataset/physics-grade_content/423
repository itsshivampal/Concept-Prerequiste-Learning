27.2 de Broglie Wavelength

Einstein showed that for a photon, its momentum, p, is equal to its energy, E divided the

speed of light, c:

E

p = .

c

The energy of the photon can also be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the light, λ:

hc

E = ,

λ

where h is Planck's constant. Combining these two equations we find that the the momentum

of the photon is related to its wavelength

hc h

p = = ,

or equivalently

In 1923, Louis de Broglie proposed that this equation not only holds for photons, but also holds

for particles of matter. This is known as the de Broglie hypothesis

Definition: De Broglie Hypothesis

A particle of mass m moving with velocity v has a wavelength λ related to is momentum

p = mv by

h h

λ = = (27.1)

p mv

This wavelength, λ, is known as the de Broglie wavelength of the particle.

27.2 CHAPTER 27. WAVE NATURE OF MATTER - GRADE 12

Since the value of Planck's constant is incredibly small h = 6.63× 10−34 J · s, the wavelike

nature of everyday objects is not really observable.

Itneterreessttinigng The de Broglie hypothesis was proposed by French physicist Louis de Broglie

FFacctt (15 August 1892 - 19 March 1987) in 1923 in his PhD thesis. He was awarded

the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for this work, which made him the first

person to receive a Nobel Prize on a PhD thesis.

Worked Example 174: de Broglie Wavelength of a Cricket Ball

Question: A cricket ball has a mass of 0,150 kg and is bowled towards a bowler at

40m · s−1. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the cricket ball?

Answer

Step 1 : Determine what is required and how to approach the problem

We are required to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a cricket ball given its

mass and speed. We can do this by using:

h

λ =

mv

Step 2 : Determine what is given

We are given:

• The mass of the cricket ball m = 0,150 kg

• The velocity of the cricket ball v = 40m · s−1

and we know:

• Planck's constant h = 6,63× 10−34 J · s

Step 3 : Calculate the de Broglie wavelength

h

λ =

mv

6,63× 10−34 J · s

=

(0,150 kg)(40 m · s−1)

= 1,10× 10−34 m

This wavelength is considerably smaller than the diameter of a proton which is approximately

10−15 m. Hence the wave-like properties of this cricket ball are too small to be observed.

27.3 CHAPTER 27. WAVE NATURE OF MATTER - GRADE 12

Since the de Broglie wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its velocity, the

wavelength decreases as the velocity increases. This is confirmed in the last two examples with

the electrons. De Broglie's hypothesis was confirmed by Davisson and Germer in 1927 when

they observed a beam of electrons being diffracted off a nickel surface. The diffraction means

that the moving electrons have a wave nature. They were also able to determine the wavelength

of the electrons from the diffraction. To measure a wavelength one needs two or more

diffacting centres such as pinholes, slits or atoms. For diffraction to occur the centres must be

separated by a distance about the same size as the wavelength. Theoretically, all objects, not

just sub-atomic particles, exhibit wave properties according to the de Broglie hypothesis.
