11.6.1 Adding Vectors

When vectors are added, we need to add both a magnitude and a direction. For example, take 2

steps in the forward direction, stop and then take another 3 steps in the forward direction. The

first 2 steps is a displacement vector and the second 3 steps is also a displacement vector. If we

did not stop after the first 2 steps, we would have taken 5 steps in the forward direction in total.

Therefore, if we add the displacement vectors for 2 steps and 3 steps, we should get a total of

5 steps in the forward direction. Graphically, this can be seen by first following the first vector

two steps forward and then following the second one three steps forward:

2 steps 3 steps

11.6 CHAPTER 11. VECTORS

We add the second vector at the end of the first vector, since this is where we now are after

the first vector has acted. The vector from the tail of the first vector (the starting point) to the

head of the last (the end point) is then the sum of the vectors. This is the head-to-tail method

of vector addition.

As you can convince yourself, the order in which you add vectors does not matter. In the example

above, if you decided to first go 3 steps forward and then another 2 steps forward, the end result

would still be 5 steps forward.

The final answer when adding vectors is called the resultant. The resultant displacement in this

case will be 5 steps forward.

Definition: Resultant of Vectors

The resultant of a number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the

individual vectors acting together.

In other words, the individual vectors can be replaced by the resultant - the overall effect is the

same. If vectors ~a and ~b have a resultant R~ , this can be represented mathematically as,

R~ = ~a +~b.

Let us consider some more examples of vector addition using displacements. The arrows tell you

how far to move and in what direction. Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward, while

arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the examples below and check

them.

1 step 1 step 2 steps 2 steps

+ = =

This example says 1 step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice

as long - two steps forward.

1 step 1 step 2 steps 2 steps

+ = =

This examples says 1 step backward and then another step backward is the same as an arrow

twice as long - two steps backward.

It is sometimes possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of

what you have done is that you have gone nowhere (your start and end points are at the same

place). In this case, your resultant displacement is a vector with length zero units. We use the

symbol ~0 to denote such a vector:

1 step 1 step 1 step

+ = = ~0

1 step

1 step 1 step 1 step

+ = = ~0

1 step

Check the following examples in the same way. Arrows up the page can be seen as steps left

and arrows down the page as steps right.

+ = = ~0 + = = ~0

It is important to realise that the directions are not special- ‘forward and backwards' or ‘left and

right' are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel directions:

+ = = + = =

+ = = ~0 + = = ~0

In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one another. However the

same head-to-tail technique of vector addition can be applied to vectors in any direction.

+ = = + = = + = =

Now you have discovered one use for vectors; describing resultant displacement - how far and

in what direction you have travelled after a series of movements.

Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with displacements, all vectors behave in

exactly the same way. Thus, if given a number of forces acting on a body you can use the same

method to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to vector addition

in more detail later.
