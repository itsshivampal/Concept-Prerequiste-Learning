10.1 Electric Circuits

In South Africa, people depend on electricity to provide power for most appliances in the home,

at work and out in the world in general. For example, flourescent lights, electric heating and

cooking (on electric stoves), all depend on electricity to work. To realise just how big an impact

electricity has on our daily lives, just think about what happens when there is a power failure or

load shedding.

Activity :: Discussion : Uses of electricity

With a partner, take the following topics and, for each topic, write down at least 5

items/appliances/machines which need electricity to work. Try not to use the same

item more than once.

• At home

• At school

• At the hospital

• In the city

Once you have finished making your lists, compare with the lists of other people in

your class. (Save your lists somewhere safe for later because there will be another

activity for which you'll need them.)

When you start comparing, you should notice that there are many different items

which we use in our daily lives which rely on electricity to work!

Important: Safety Warning: We believe in experimenting and learning about physics at

every opportunity, BUT playing with electricity can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Do

not try to build home made circuits alone. Make sure you have someone with you who knows

if what you are doing is safe. Normal electrical outlets are dangerous. Treat electricity with

respect in your everyday life.
