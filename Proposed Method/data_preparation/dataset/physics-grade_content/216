12.5.5 Newton's Second Law revisited

You have learned about Newton's Second Law of motion earlier in this chapter. Newton's Second

Law describes the relationship between the motion of an object and the net force on the object.

We said that the motion of an object, and therefore its momentum, can only change when a

resultant force is acting on it. We can therefore say that because a net force causes an object

to move, it also causes its momentum to change. We can now define Newton's Second Law of

motion in terms of momentum.

Definition: Newton's Second Law of Motion (N2)

The net or resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum.

Mathematically, Newton's Second Law can be stated as:

∆p

Fnet =

∆t

• the ball's final velocity (vf = 4 m·s−1)

all in the correct units.

We are asked to calculate the change in momentum of the ball,

∆p = mvf −mvi

We have everything we need to find ∆p. Since the initial momentum is directed

downwards and the final momentum is in the upward direction, we can use the al-

gebraic method of subtraction discussed in the vectors chapter.

Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference

Let us choose down as the positive direction.

Step 3 : Do the calculation and quote the answer

∆p = mvf −mvi

= (0,8)(−4)− (0,8)(+6)

= (−3,2)− (4,8)

= −8

= 8 kg · m · s−1 upwards

D F · t

2. A child drops a ball of mass 100 g. The ball strikes the ground with a velocity of 5 m·s−1and

rebounds with a velocity of 4 m·s−1. Calculate the change of momentum of the ball.

3. A 700 kg truck is travelling north at a velocity of 40 km·hr−1when it is approached by a

500 kg car travelling south at a velocity of 100 km·hr−1. Calculate the total momentum

of the system.
