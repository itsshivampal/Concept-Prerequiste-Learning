2.1 Introduction

Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy fabric. The shop assistant would need

to know how much fabric you needed. Telling her you need fabric 2 wide and 6 long would be

insufficient - you have to specify the unit (i.e. 2 metres wide and 6 metres long). Without

the unit the information is incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were

making curtains for a doll's house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide and 6 centimetres

long!

It is not just lengths that have units, all physical quantities have units (e.g. time, temperature,

distance, etc.).

Definition: Physical Quantity

A physical quantity is anything that you can measure. For example, length, temperature,

distance and time are physical quantities.
