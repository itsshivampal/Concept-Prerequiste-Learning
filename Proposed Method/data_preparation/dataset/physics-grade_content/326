19.6 Summary

1. Ohm's Law states that the amount of current through a conductor, at constant

temperature, is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. Mathematically we write

V = R/cdotI

2. Conductors that obey Ohm's Law are called ohmic conductors; those who do not are

called non-ohmic conductors.

3. We use Ohm's Law to calculate the resistance of a resistor. (R = V

I

4. The equivalent resistance of resistors in series (Rs) can be calculated as follows:

Rs = R1 +R2 +R3 + ...+Rn

5. The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel (Rp) can be calculated as follows:

1

R =

1 1

R +1 R +

1 + .. + 1

3 Rn

6. Real batteries have an internal resistance.

7. Wheatstone bridges can be used to accurately determine the resistance of an unknown

resistor.
