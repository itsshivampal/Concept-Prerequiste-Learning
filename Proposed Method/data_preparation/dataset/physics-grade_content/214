12.5.3 Change in Momentum

Let us consider a tennis ball (mass = 0,1 g) that is dropped at an initial velocity of 5 m·s−1and

bounces back at a final velocity of 3 m·s−1. As the ball approaches the floor it has a momentum

that we call the momentum before the collision. When it moves away from the floor it has a

different momentum called the momentum after the collision. The bounce on the floor can be

thought of as a collision taking place where the floor exerts a force on the tennis ball to change

its momentum.

The momentum before the bounce can be calculated as follows:

Because momentum and velocity are vectors, we have to choose a direction as positive. For

this example we choose the initial direction of motion as positive, in other words, downwards is

positive.

pbefore = m · vi

= (0,1)(+5)

= 0,5 kg · m · s−1downwards

When the tennis ball bounces back it changes direction. The final velocity will thus have a

negative value. The momentum after the bounce can be calculated as follows:

pafter = m · vf

= (0,1)(−3)

= −0,3 kg · m · s−1

= 0,3 kg · m · s−1upwards

Now let us look at what happens to the momentum of the tennis ball. The momentum changes

during this bounce. We can calculate the change in momentum as follows:

Again we have to choose a direction as positive and we will stick to our initial choice as down-

wards is positive. This means that the final momentum will have a negative number.

∆p = pf − pi

= m · vf −m · vi

= (−0,3)− (0,5)

= −0,8 kg · m · s−1

= 0,8 kg · m · s−1upwards

You will notice that this number is bigger than the previous momenta calculated. This is should

be the case as the ball needed to be stopped and then given momentum to bounce back.

initial velocity of 6 m·s−1. It bounces back with a final velocity of 4 m·s−1. Calculate

• the ball's final velocity (vf = 4 m·s−1)

all in the correct units.

We are asked to calculate the change in momentum of the ball,

∆p = mvf −mvi

We have everything we need to find ∆p. Since the initial momentum is directed

downwards and the final momentum is in the upward direction, we can use the al-

gebraic method of subtraction discussed in the vectors chapter.

Step 2 : Choose a frame of reference

Let us choose down as the positive direction.

Step 3 : Do the calculation and quote the answer

∆p = mvf −mvi

= (0,8)(−4)− (0,8)(+6)

= (−3,2)− (4,8)

= −8

= 8 kg · m · s−1 upwards
