14.7 Summary - Longitudinal Waves

1. A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the

direction in which the wave is travelling.

2. Longitudinal waves consist of areas of higher pressure, where the particles in the medium

are closer together (compressions) and areas of lower pressure, where the particles in the

medium are further apart (rarefactions).

3. The wavelength of a longitudinal wave is the distance between two consecutive

compressions, or two consecutive rarefactions.

4. The relationship between the period (T ) and frequency (f) is given by

CHAPTER 14. LONGITUDINAL WAVES - GRADE 11 14.6

Sound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is

denser than air (the particles are closer together). Sound waves travel faster in solids than in

liquids.

Figure 14.8: Sound waves are pressure waves and need a medium through which to travel.

Important: A sound wave is different from a light wave.

• A sound wave is produced by an oscillating object while a light wave is not.

• A sound wave cannot be diffracted while a light wave can be diffracted.

Also, because a sound wave is a mechanical wave (i.e. that it needs a medium) it is not

capable of traveling through a vacuum, whereas a light wave can travel through a vacuum.

Important: A sound wave is a pressure wave. This means that regions of high pressure

(compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates.

These compressions and rarefactions arise because sound vibrates longitudinally and the

longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.

Sound will be studied in more detail in Chapter 15.

14.6 Seismic Waves

Seismic waves are waves from vibrations in the Earth (core, mantle, oceans). Seismic waves

also occur on other planets, for example the moon and can be natural (due to earthquakes,

volcanic eruptions or meteor strikes) or man-made (due to explosions or anything that hits the

earth hard). Seismic P-waves (P for pressure) are longitudinal waves which can travel through

solid and liquid.
