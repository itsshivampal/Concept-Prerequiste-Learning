21.2 Vertical Projectile Motion

In Chapter 4, we studied the motion of objects in free fall and we saw that an object in free fall

falls with gravitational acceleration g. Now we can consider the motion of objects that are

thrown upwards and then fall back to the Earth. We call this projectile motion and we will only

consider the situation where the object is thrown straight upwards and then falls straight

downwards - this means that there is no horizontal displacement of the object, only a vertical

displacement.
