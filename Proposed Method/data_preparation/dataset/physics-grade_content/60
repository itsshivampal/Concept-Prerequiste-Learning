5.3 What is a pulse?

Activity :: Investigation : Observation of Pulses

Take a heavy rope. Have two people hold the rope stretched out horizontally.

Flick the rope at one end only once.

flick rope upwards at one end, once only

What happens to the disturbance that you created in the rope? Does it stay at the

place where it was created or does it move down the length of the rope?

5.3 CHAPTER 5. TRANSVERSE PULSES - GRADE 10

In the activity, we created a pulse. A pulse is a single disturbance that moves through a

medium. A transverse pulse moves perpendicular to the medium. Figure 5.1 shows an example

of a transverse pulse. In the activity, the rope or spring was held horizontally and the pulse

moved the rope up and down. This was an example of a transverse pulse.

Definition: Pulse

A pulse is a single disturbance that moves through a medium.

Transverse Pulses - Grade 10

5.1 Introduction

This chapter forms the basis of the discussion into mechanical waves. Waves are all around us,

even though most of us are not aware of it. The most common waves are waves in the sea, but

waves can be created in any container of water, ranging from an ocean to a tea-cup. Simply, a

wave is moving energy.

5.2 What is a medium?

In this chapter, as well as in the following chapters, we will speak about waves moving in a

medium. A medium is just the substance or material through which waves move. In other words

the medium carries the wave from one place to another. The medium does not create the wave

and the medium is not the wave. Air is a medium for sound waves, water is a medium for water

waves and rock is a medium for earthquakes (which are also a type of wave). Air, water and

rock are therefore examples of media (media is the plural of medium).

Definition: Medium

A medium is the substance or material in which a wave will move.

In each medium, the atoms that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest

position. In order for a wave to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact

with each other.
