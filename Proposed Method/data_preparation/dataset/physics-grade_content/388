24.2 The Doppler Effect with Sound and Ultrasound

As seen in the introduction, there are two situations which lead to the Doppler Effect:

1. When the source moves relative to the observer, for example the pitch of a car hooter as

it passes by.

2. When the observer moves relative to the source, for example the pitch of a radio on the

pavement as you drive by.

Definition: Doppler Effect

The Doppler effect is the apparent change in frequency and wavelength of a wave when the

observer and the source of the wave move relative to each other.

We experience the Doppler effect quite often in our lives, without realising that it is science

taking place. The changing sound of a taxi hooter or ambulance as it drives past are examples

of this as you have seen in the introduction.

The question is how does the Doppler effect take place. Let us consider a source of sound

waves with a constant frequency and amplitude. The sound waves can be drawn as concentric

circles where each circle represents another wavefront, like in figure 24.1 below.

The sound source is the dot in the middle and is stationary. For the Doppler effect to take

place, the source must be moving. Let's consider the following situation: The source (dot)

emits one peak (represented by a circle) that moves away from the source at the same rate in

all directions.

As this peak moves away, the source also moves and then emits the second peak. Now the two

circles are not concentric any more, but on the one side they are closer together and on the

other side they are further apart. This is shown in the next diagram.

If the source continues moving at the same speed in the same direction (i.e. with the same

velocity which you will learn more about later). then the distance between peaks on the right

of the source is the constant. The distance between peaks on the left is also constant but they

are different on the left and right.

This means that the time between peaks on the right is less so the frequency is higher. It is
higher than on the left and higher than if the source were not moving at all.
On the left hand side the peaks are further apart than on the right and further apart than if the
source were at rest - this means the frequency is lower.
When a car appoaches you, the sound waves that reach you have a shorter wavelength and a
higher frequency. You hear a higher sound. When the car moves away from you, the sound
waves that reach you have a longer wavelength and lower frequency. You hear a lower sound.
This change in frequency can be calculated by using:
v ± vL
fL = f ( 4 1
v ∓ S 2 . )vS
where fL is the frequency perceived by the listener,
fS is the frequency of the source,
v is the speed of the waves,
vL the speed of the listener and
vS the speed of the source.
Worked Example 157: The Doppler Effect for Sound
Question: The siren of an ambulance has a frequency of 700 Hz. You are
standing on the pavement. If the ambulance drives past you at a speed of 20
m·s−1, what frequency will you hear, when
a) the ambulance is approaching you
b) the ambulance is driving away from you
Take the speed of sound to be 340 m·s−1.
Answer
Step 1 : Determine how to appoach the problem based on what is given
v ± vL
fL = f
v ∓ SvS

v = 340m · s−1
vL = 0
vS = −20m · s−1 for (a) and
vS = 20m · s−1 for (b)
Step 2 : Determine fL when ambulance is appoaching

Worked Example 158: The Doppler Effect for Sound 2
Question: What is the frequency heard by a person driving at 15 m·s−1 toward a
factory whistle that is blowing at a frequency of 800 Hz. Assume that the speed of
sound is 340 m·s−1.
Answer
Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem based on what is given
We can use
v ± vL
fL = f
v ∓ SvS
with:
v = 340,6m · s−1
vL = +15m · s−1
vS = 0m · s−1
fS = 800 Hz
fL = ?
The listener is moving towards the source, so vL is positive.
Step 2 : Calculate the frequency
v ± vL
fL = f
v ∓ SvS
340,6m · s−1 + 15m · s−1
= (800 H
340,6m · z)s−1 + 0m · s−1
= 835 Hz
Step 3 : Write the final answer
The driver hears a frequency of 835 Hz.
Itneterreessttinigng Radar-based speed-traps use the Doppler Effect. The radar gun emits radio
FFacctt waves of a specific frequency. When the car is standing still, the waves reflected
waves are the same frequency as the waves emitted by the radar gun. When
the car is moving the Doppler frequency shift can be used to determine the
speed of the car.
