5.7 Superposition of Pulses

Two or more pulses can pass through the same medium at that same time. The resulting pulse

is obtained by using the principle of superposition. The principle of superposition states that the

effect of the pulses is the sum of their individual effects. After pulses pass through each other,

each pulse continues along its original direction of travel, and their original amplitudes remain

unchanged.

Constructive interference takes place when two pulses meet each other to create a larger pulse.

The amplitude of the resulting pulse is the sum of the amplitudes of the two initial pulses. This

is shown in Figure 5.11.

Definition: Constructive interference is when two pulses meet, resulting in a bigger

pulse.

pulses move towards each other

pulses constructively interfere

pulses move away from other

Figure 5.11: Superposition of two pulses: constructive interference.

Destructive interference takes place when two pulses meet and cancel each other. The amplitude

of the resulting pulse is the sum of the amplitudes of the two initial pulses, but the one amplitude

will be a negative number. This is shown in Figure 5.12. In general, amplitudes of individual

pulses add together to give the amplitude of the resultant pulse.

Definition: Destructive interference is when two pulses meet, resulting in a smaller

pulse.

Figure 5.12: Superposition of two pulses. The left-hand series of images demonstrates destructive

interference, since the pulses cancel each other. The right-hand series of images demonstrate a

partial cancelation of two pulses, as their amplitudes are not the same in magnitude.
