11.7.1 Graphical Techniques

Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote individual vectors and

their resultants. We next discuss the two primary graphical techniques, the head-to-tail technique

and the parallelogram method.

CHAPTER 11. VECTORS 11.7

The Head-to-Tail Method

In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used displacements and the head-to-tail

graphical method of vector addition as an illustration. The head-to-tail method of graphically

adding vectors is a standard method that must be understood.

Method: Head-to-Tail Method of Vector Addition

1. Choose a scale and include a reference direction.

2. Choose any of the vectors and draw it as an arrow in the correct direction and of the

correct length - remember to put an arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.

3. Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the arrowhead of the first vector

in the correct direction and of the correct length.

4. Continue until you have drawn each vector - each time starting from the head of the

previous vector. In this way, the vectors to be added are drawn one after the other head-

to-tail.

5. The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the

last. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its

direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.

Worked Example 50: Head-to-Tail Addition I

Question: A ship leaves harbour H and sails 6 km north to port A. From here

the ship travels 12 km east to port B, before sailing 5,5 km south-west to port

C. Determine the ship's resultant displacement using the head-to-tail technique of

vector addition.

Answer

Step 1 : Draw a rough sketch of the situation

Its easy to understand the problem if we first draw a quick sketch. The rough sketch

should include all of the information given in the problem. All of the magnitudes

of the displacements are shown and a compass has been included as a reference

direction. In a rough sketch one is interested in the approximate shape of the vector

diagram.

Step 2 : Choose a scale and include a reference direction.

The choice of scale depends on the actual question - you should choose a scale such

that your vector diagram fits the page.

It is clear from the rough sketch that choosing a scale where 1 cm represents 2 km

(scale: 1 cm = 2 km) would be a good choice in this problem. The diagram will then

take up a good fraction of an A4 page. We now start the accurate construction.

Step 3 : Choose any of the vectors to be summed and draw it as an arrow

in the correct direction and of the correct length - remember to put an

arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.

Starting at the harbour H we draw the first vector 3 cm long in the direction north.

In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used displacements and the head-to-tail

Step 4 : Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the head

Step 6 : The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the first
vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be determined from the
length of its arrow using the scale. Its direction too can be determined from
the scale diagram.
As a final step we draw the resultant displacement from the starting point (the
harbour H) to the end point (port C). We use a ruler to measure the length of this
arrow and a protractor to determine its direction.

Step 7 : Apply the scale conversion
We now use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to
the actual displacement in the problem. Since we have chosen a scale of 1 cm =
2 km in this problem the resultant has a magnitude of 9,2 km. The direction can
be specified in terms of the angle measured either as 072,3◦ east of north or on a
bearing of 072,3◦.

Step 8 : Quote the final answer
The resultant displacement of the ship is 9,2 km on a bearing of 072,3◦.
Worked Example 51: Head-to-Tail Graphical Addition II

2. What is his resultant displacement?

Step 2 : Determine the distance that the man traveled
In the first part of his journey he traveled 40 m and in the second part he traveled
30 m. This gives us a total distance traveled of 40 m + 30 m = 70 m.
Step 3 : Determine his resultant displacement
The man's resultant displacement is the vector from where he started to where he
ended. It is the vector sum of his two separate displacements. We will use the
head-to-tail method of accurate construction to find this vector.
Step 4 : Choose a suitable scale
A scale of 1 cm represents 10 m (1 cm = 10 m) is a good choice here. Now we can
begin the process of construction.
Step 5 : Draw the first vector to scale
We draw the first displacement as an arrow 4 cm long in an eastwards direction.

4 cm = 40 m

4 cm = 40 m
Step 7 : Determine the resultant vector
Now we connect the starting point to the end point and measure the length and
direction of this arrow (the resultant).

4 cm = 40 m
Step 8 : Find the direction
To find the direction you measure the angle between the resultant and the 40 m
vector. You should get about 37◦.
Step 9 : Apply the scale conversion
Finally we use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to
the actual magnitude of the resultant displacement. According to the chosen scale
1 cm = 10 m. Therefore 5 cm represents 50 m. The resultant displacement is then
50 m 37◦ north of east.
The Parallelogram Method
The parallelogram method is another graphical technique of finding the resultant of two vectors.
Method: The Parallelogram Method
1. Choose a scale and a reference direction.
2. Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct length in
the correct direction.
3. Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction from the
tail of the first vector.
4. Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.
5. The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. The magnitude can be determined
from the length of its arrow using the scale. The direction too can be determined from
the scale diagram.

4 cm = 40 m

Step 8 : Find the direction

To find the direction you measure the angle between the resultant and the 40 m

vector. You should get about 37◦.

Step 9 : Apply the scale conversion

Finally we use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to

the actual magnitude of the resultant displacement. According to the chosen scale

1 cm = 10 m. Therefore 5 cm represents 50 m. The resultant displacement is then

50 m 37◦ north of east.

The Parallelogram Method

The parallelogram method is another graphical technique of finding the resultant of two vectors.

Method: The Parallelogram Method

1. Choose a scale and a reference direction.

2. Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct length in

the correct direction.

3. Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction from the

tail of the first vector.

4. Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.

5. The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. The magnitude can be determined

from the length of its arrow using the scale. The direction too can be determined from

the scale diagram.

Step 2 : Choose a suitable scale

In this problem a scale of 1 cm = 1 N would be appropriate, since then the vector

diagram would take up a reasonable fraction of the page. We can now begin the

accurate scale diagram.

Step 3 : Draw the first scaled vector

Let us draw F1 first. According to the scale it has length 5 cm.

Step 4 : Draw the second scaled vector

Next we draw F2. According to the scale it has length 4 cm. We make use of a

protractor to draw this vector at 30◦ to the horizontal.

The resultant has a measured length of 8,7 cm.

Step 6 : Find the direction

We use a protractor to measure the angle between the horizontal and the resultant.

We get 13,3◦.

Step 7 : Apply the scale conversion

Finally we use the scale to convert the measured length into the actual magnitude.

Since 1 cm = 1 N, 8,7 cm represents 8,7 N. Therefore the resultant force is 8,7 N

at 13,3◦ above the horizontal.

The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two vectors. However, it is arguably

the most intuitive way of adding two forces acting at a point.
