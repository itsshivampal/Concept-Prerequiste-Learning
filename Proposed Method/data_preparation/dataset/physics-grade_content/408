Chapter 26

2D and 3D Wavefronts - Grade 12

26.1 Introduction

You have learnt about the basic principles of reflection and refraction. In this chapter, you will

learn about phenomena that arise with waves in two and three dimensions: interference and

diffraction.

26.2 Wavefronts

Activity :: Investigation : Wavefronts

The diagram shows three identical waves being emitted by three point sources.

All points marked with the same letter are in phase. Join all points with the same

letter.

What type of lines (straight, curved, etc) do you get? How does this compare

to the line that joins the sources?

Consider three point sources of waves. If each source emits waves isotropically (i.e. the same in

all directions) we will get the situation shown in as shown in Figure 26.1.

We define a wavefront as the imaginary line that joins waves that are in phase. These are

indicated by the grey, vertical lines in Figure 26.1. The points that are in phase can be peaks,

troughs or anything in between, it doesn't matter which points you choose as long as they are

in phase.
