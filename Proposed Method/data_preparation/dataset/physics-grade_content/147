10.2.3 Potential Difference and Series Resistors

When resistors are in series, one after the other, there is a potential difference across each

resistor. The total potential difference across a set of resistors in series is the sum of the

potential differences across each of the resistors in the set. This is the same as falling a large

distance under gravity or falling that same distance (difference) in many smaller steps. The total

distance (difference) is the same.

Look at the circuits below. If we measured the potential difference between the black dots in

all of these circuits it would be the same just like we saw above. So we now know the total

potential difference is the same across one, two or three resistors. We also know that some work

is required to make charge flow through each one, each is a step down in potential energy. These

steps add up to the total drop which we know is the difference between the two dots.

Let us look at this in a bit more detail. In the picture below you can see what the different

measurements for 3 identical resistors in series could look like. The total voltage across all three

resistors is the sum of the voltages across the individual resistors.
