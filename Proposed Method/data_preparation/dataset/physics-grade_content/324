19.4 Series and parallel networks of resistors

Now that you know how to handle simple series and parallel circuits, you are ready to tackle

problems like this:

It is relatively easy to work out these kind of circuits because you use everything you have

already learnt about series and parallel circuits. The only difference is that you do it in stages.

Figure 19.1: An example of a series-parallel network. The dashed boxes indicate parallel sections

of the circuit.

In Figure 19.1, the circuit consists of 2 parallel portions that are then in series with 1 resistor.

So, in order to work out the equivalent resistance, you start by reducing the parallel portions to

a single resistor and then add up all the resistances in series. If all the resistors in Figure 19.1

had resistances of 10 Ω, we can calculate the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.

We start by reducing Parallel Circuit 1 to a single resistor.
