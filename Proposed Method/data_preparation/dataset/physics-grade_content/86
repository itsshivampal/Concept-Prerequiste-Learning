6.4.5 Wavelengths of Standing Waves with Fixed and Free Ends

There are many applications which make use of the properties of waves and the use of fixed and

free ends. Most musical instruments rely on the basic picture that we have presented to create

specific sounds, either through standing pressure waves or standing vibratory waves in strings.

The key is to understand that a standing wave must be created in the medium that is oscillating.

There are restrictions as to what wavelengths can form standing waves in a medium.

For example, if we consider a rope that can move in a pipe such that it can have

• both ends free to move (Case 1)

• one end free and one end fixed (Case 2)

• both ends fixed (Case 3).

Each of these cases is slightly different because the free or fixed end determines whether a node or

anti-node will form when a standing wave is created in the rope. These are the main restrictions

when we determine the wavelengths of potential standing waves. These restrictions are known

as boundary conditions and must be met.

CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10 6.4

In the diagram below you can see the three different cases. It is possible to create standing

waves with different frequencies and wavelengths as long as the end criteria are met.

Case 1 Case 2 Case 3

L L L

The longer the wavelength the less the number of anti-nodes in the standing waves. We cannot

have a standing wave with no anti-nodes because then there would be no oscillations. We use n

to number the anti-nodes. If all of the tubes have a length L and we know the end constraints

we can find the wavelength, λ, for a specific number of anti-nodes.

One Node

Let's work out the longest wavelength we can have in each tube, i.e. the case for n = 1.

λ = 2L λ = 4L

n = 1

Case 1: In the first tube, both ends must be nodes, so we can place one anti-node in the middle

of the tube. We know the distance from one node to another is 12λ and we also know this

distance is L. So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength:

1

λ = L

2

λ = 2L

Case 2: In the second tube, one end must be a node and the other must be an anti-node. We

are looking at the case with one anti-node we are forced to have it at the end. We know the

distance from one node to another is 12λ but we only have half this distance contained in the

tube. So :

1 1

( λ) = L

2 2

λ = 4L

Case 3: Here both ends are closed and so we must have two nodes so it is impossible to construct

a case with only one node.

Two Nodes

Next we determine which wavelengths could be formed if we had two nodes. Remember that we

are dividing the tube up into smaller and smaller segments by having more nodes so we expect

the wavelengths to get shorter.

λ = L λ = 43L λ = 2L

n = 2

Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have two nodes inside

the tube only if we have one anti-node contained inside the tube and one on each end. This

means we have 3 anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half

a wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between the left side and the middle and

another half wavelength between the middle and the right side so there must be one wavelength

inside the tube. The safest thing to do is work out how many half wavelengths there are and

equate this to the length of the tube L and then solve for λ.

CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10 6.4
In the diagram below you can see the three different cases. It is possible to create standing
waves with different frequencies and wavelengths as long as the end criteria are met.
Case 1 Case 2 Case 3
L L L
The longer the wavelength the less the number of anti-nodes in the standing waves. We cannot
have a standing wave with no anti-nodes because then there would be no oscillations. We use n
to number the anti-nodes. If all of the tubes have a length L and we know the end constraints
we can find the wavelength, λ, for a specific number of anti-nodes.
One Node
Let's work out the longest wavelength we can have in each tube, i.e. the case for n = 1.
λ = 2L λ = 4L
n = 1
Case 1: In the first tube, both ends must be nodes, so we can place one anti-node in the middle
of the tube. We know the distance from one node to another is 12λ and we also know this
distance is L. So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength:
1
λ = L
2
λ = 2L
Case 2: In the second tube, one end must be a node and the other must be an anti-node. We
are looking at the case with one anti-node we are forced to have it at the end. We know the
distance from one node to another is 12λ but we only have half this distance contained in the
tube. So :
1 1
( λ) = L
2 2
λ = 4L
Case 3: Here both ends are closed and so we must have two nodes so it is impossible to construct
a case with only one node.
Two Nodes
Next we determine which wavelengths could be formed if we had two nodes. Remember that we
are dividing the tube up into smaller and smaller segments by having more nodes so we expect
the wavelengths to get shorter.
λ = L λ = 43L λ = 2L
n = 2
Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have two nodes inside
the tube only if we have one anti-node contained inside the tube and one on each end. This
means we have 3 anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half
a wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between the left side and the middle and
another half wavelength between the middle and the right side so there must be one wavelength
inside the tube. The safest thing to do is work out how many half wavelengths there are and
equate this to the length of the tube L and then solve for λ.

λ = L
Case 2: We want to have two nodes inside the tube. The left end must be a node and the right
end must be an anti-node. We can have one node inside the tube as drawn above. Again we can
count the number of distances between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes. If we start from the left
end we have one half wavelength between the end and the node inside the tube. The distance
from the node inside the tube to the right end which is an anti-node is half of the distance to
another node. So it is half of half a wavelength. Together these add up to the length of the
tube:
1 1 1
λ+ ( λ) = L
2 2 2
2 1
λ+ λ = L

Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. This means that the length of the tube is one
half wavelength: So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength:
1
λ = L
2
λ = 2L
Important: If you ever calculate a longer wavelength for more nodes you have made a
mistake. Remember to check if your answers make sense!
Three Nodes
To see the complete pattern for all cases we need to check what the next step for case 3 is when
we have an additional node. Below is the diagram for the case where n = 3.
λ = 23L λ =
4
5L λ = L
n = 3
Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have three nodes inside
the tube only if we have two anti-nodes contained inside the tube and one on each end. This
means we have 4 anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half a
wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between every adjacent pair of anti-nodes.
We count how many gaps there are between adjacent anti-nodes to determine how many half
wavelengths there are and equate this to the length of the tube L and then solve for λ.

Case 2: We want to have three nodes inside the tube. The left end must be a node and the
right end must be an anti-node, so there will be two nodes between the ends of the tube. Again

CHAPTER 6. TRANSVERSE WAVES - GRADE 10 6.4

we can count the number of distances between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes, together these add

up to the length of the tube. Remember that the distance between the node and an adjacent

anti-node is only half the distance between adjacent nodes. So starting from the left end we

count 3 nodes, so 2 half wavelength intervals and then only a node to anti-node distance:

1 1 1

sets of adjacent nodes. This means that the length of the tube consists of two half wavelength

sections:
