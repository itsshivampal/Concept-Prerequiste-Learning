12.4.1 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Definition: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force directed along the line connecting

the two. This force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional

to the square of the distance between them.

The magnitude of the attractive gravitational force between the two point masses, F is given

by:

m1m2

F = G (12.2)

r2

where: G is the gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of the first point mass, m2 is the mass

of the second point mass and r is the distance between the two point masses.

Assuming SI units, F is measured in newtons (N), m1 and m2 in kilograms (kg), r in meters

(m), and the constant G is approximately equal to 6,67× 10−11N ·m2 · kg−2. Remember that

this is a force of attraction.

For example, consider a man of mass 80 kg standing 10 m from a woman with a mass of 65 kg.

The attractive gravitational force between them would be:

F = G

r2

(80)(65)

= (6,67× 10−11)( )

(10)2

= 3,47× 10−9 N

If the man and woman move to 1 m apart, then the force is:

m1m2

F = G

r2

(80)(65)

= (6,67× 10−11)( )

(1)2

= 3,47× 10−7 N

As you can see, these forces are very small.

Now consider the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. The mass of the Earth is

5,98×1024 kg, the mass of the Moon is 7,35×1022 kg and the Earth and Moon are 0,38×109 m

apart. The gravitational force between the Earth and Moon is:

m1m2

F = G

r2

(5,98× 1024)

= (6,67× 10−11 (7,35× 10

22)

)( )

(0,38× 109)2

= 2,03× 1020 N

From this example you can see that the force is very large.

These two examples demonstrate that the bigger the masses, the greater the force between them.

The 1/r2 factor tells us that the distance between the two bodies plays a role as well. The closer

two bodies are, the stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational

attraction of the Earth most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it, but if we

were in outer-space, we would barely even know the Earth's gravity existed!

Remember that

F = m · a (12.3)

which means that every object on Earth feels the same gravitational acceleration! That means

whether you drop a pen or a book (from the same height), they will both take the same length

of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them

at the same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (Equations 12.2

and 12.3). The force between the Earth (which has the mass me) and an object of mass mo is

Gmome

F = (12.4)

r2

and the acceleration of an object of mass mo (in terms of the force acting on it) is

F

ao = (12.5)

mo

So we substitute equation (12.4) into Equation (12.5), and we find that

Gme

ao = (12.6)

r2

Since it doesn't matter what mo is, this tells us that the acceleration on a body (due to the

Earth's gravity) does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects experience the same

gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be different but the acceleration will

be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects

we label it differently, instead of using a we use g which we call the gravitational acceleration.
