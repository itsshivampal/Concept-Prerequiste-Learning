19.3.1 Equivalent resistance

When there is more than one resistor in a circuit, we are usually able to replace all resistors

with a single resistor whose effect is the same as all the resistors put together. The resistance

of the single resistor is known as equivalent resistance. We are able to calculate equivalent

resistance for resistors connected in series and parallel.

Equivalent Series Resistance

Consider a circuit consisting of three resistors and a single battery connected in series.

R1

A B

b b

V R2

b b

D C

R3

The first principle to understand about series circuits is that the amount of current is the same

through any component in the circuit. This is because there is only one path for electrons to

flow in a series circuit. From the way that the battery is connected, we can tell which direction

the current will flow. We know that charge flows from positive to negative, by convention.

Current in this circuit will flow in a clockwise direction, from point A to B to C to D and back

to A.

So, how do we use this knowledge to calculate the value of a single resistor that can replace

the three resistors in the circuit and still have the same current?

We know that in a series circuit the current has to be the same in all components. So we can

write:

I = I1 = I2 = I3

We also know that total voltage of the circuit has to be equal to the sum of the voltages over

all three resistors. So we can write:

V = V1 + V2 + V3

Finally, we know that Ohm's Law has to apply for each resistor individually, which gives us:

V1 = I1 ·R1

V2 = I2 ·R2

V3 = I3 ·R3

Therefore:

V = I1 ·R1 + I2 · R2 + I3 ·R3

However, because

I = I1 = I2 = I3

, we can further simplify this to:

V = I · R1 + I ·R2 + I ·R3

= I(R1 +R2 +R3)

Further, we can write an Ohm's Law relation for the entire circuit:

V = I · R

Therefore:
V = I(R1 +R2 +R3)
I ·R = I(R1 +R2 +R3)
∴ R = R1 +R2 +R3
Definition: Equivalent resistance in a series circuit, Rs
For n resistors in series the equivalent resistance is:
Rs = R1 +R2 +R3 + · · ·+Rn
Let us apply this to the following circuit.
R1=3 kΩ
A B
b b
9 V R2=10 kΩ
b b
D C
R3=5 kΩ
The resistors are in series, therefore:
Rs = R1 +R2 +R3
= 3Ω+ 10Ω + 5Ω
= 18Ω
Worked Example 125: Equivalent series resistance I
Question: Two 10 kΩ resistors are connected in series. Calculate the equivalent
resistance.
Answer
Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem
Since the resistors are in series we can use:
Rs = R1 +R2
Step 2 : Solve the problem
Rs = R1 +R2
= 10 kΩ+ 10 kΩ
= 20 kΩ
Step 3 : Write the final answer
The equivalent resistance of two 10 kΩ resistors connected in series is 20 kΩ.

Worked Example 126: Equivalent series resistance II
Question: Two resistors are connected in series. The equivalent resistance is
100 Ω. If one resistor is 10 Ω, calculate the value of the second resistor.
Answer
Step 1 : Determine how to approach the problem
Since the resistors are in series we can use:
Rs = R1 +R2
We are given the value of Rs and R1.
Step 2 : Solve the problem
Rs = R1 +R2
∴ R2 = Rs −R1
= 100Ω− 10Ω
= 90Ω
Step 3 : Write the final answer
The second resistor has a resistance of 90Ω.
Equivalent parallel resistance
Consider a circuit consisting of a single battery and three resistors that are connected in parallel.
A B C D
b b b b
V R1 R2 R3
b b b b
H G F E
The first principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the voltage is equal across all
components in the circuit. This is because there are only two sets of electrically common
points in a parallel circuit, and voltage measured between sets of common points must always
be the same at any given time. So, for the circuit shown, the following is true:
V = V1 = V2 = V3
The second principle for a parallel circuit is that all the currents through each resistor must add
up to the total current in the circuit.
I = I1 + I2 + I3
Also, from applying Ohm's Law to the entire circuit, we can write:
I
V =
Rp
where Rp is the equivalent resistance in this parallel arrangement.
