12.2.7 Exercise

1. A force acts on an object. Name three effects that the force can have on the object.

2. Identify each of the following forces as contact or non-contact forces.

2.1 The force between the north pole of a magnet and a paper clip.

2.2 The force required to open the door of a taxi.

2.3 The force required to stop a soccer ball.

2.4 The force causing a ball, dropped from a height of 2 m, to fall to the floor.

3. A book of mass 2 kg is lying on a table. Draw a labeled force diagram indicating all the

forces on the book.

4. A boy pushes a shopping trolley (mass 15 kg) with a constant force of 75 N. A constant

frictional force of 20 N is present.

4.1 Draw a labeled force diagram to identify all the forces acting on the shopping trolley.

4.2 Draw a free body diagram of all the horizontal forces acting on the trolley.

4.3 Determine the resultant force on the trolley.

5. A donkey (mass 250 kg) is trying to pull a cart (mass 80 kg) with a force of 400 N. The

rope between the donkey and the cart makes an angle of 30â—¦ with the cart. The cart does

not move.

5.1 Draw a free body diagram of all the forces acting on the donkey.

5.2 Draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the cart.

5.3 Find the magnitude and direction of the frictional force preventing the cart from

moving.
