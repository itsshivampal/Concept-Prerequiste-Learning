31.3 The photoelectric effect

Around the turn of the twentieth century, it was observed by a number of physicists (including

Hertz, Thomson and Von Lenard) that when light was shone on a metal, electrons were

emitted by the metal. This is called the photoelectric effect. (photo- for light, electric- for the

electron.)

Definition: The photoelectric effect

The photoelectric effect is the process whereby an electron is emitted by a metal when light

shines on it.

At that time, light was thought to be purely a wave. Therefore, physicists thought that if a

more intense (i.e. brighter) light was shone on a metal, then the electrons would be knocked

out with greater kinetic energies than if a faint light was shone on them. However, Von Lenard

observed that this did not happen at all. The intensity of the light made no difference to the

kinetic energy of the emitted electrons! Also, it was observed that the electrons were emitted

immediately when light was shone on the metal - there was no time delay.

Einstein solved this problem by proposing that light is made up of packets of energy called

quanta (now called photons) which interacted with the electrons in the metal like particles

instead of waves. Each incident photon would transfer all its energy to one electron in the

metal. For a specific colour of light (i.e. a certain wavelength or frequency), the energy of the

photons is given by E = hf = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant. The energy needed to

knock an electron out of the metal is called the work function (symbol φ) of the metal.

Therefore, the amount of energy left over as the kinetic energy (Ek) of the emitted electron

would be the difference between the incoming photon's energy and the energy needed to knock

out the electron (work function of the metal):

Ek = hf − φ

Increasing the intensity of the light (i.e. making it brighter) did not change the wavelength of

the light and therefore the electrons would be emitted with the same kinetic energy as before!

This solved the paradox and showed that light has both a wave nature and a particle nature.

Einstein won the Nobel prize for this quantum theory and his explanation of the photoelectric

effect.

Increasing the intensity of the light actually means increasing the number of incident photons.

Therefore, since each photon only gives energy to one electron, more incident photons

meansmore electrons would be knocked out of the metal, but their kinetic energies would be

the same as before.

breakthroughs in science in the twentieth century as it provided concrete evidence of the

particle nature of light. It overturned previously held views that light was composed purely of a

continuous transverse wave. On the one hand, the wave nature is a good description of

phenomena such as diffraction and interference for light, and on the other hand, the

photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light. This is now known as the

‘dual-nature' of light. (dual means two)

While solving problems we need to decide for ourselves whether we should consider the wave

property or the particle property of light. For example, when dealing with interference and

diffraction, light should be treated as a wave, whereas when dealing with photoelectric effect

we consider the particle nature.
