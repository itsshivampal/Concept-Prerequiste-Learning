17.5.1 Capacitors and capacitance

A parallel plate capacitor is a device that consists of two oppositely charged conducting plates

separated by a small distance, which stores charge. When voltage is applied to the capacitor,

electric charge of equal magnitude, but opposite polarity, build up on each plate.

Definition: Capacitance

Capacitance is the charge stored per volt and is measured in farad (F)

Mathematically, capacitance is the ratio of the charge on a single plate to the voltage across

the plates of the capacitor:

Capacitance is measured in farads (F). Since capacitance is defined as C = QV , the units are in

terms of charge over potential difference. The unit of charge is the coulomb and the unit of the

potential difference is the volt. One farad is therefore the capacitance if one coulomb of charge

was stored on a capacitor for every volt applied.

1 C of charge is a very large amount of charge. So, for a small amount of voltage applied, a

1 F capacitor can store a enormous amount of charge. Therefore, capacitors are often denoted

in terms of microfarads (1 × 10−6), nanofarads (1× 10−9), or picofarads (1× 10−12).

Important: Q is the magnitude of the charge stored on either plate, not on both plates

added together. Since one plate stores positive charge and the other stores negative charge,

the total charge on the two plates is zero.

Worked Example 118: Capacitance

Question: Suppose that a 5 V battery is connected in a circuit to a 5 pF

capacitor. After the battery has been connected for a long time, what is the charge

stored on each of the plates?

Answer

To begin remember that after a voltage has been applied for a long time the

capacitor is fully charged. The relation between voltage and the maximum charge

of a capacitor is found in equation ??.

CV = Q

Inserting the given values of C = 5F and V = 5V, we find that:

Q = CV

= (5× 10−12F )(5V )

= 2,5× 10−11C

objects simultaneously, with only one connecting with the leader and forming

the main discharge path. Photographs have been taken on which

non-connected streamers are clearly visible. When the two leaders meet, the

electric current greatly increases. The region of high current propagates back

up the positive stepped leader into the cloud with a "return stroke" that is

the most luminous part of the lightning discharge.

3. Discharge When the electric field becomes strong enough, an electrical

discharge (the bolt of lightning) occurs within clouds or between clouds and

the ground. During the strike, successive portions of air become a conductive

discharge channel as the electrons and positive ions of air molecules are pulled

away from each other and forced to flow in opposite directions. The electrical

discharge rapidly superheats the discharge channel, causing the air to expand

rapidly and produce a shock wave heard as thunder. The rolling and gradually

dissipating rumble of thunder is caused by the time delay of sound coming

from different portions of a long stroke.

Important: Estimating distance of a lightning strike

The flash of a lightning strike and resulting thunder occur at roughly the same time. But light

travels at 300 000 kilometres in a second, almost a million times the speed of sound. Sound

travels at the slower speed of 330 m/s in the same time, so the flash of lightning is seen before

thunder is heard. By counting the seconds between the flash and the thunder and dividing by 3,

you can estimate your distance from the strike and initially the actual storm cell (in kilometres).
