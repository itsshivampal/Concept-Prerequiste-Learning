29.2 Capacitive and Inductive Circuits

Earlier in Grade 12, you were shown alternating currents (a.c.) and you saw that the voltage

and the current varied with time. If the a.c. supply is connected to a resistor, then the current

and voltage will be proportional to each other. This means that the current and voltage will

‘peak' at the same time. We say that the current and voltage are in phase. This is shown in

Figure 29.1.

When a capacitor is connected to an alternating voltage, the maximum voltage is proportional

to the maximum current, but the maximum voltage does not occur at the same time as the

maximum current. The current has its maximum (it peaks) one quarter of a cycle before the

voltage peaks. Engineers say that the ‘current leads the voltage by 90◦'. This is shown in

Figure 29.2.

For a circuit with a capacitor, the instantaneous value of V is not constant. However the value

I

of VmaxI is useful, and is called the capacitive reactance (XC) of the component. Because itmax

is still a voltage divided by a current (like resistance), its unit is the ohm. The value of XC (C

Inductors are very similar, but the current peaks 90◦ after the voltage. This is shown in
Figure 29.3. Engineers say that the ‘current lags the voltage'. Again, the ratio of maximum
voltage to maximum current is called the reactance - this time inductive reactance (XL).
The value of the reactance depends on its inductance (L).

Definition: Reactance
The ratio of the maximum voltage to the maximum current when a capacitor or inductor is
connected to an alternating voltage. The unit of reactance is the ohm.
While inductive and capacitive reactances are similar, in one sense they are opposites. For an
inductor, the current peaks 90◦ after the voltage. For a capacitor the current peaks 90◦ ahead
of the voltage. When we work out the total reactance for an inductor and a capacitor in series,
we use the formula
Xtotal = XL −XC (29.3)
to take this into account. This formula can also be used when there is more than one inductor
or more than one capacitor in the circuit. The total reactance is the sum of all of the inductive
reactances minus the sum of all the capacitive reactances. The magnitude (number) in the
final result gives the ratio of maximum voltage to maximum current in the circuit as a whole.
The sign of the final result tells you its phase. If it is positive, the current peaks 90◦ after the
voltage, if it is negative, the current peaks 90◦ before the voltage.

29.2 CHAPTER 29. ELECTRONICS - GRADE 12
If a series circuit contains resistors as well, then the situation is more complicated. The
maximum current is still proportional to the maximum voltage, but the phase difference
between them won't be 90◦. The ratio between the maximum voltage and maximum current is
called the impedance (Z), and its unit is als√o the ohm. Impedances are calculated using thisformula:
Z = X2 +R2 (29.4)
where X is the total reactance of the inductors and capacitors in the circuit, and R is the total
resistance of the resistors in the circuit.
It is easier to understand this formula by thinking of a right angled triangle. Resistances are
drawn horizontally, reactances are drawn vertically. The hypotenuse of the triangle gives the
impedance. This is shown in Figure 29.4.

Resistance R

Definition: Impedance
The maximum voltage divided by the maximum current for any circuit. The unit of
impedance is the ohm.
It is important to remember that when resistors and inductances (or capacitors) are in a circuit,
the current will not be in phase with the voltage, so the impedance is not a resistance.
Similarly the current won't be exactly 90◦ out of phase with the voltage so the impedance isn't
a reactance either.
Worked Example 179: The impedance of a coil
Question: Calculate the maximum current in a coil in a South African motor which
has a resistance of 5 Ω and an inductance of 3 mH. The maximum voltage across
the coil is 6 V. You can assume that the resistance and inductance are in series.
Answer
1. Calculate the reactance of the coil XL = 2πfL = 2π × 50× 0,003 = 0,942 Ω
2. Calcu√late the imped√ance of the coil

last question above. The current and voltage are then in phase again. We can't
