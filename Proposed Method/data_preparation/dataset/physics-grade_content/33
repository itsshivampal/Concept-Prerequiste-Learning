3.6.2 Motion at Constant Velocity

Motion at a constant velocity or uniform motion means that the position of the object is changing

at the same rate.

Assume that Lesedi takes 100 s to walk the 100 m to the taxi-stop every morning. If we assume

that Lesedi's house is the origin, then Lesedi's velocity is:

∆x

v =

∆t

xf − xi

=

tf − ti

100 m− 0 m

=

100 s− 0 s

= 1 m · s−1

Lesedi's velocity is 1 m·s−1. This means that he walked 1 m in the first second, another metre

in the second second, and another in the third second, and so on. For example, after 50 s he

will be 50 m from home. His position increases by 1 m every 1 s. A diagram of Lesedi's position

is shown in Figure 3.6.

We can now draw graphs of position vs.time (x vs. t), velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration

vs.time (a vs. t) for Lesedi moving at a constant velocity. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.7.

In the evening Lesedi walks 100 m from the bus stop to his house in 100 s. Assume that Lesedi's

house is the origin. The following graphs can be drawn to describe the motion.

We see that the v vs. t graph is a horisontal line. If the velocity vs. time graph is a horisontal

line, it means that the velocity is constant (not changing). Motion at a constant velocity is

known as uniform motion.

We can use the x vs. t to calculate the velocity by finding the gradient of the line.

Lesedi has a velocity of -1 m·s−1, or 1 m·s−1towards his house. You will notice that the v vs. t
graph is a horisontal line corresponding to a velocity of -1 m·s−1. The horisontal line means that
the velocity stays the same (remains constant) during the motion. This is uniform velocity.
We can use the v vs. t to calculate the acceleration by finding the gradient of the line.

Lesedi has an acceleration of 0 m·s−2. You will notice that the graph of a vs.t is a horisontal line
corresponding to an acceleration value of 0 m·s−2. There is no acceleration during the motion
because his velocity does not change.
We can use the v vs. t to calculate the displacement by finding the area under the graph.
v = Area under graph

= 100× (−1)
= −100 m
This means that Lesedi has a displacement of 100 m towards his house.

Activity :: Experiment : Motion at constant velocity
Aim:
To measure the position and time during motion at constant velocity and determine
the average velocity as the gradient of a "Position vs. Time" graph.
Apparatus:
A battery operated toy car, stopwatch, meter stick or measuring tape.
Method:
1. Work with a friend. Copy the table below into your workbook.
2. Complete the table by timing the car as it travels each distance.
3. Time the car twice for each distance and take the average value as your accepted
time.
4. Use the distance and average time values to plot a graph of "Distance vs. Time"
onto graph paper. Stick the graph paper into your workbook. (Remember
that "A vs. B" always means "y vs. x").
5. Insert all axis labels and units onto your graph.
6. Draw the best straight line through your data points.
7. Find the gradient of the straight line. This is the average velocity.
