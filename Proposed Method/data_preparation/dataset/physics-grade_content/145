10.2.1 Potential Difference

When a circuit is connected and is a complete circuit charge can move through the circuit.

Charge will not move unless there is a reason, a force. Think of it as though charge is at rest

and something has to push it along. This means that work needs to be done to make charge

move. A force acts on the charges, doing work, to make them move. The force is provided by

the battery in the circuit.

We call the moving charge "current" and we will talk about this later.

The position of the charge in the circuit tells you how much potential energy it has because of

the force being exerted on it. This is like the force from gravity, the higher an object is above

the ground (position) the more potential energy it has.

The amount of work to move a charge from one point to another point is how much the potential

energy has changed. This is the difference in potential energy, called potential difference. Notice

that it is a difference between the value of potential energy at two points so we say that potential

difference is measured between or across two points. We do not say potential difference through

something.

Definition: Potential Difference

Electrical potential difference as the difference in electrical potential energy per unit charge

between two points. The units of potential difference are the volt (V).

The units are volt (V), which is the same as joule per coulomb, the amount of work done per

unit charge. Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.

3.2 What happens when you close the switch? What does does this mean

about the circuit?

3.3 Draw the physical circuit.

Activity :: Discussion : Alternative Energy

At the moment, electric power is produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil.

In South Africa, our main source of electric power is coal burning power stations. (We

also have one nuclear power plant called Koeberg in the Western Cape). However,

burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of pollution into the earth's atmosphere

and can contribute to global warming. Also, the earth's fossil fuel reserves (especially

oil) are starting to run low. For these reasons, people all across the world are

working to find alternative/other sources of energy and on ways to conserve/save

energy. Other sources of energy include wind power, solar power (from the sun),

hydro-electric power (from water) among others.

With a partner, take out the lists you made earlier of the item/appliances/machines

which used electricity in the following environments. For each item, try to think of

an alternative AND a way to conserve or save power.

For example, if you had a flourescent light as an item used in the home, then:

• Alternative: use candles at supper time to reduce electricity consumption

• Conservation: turn off lights when not in a room, or during the day.

Topics:

• At home

• At school

• At the hospital

• In the city

Once you have finished making your lists, compare with the lists of other people in

your class.
