file_data: 1|What is Physics?|3
Physics is the study of the world around us. In a sense we are more qualified to do physics
than any other science. From the day we are born we study the things around us in an effort to
understand how they work and relate to each other. Learning how to catch or throw a ball is a
physics undertaking for example.
In the field of study we refer to as physics we just try to make the things everyone has been
studying more clear. We attempt to describe them through simple rules and mathematics.
Mathematics is merely the language we use.
The best approach to physics is to relate everything you learn to things you have already noticed
in your everyday life. Sometimes when you look at things closely you discover things you had
overlooked intially.
It is the continued scrutiny of everything we know about the world around us that leads people
to the lifelong study of physics. You can start with asking a simple question like ”Why is the sky
blue?” which could lead you to electromagnetic waves which in turn could lead you wave particle
duality and to energy levels of atoms and before long you are studying quantum mechanics or
the structure of the universe.
In the sections that follow notice that we will try to describe how we will communicate the things
we are dealing with. This is our langauge. Once this is done we can begin the adventure of
looking more closely at the world we live in.
/ntsDescriptions relating to these questions must be included: What is meant by a theory?
How does a hypothesis become part of a law?
(a) Define the term ”laboratory.” (b) How does your school’s physics laboratory fit this definition?
Distinguish between science and technology.

file_data: 2.1|Introduction|9
Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy fabric. The shop assistant would need
to know how much fabric you needed. Telling her you need fabric 2 wide and 6 long would be
insufficient — you have to specify the unit (i.e. 2 metres wide and 6 metres long). Without
the unit the information is incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were
making curtains for a doll’s house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide and 6 centimetres
long!
It is not just lengths that have units, all physical quantities have units (e.g. time, temperature,
distance, etc.).
Definition: Physical Quantity
A physical quantity is anything that you can measure. For example, length, temperature,
distance and time are physical quantities.

file_data: 2.2|Unit Systems|9


file_data: 2.2.1|SI Units|9
We will be using the SI units in this course. SI units are the internationally agreed upon units.
Historically these units are based on the metric system which was developed in France at the
time of the French Revolution.
Definition: SI Units
The name SI units comes from the French Syst`eme International d’Unit´es, which means
international system of units.
There are seven base SI units. These are listed in Table 2.1. All physical quantities have units
which can be built from these seven base units. These seven units were defined to be the base
units. So, it is possible to create a different set of units by defining a different set of base units.
These seven units are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations
of the other six. This is identical to bricks and concrete being the base units of a building. You
can build different things using different combinations of bricks and concrete. The 26 letters of
the alphabet are the base units for a language like English. Many different words can be formed
by using these letters.

file_data: 2.2.2|The Other Systems of Units|10
The SI Units are not the only units available, but they are most widely used. In Science there
are three other sets of units that can also be used. These are mentioned here for interest only.
c.g.s Units
In the c.g.s. system, the metre is replaced by the centimetre and the kilogram is replaced by the
gram. This is a simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed.
For example, the units of force and work are different. These units are used most often in
astrophysics and atomic physics.
Imperial Units
Imperial units arose when kings and queens decided the measures that were to be used in the
land. All the imperial base units, except for the measure of time, are different to those of SI
units. This is the unit system you are most likely to encounter if SI units are not used. Examples
of imperial units are pounds, miles, gallons and yards. These units are used by the Americans
and British. As you can imagine, having different units in use from place to place makes scientific
communication very difficult. This was the motivation for adopting a set of internationally agreed
upon units.
Natural Units
This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities
(such as the speed of light) are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other
quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high
energy physics and quantum mechanics.

file_data: 2.3|Writing Units as Words or Symbols|10
Unit names are always written with a lowercase first letter, for example, we write metre and litre.
The symbols or abbreviations of units are also written with lowercase initials, for example m for
metre and ℓ for litre. The exception to this rule is if the unit is named after a person, then the
symbol is a capital letter. For example, the kelvin was named after Lord Kelvin and its symbol is
K. If the abbreviation of the unit that is named after a person has two letters, the second letter
is lowercase, for example Hz for hertz.

file_data: 2.4|Combinations of SI Base Units|12
To make working with units easier, some combinations of the base units are given special names,
but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 2.2 lists some examples
of combinations of SI base units that are assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the
formulae look unfamiliar at this stage - we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as
well as many others)!
It is very important that you are able to recognise the units correctly. For instance, the new-
ton (N) is another name for the kilogram metre per second squared (kg·m·s−2), while the
kilogram metre squared per second squared (kg·m2 ·s−2) is called the joule (J).
Important: When writing combinations of base SI units, place a dot (·) between the units
to indicate that different base units are used. For example, the symbol for metres per second
is correctly written as m·s−1, and not as ms−1 or m/s.

file_data: 2.5|Rounding, Scientific Notation and Significant Figures|12


file_data: 2.5.1|Rounding Off|12
Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is
that impossible, but writing numbers out to a high accuracy (many decimal places) is very
inconvenient and rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number to a
certain number of decimal places. Rounding off or approximating a decimal number to a given
number of decimal places is the quickest way to approximate a number. For example, if you
wanted to round-off 2,6525272 to three decimal places then you would first count three places
after the decimal.
2,652|5272
All numbers to the right of | are ignored after you determine whether the number in the third
decimal place must be rounded up or rounded down. You round up the final digit (make the
digit one more) if the first digit after the | was greater or equal to 5 and round down (leave the
digit alone) otherwise. So, since the first digit after the | is a 5, we must round up the digit in
the third decimal place to a 3 and the final answer of 2,6525272 rounded to three decimal places
is 2,653.

file_data: 2.5.2|Error Margins|13
In a calculation that has many steps, it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end. For
example, Jack and Jill walks to school. They walk 0,9 kilometers to get to school and it takes
them 17 minutes. We can calculate their speed in the following two ways.
You will see that we get two different answers. In Method 1 no rounding was done, but in Method
2, the time was rounded to 2 decimal places. This made a big difference to the answer. The
answer in Method 1 is more accurate because rounded numbers were not used in the calculation.
Always only round off your final answer.

file_data: 2.5.3|Scientific Notation|13
In Science one often needs to work with very large or very small numbers. These can be written
more easily in scientific notation, in the general form
d × 10e
where d is a decimal number between 0 and 10 that is rounded off to a few decimal places. e is
known as the exponent and is an integer. If e > 0 it represents how many times the decimal
place in d should be moved to the right. If e < 0, then it represents how many times the decimal
place in d should be moved to the left. For example 3,24 × 103 represents 3240 (the decimal
moved three places to the right) and 3,24 × 10−3 represents 0,00324 (the decimal moved three
places to the left).
If a number must be converted into scientific notation, we need to work out how many times
the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it into a number between 1 and 10
(i.e. the value of e) and what this number between 1 and 10 is (the value of d). We do this by
counting the number of decimal places the decimal comma must move.
For example, write the speed of light in scientific notation, to two decimal places. The speed of
light is 299 792 458 m·s−1. First, find where the decimal comma must go for two decimal places
(to find d) and then count how many places there are after the decimal comma to determine e.
In this example, the decimal comma must go after the first 2, but since the number after the 9
is 7, d = 3,00. e = 8 because there are 8 digits left after the decimal comma. So the speed of
light in scientific notation, to two decimal places is 3,00 × 108 m·s−1.

file_data: 2.5.4|Significant Figures|15
In a number, each non-zero digit is a significant figure. Zeroes are only counted if they are
between two non-zero digits or are at the end of the decimal part. For example, the number
2000 has 1 significant figure (the 2), but 2000,0 has 5 significant figures. You estimate a number
like this by removing significant figures from the number (starting from the right) until you have
the desired number of significant figures, rounding as you go. For example 6,827 has 4 significant
figures, but if you wish to write it to 3 significant figures it would mean removing the 7 and
rounding up, so it would be 6,83.

file_data: 2.6|Prefixes of Base Units|15
Now that you know how to write numbers in scientific notation, another important aspect of
units is the prefixes that are used with the units.
Definition: Prefix
A prefix is a group of letters that are placed in front of a word. The effect of the prefix is to
change meaning of the word. For example, the prefix un is often added to a word to mean
not, as in unnecessary which means not necessary.
In the case of units, the prefixes have a special use. The kilogram (kg) is a simple example.
1 kg is equal to 1 000 g or 1 × 103 g. Grouping the 103 and the g together we can replace the
103 with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the 103.
The kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.
In Science, all the prefixes used with units are some power of 10. Table 2.4 lists some of
these prefixes. You will not use most of these prefixes, but those prefixes listed in bold should
be learnt. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the
table, it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents
less than one. For example M means mega (106) and m means milli (10−3).

file_data: 2.7|The Importance of Units|17
Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our
thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the numbers we measure and calculate. Depending
on which units we use, the numbers are different. For example if you have 12 water, it means
nothing. You could have 12 ml of water, 12 litres of water, or even 12 bottles of water. Units
are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be specified when expressing physical
quantities. Imagine that you are baking a cake, but the units, like grams and millilitres, for the
flour, milk, sugar and baking powder are not specified!

file_data: 2.8|How to Change Units|17
It is very important that you are aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, you
must be able to convert between units. Being able to change between units (for example,
converting from millimetres to metres) is a useful skill in Science.
If you want to change millimetre to metre, you divide by 1000 (follow the arrow from mm to m);
or if you want to change kilometre to millimetre, you multiply by 1000×1000.

file_data: 2.8.1|Two other useful conversions|19
Very often in Science you need to convert speed and temperature. The following two rules will
help you do this:
Converting speed
When converting km·h−1 to m·s−1you divide by 3,6. For example 72 km·h−1 ÷ 3,6 = 20 m·s−1.
When converting m·s−1to km·h−1, you multiply by 3,6. For example 30 m·s−1×3,6 = 108 km·h−1.
Converting temperature
Converting between the kelvin and celsius temperature scales is easy. To convert from celsius
to kelvin add 273. To convert from kelvin to celsius subtract 273. Representing the kelvin
temperature by TK and the celsius temperature by ToC,

file_data: 2.9|A sanity test|19
A sanity test is a method of checking whether an answer makes sense. All we have to do is to
take a careful look at our answer and ask the question Does the answer make sense?
Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was
1 000 000 people you would know it was wrong — it is not possible to have that many people
in a classroom. That is all a sanity test is — is your answer insane or not?
It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let us consider masses.
An average person has a mass around 70 kg, while the heaviest person in medical history had a
mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person’s mass and you get 7 000 kg, this should
fail your sanity check — your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere.
In the same way an answer of 0.01 kg should fail your sanity test.
The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are.
For example, finding the number of learners in a classroom you need to know that there are
usually 20–50 people in a classroom. If you get and answer of 2500, you should realise that it is
wrong.

file_data: 2.10|Summary|19


file_data: 2.11|End of Chapter Exercises|21


file_data: 3|Motion in One Dimension - Grade 10|23


file_data: 3.1|Introduction|23
This chapter is about how things move in a straight line or more scientifically how things move in
one dimension. This is useful for learning how to describe the movement of cars along a straight
road or of trains along straight railway tracks. If you want to understand how any object moves,
for example a car on the freeway, a soccer ball being kicked towards the goal or your dog chasing
the neighbour’s cat, then you have to understand three basic ideas about what it means when
something is moving. These three ideas describe different parts of exactly how an object moves.
They are:
1. position or displacement which tells us exactly where the object is,
2. speed or velocity which tells us exactly how fast the object’s position is changing or more
familiarly, how fast the object is moving, and
3. acceleration which tells us exactly how fast the object’s velocity is changing.
You will also learn how to use position, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration to describe
the motion of simple objects. You will learn how to read and draw graphs that summarise the
motion of a moving object. You will also learn about the equations that can be used to describe
motion and how to apply these equations to objects moving in one dimension.

file_data: 3.2|Reference Point, Frame of Reference and Position|23
The most important idea when studying motion, is you have to know where you are. The
word position describes your location (where you are). However, saying that you are here is
meaningless, and you have to specify your position relative to a known reference point. For
example, if you are 2 m from the doorway, inside your classroom then your reference point is
the doorway. This defines your position inside the classroom. Notice that you need a reference
point (the doorway) and a direction (inside) to define your location.

file_data: 3.2.1|Frames of Reference|23
Definition: Frame of Reference
A frame of reference is a reference point combined with a set of directions.
A frame of reference is similar to the idea of a reference point. A frame of reference is defined
as a reference point combined with a set of directions. For example, a boy is standing still inside a train as it pulls out of a station. You are standing on the platform watching the train move
from left to right. To you it looks as if the boy is moving from left to right, because relative
to where you are standing (the platform), he is moving. According to the boy, and his frame of
reference (the train), he is not moving.
A frame of reference must have an origin (where you are standing on the platform) and at least
a positive direction. The train was moving from left to right, making to your right positive and
to your left negative. If someone else was looking at the same boy, his frame of reference will
be different. For example, if he was standing on the other side of the platform, the boy will be
moving from right to left.

file_data: 3.2.2|Position|25
Definition: Position
Position is a measurement of a location, with reference to an origin.
A position is a measurement of a location, with reference to an origin. Positions can therefore be
negative or positive. The symbol x is used to indicate position. x has units of length for example
cm, m or km. Figure 3.2.2 shows the position of a school. Depending on what reference point
we choose, we can say that the school is 300 m from Joan’s house (with Joan’s house as the
reference point or origin) or 500 m from Joel’s house (with Joel’s house as the reference point
or origin).
The shop is also 300 m from Joan’s house, but in the opposite direction as the school. When
we choose a reference point, we have a positive direction and a negative direction. If we choose the direction towards the school as positive, then the direction towards the shop is negative. A
negative direction is always opposite to the direction chosen as positive.

file_data: 3.3|Displacement and Distance|28
Definition: Displacement
Displacement is the change in an object’s position.
The displacement of an object is defined as its change in position (final position minus initial
position). Displacement has a magnitude and direction and is therefore a vector. For example,
if the initial position of a car is xi and it moves to a final position of xf , then the displacement
is:
However, subtracting an initial quantity from a final quantity happens often in Physics, so we
use the shortcut to mean final - initial. Therefore, displacement can be written:
Important: The words initial and final will be used very often in Physics. Initial will always
refer to something that happened earlier in time and final will always refer to something
that happened later in time. It will often happen that the final value is smaller than the
initial value, such that the difference is negative. This is ok!
Displacement does not depend on the path travelled, but only on the initial and final positions
(Figure 3.4). We use the word distance to describe how far an object travels along a particular
path. Distance is the actual distance that was covered. Distance (symbol d) does not have a
direction, so it is a scalar. Displacement is the shortest distance from the starting point to the
endpoint – from the school to the shop in the figure. Displacement has direction and is therefore
a vector.
Figure 3.2.2 shows the five houses we discussed earlier. Jack walks to school, but instead of
walking straight to school, he decided to walk to his friend Joel’s house first to fetch him so that
they can walk to school together. Jack covers a distance of 400 m to Joel’s house and another
500 m to school. He covers a distance of 900 m. His displacement, however, is only 100 m
towards the school. This is because displacement only looks at the starting position (his house)
and the end position (the school). It does not depend on the path he travelled.
To calculate his distance and displacement, we need to choose a reference point and a direction.
Let’s choose Jack’s house as the reference point, and towards Joel’s house as the positive direc-
tion (which means that towards the school is negative). We would do the calculations as follows:
It is possible to have a displacement of 0 m and a distance that is not 0 m. This happens
when an object completes a round trip back to its original position, like an athlete running
around a track.

file_data: 3.3.1|Interpreting Direction|29
Very often in calculations you will get a negative answer. For example, Jack’s displacement in
the example above, is calculated as -100 m. The minus sign in front of the answer means that
his displacement is 100 m in the opposite direction (opposite to the direction chosen as positive
in the beginning of the question). When we start a calculation we choose a frame of reference
and a positive direction. In the first example above, the reference point is Jack’s house and the
positive direction is towards Joel’s house. Therefore Jack’s displacement is 100 m towards the
school. Notice that distance has no direction, but displacement has.


file_data: 3.3.2|Differences between Distance and Displacement|29
Definition: Vectors and Scalars
A vector is a physical quantity with magnitude (size) and direction. A scalar is a physical
quantity with magnitude (size) only.


file_data: 3.4|Speed, Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity|31
Definition: Velocity
Velocity is the rate of change of position.
Definition: Instantaneous velocity
Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an accelerating body at a specific instant in time.
Definition: Average velocity
Average velocity is the total displacement of a body over a time interval.
Velocity is the rate of change of position. It tells us how much an object’s position changes in
time. This is the same as the displacement divided by the time taken. Since displacement is a
vector and time taken is a scalar, velocity is also a vector. We use the symbol v for velocity. If
we have a displacement of x and a time taken of t, v is then defined as:
Velocity can be positive or negative. Positive values of velocity mean that the object is moving
away from the reference point or origin and negative values mean that the object is moving
towards the reference point or origin.
Important: An instant in time is different from the time taken or the time interval. It
is therefore useful to use the symbol t for an instant in time (for example during the 4th
second) and the symbol t for the time taken (for example during the first 5 seconds of
the motion).
Average velocity (symbol v) is the displacement for the whole motion divided by the time taken
for the whole motion. Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific instant in time.
(Average) Speed (symbol s) is the distance travelled (d) divided by the time taken (t) for
the journey. Distance and time are scalars and therefore speed will also be a scalar. Speed is
calculated as follows:
Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. It has the same value, but no
direction.


file_data: 3.4.1|Differences between Speed and Velocity|35
The differences between speed and velocity can be summarised as:
Speed
1. depends on the path taken 
2. always positive 
3. is a scalar 
4. no dependence on direction and
so is only positive

Velocity
1. independent of path taken
2. can be positive or negative
3. is a vector
4. direction can be guessed from the sign (i.e. positive or negative)
Additionally, an object that makes a round trip, i.e. travels away from its starting point and then
returns to the same point has zero velocity but travels a non-zero speed.


file_data: 3.5|Acceleration|38
Definition: Acceleration
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
Acceleration (symbol a) is the rate of change of velocity. It is a measure of how fast the velocity
of an object changes in time. If we have a change in velocity (v) over a time interval (t),
then the acceleration (a) is defined as:
Since velocity is a vector, acceleration is also a vector. Acceleration does not provide any infor-
mation about a motion, but only about how the motion changes. It is not possible to tell how
fast an object is moving or in which direction from the acceleration.
Like velocity, acceleration can be negative or positive. We see that when the sign of the acceler-
ation and the velocity are the same, the object is speeding up. If both velocity and acceleration
are positive, the object is speeding up in a positive direction. If both velocity and acceleration
are negative, the object is speeding up in a negative direction. If velocity is positive and accel-
eration is negative, then the object is slowing down. Similarly, if the velocity is negative and the
acceleration is positive the object is slowing down. This is illustrated in the following worked
example.
Important: Acceleration does not tell us about the direction of the motion. Acceleration
only tells us how the velocity changes.
Important: Deceleration
Avoid the use of the word deceleration to refer to a negative acceleration. This word usually
means slowing down and it is possible for an object to slow down with both a positive and
negative acceleration, because the sign of the velocity of the object must also be taken into
account to determine whether the body is slowing down or not.


file_data: 3.6|Description of Motion|39
The purpose of this chapter is to describe motion, and now that we understand the definitions of
displacement, distance, velocity, speed and acceleration, we are ready to start using these ideas
to describe how an object is moving. There are many ways of describing motion:
1. words
2. diagrams
3. graphs
These methods will be described in this section.
We will consider three types of motion: when the object is not moving (stationary object), when
the object is moving at a constant velocity (uniform motion) and when the object is moving at
a constant acceleration (motion at constant acceleration).


file_data: 3.6.1|Stationary Object|40
The simplest motion that we can come across is that of a stationary object. A stationary object
does not move and so its position does not change, for as long as it is standing still. An example
of this situation is when someone is waiting for something without moving. The person remains
in the same position.
Lesedi is waiting for a taxi. He is standing two metres from a stop street at t = 0 s. After
one minute, at t = 60 s, he is still 2 metres from the stop street and after two minutes, at
t = 120 s, also 2 metres from the stop street. His position has not changed. His displacement
is zero (because his position is the same), his velocity is zero (because his displacement is zero)
and his acceleration is also zero (because his velocity is not changing).
We can now draw graphs of position vs.time (x vs. t), velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration
vs.time (a vs. t) for a stationary object. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.5. Lesedi’s position
is 2 metres from the stop street. If the stop street is taken as the reference point, his position
remains at 2 metres for 120 seconds. The graph is a horisontal line at 2 m. The velocity and
acceleration graphs are also shown. They are both horisontal lines on the x-axis. Since his
position is not changing, his velocity is 0 m·s−1and since velocity is not changing acceleration is
0 m·s−2.
Definition: Gradient
The gradient of a line can be calculated by dividing the change in the y-value by the change
in the x-value.
m = y
x
Since we know that velocity is the rate of change of position, we can confirm the value for the
velocity vs. time graph, by calculating the gradient of the x vs. t graph.

file_data: 3.6.2|Motion at Constant Velocity|41
Motion at a constant velocity or uniform motion means that the position of the object is changing
at the same rate.
Assume that Lesedi takes 100 s to walk the 100 m to the taxi-stop every morning. If we assume
that Lesedi’s house is the origin, then Lesedi’s velocity is:
Lesedi’s velocity is 1 m·s−1. This means that he walked 1 m in the first second, another metre
in the second second, and another in the third second, and so on. For example, after 50 s he
will be 50 m from home. His position increases by 1 m every 1 s. A diagram of Lesedi’s position
is shown in Figure 3.6.
We can now draw graphs of position vs.time (x vs. t), velocity vs.time (v vs. t) and acceleration
vs.time (a vs. t) for Lesedi moving at a constant velocity. The graphs are shown in Figure 3.7.
In the evening Lesedi walks 100 m from the bus stop to his house in 100 s. Assume that Lesedi’s
house is the origin. The following graphs can be drawn to describe the motion.
We see that the v vs. t graph is a horisontal line. If the velocity vs. time graph is a horisontal
line, it means that the velocity is constant (not changing). Motion at a constant velocity is
known as uniform motion.
We can use the x vs. t to calculate the velocity by finding the gradient of the line.
Lesedi has a velocity of -1 m·s−1, or 1 m·s−1towards his house. You will notice that the v vs. t
graph is a horisontal line corresponding to a velocity of -1 m·s−1. The horisontal line means that
the velocity stays the same (remains constant) during the motion. This is uniform velocity.



file_data: 3.6.3|Motion at Constant Acceleration|46
The final situation we will be studying is motion at constant acceleration. We know that
acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So, if we have a constant acceleration, this
means that the velocity changes at a constant rate.
Let’s look at our first example of Lesedi waiting at the taxi stop again. A taxi arrived and Lesedi
got in. The taxi stopped at the stop street and then accelerated as follows: After 1 s the taxi
covered a distance of 2,5 m, after 2 s it covered 10 m, after 3 seconds it covered 22,5 m and
after 4 s it covered 40 m. The taxi is covering a larger distance every second. This means that
it is accelerating.
The acceleration does not change during the motion (the gradient stays constant). This is
motion at constant or uniform acceleration.
The graphs for this situation are shown in Figure 3.9.
Velocity from Acceleration vs. Time Graphs
Just as we used velocity vs. time graphs to find displacement, we can use acceleration vs. time
graphs to find the velocity of an object at a given moment in time. We simply calculate the
area under the acceleration vs. time graph, at a given time. In the graph below, showing an
object at a constant positive acceleration, the increase in velocity of the object after 2 seconds
corresponds to the shaded portion.
The velocity of the object at t = 2 s is therefore 10 m·s−1. This corresponds with the values
obtained in Figure 3.9.

file_data: 3.7|Summary of Graphs|48
Important: Often you will be required to describe the motion of an object that is presented
as a graph of either position, velocity or acceleration as functions of time. The description
of the motion represented by a graph should include the following (where possible):
1. whether the object is moving in the positive or negative direction
2. whether the object is at rest, moving at constant velocity or moving at constant
positive acceleration (speeding up) or constant negative acceleration (slowing down)
You will also often be required to draw graphs based on a description of the motion in words
or from a diagram. Remember that these are just different methods of presenting the same
information. If you keep in mind the general shapes of the graphs for the different types of
motion, there should not be any difficulty with explaining what is happening.


file_data: 3.8|Worked Examples|49


file_data: 3.9|Equations of Motion|54
In this chapter we will look at the third way to describe motion. We have looked at describing
motion in terms of graphs and words. In this section we examine equations that can be used to
describe motion.
This section is about solving problems relating to uniformly accelerated motion. In other words,
motion at constant acceleration.
The questions can vary a lot, but the following method for answering them will always work.
Use this when attempting a question that involves motion with constant acceleration. You need
any three known quantities (vi, vf , x, t or a) to be able to calculate the fourth one.
1. Read the question carefully to identify the quantities that are given. Write them down.
2. Identify the equation to use. Write it down!!!
3. Ensure that all the values are in the correct unit and fill them in your equation.
4. Calculate the answer and fill in its unit.
Galileo Galilei of Pisa, Italy, was the first to determined the correct mathematical
law for acceleration: the total distance covered, starting from rest, is proportional
to the square of the time. He also concluded that objects retain their velocity
unless a force – often friction – acts upon them, refuting the accepted Aristotelian
hypothesis that objects ”naturally” slow down and stop unless a force acts upon
them. This principle was incorporated into Newton’s laws of motion (1st law).

What we have learnt in this chapter can be directly applied to road safety. We can analyse the
relationship between speed and stopping distance. The following worked example illustrates this
application.

file_data: 4|Gravity and Mechanical Energy - Grade 10|67


file_data: 4.1|Weight|67
Weight is the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on any object. The weight of an objects
gives you an indication of how strongly the Earth attracts that body towards its centre. Weight
is calculated as follows:
Weight = mg
where m = mass of the object (in kg)
and g = the acceleration due to gravity (9,8 m·s−2)
Important: Weight is sometimes abbreviated as Fg which refers to the force of gravity. Do
not use the abbreviation ’W’ for weight as it refers to ’Work’.
Now, we have said that the value of g is approximately 9,8 m·s−2on the surface of the Earth.
The actual value varies slightly over the surface of the Earth. Each planet in our Solar System
has its own value for g. These values are listed as multiples of g on Earth in Table 4.1


file_data: 4.1.1|Differences between Mass and Weight|68
Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is the amount of matter in an object. An object’s mass
does not change unless matter is added or removed from the object.
The differences between mass and weight can be summarised in the following table:
Mass 
1. is a measure of how many molecules there are in an object.
2. is measured in kilograms. 
3. is the same on any planet. 
4. is a scalar. 
Weight
1. is the force with which the Earth attracts an object.
2. is measured in newtons
3. is different on different planets.
4. is a vector.

file_data: 4.2|Acceleration due to Gravity|69


file_data: 4.2.1|Gravitational Fields|69
A field is a region of space in which a mass experiences a force. Therefore, a gravitational field
is a region of space in which a mass experiences a gravitational force.

file_data: 4.2.2|Free fall|69
Important: Free fall is motion in the Earth’s gravitational field when no other forces act
on the object.
Free fall is the term used to describe a special kind of motion in the Earth’s gravitational field.
Free fall is motion in the Earth’s gravitational field when no other forces act on the object. It
is basically an ideal situation, since in reality, there is always some air friction which slows down
the motion.
If a metal ball and tennis ball (of the same size) were dropped from the same height, both would
reach the ground at the same time. It does not matter that the one ball is heavier than the
other. The acceleration of an object due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object. It
does not matter what the mass of the object is.
The shape of the object, however, is important. The sheet of paper took much longer to reach
the ground than the tennis ball. This is because the effect of air friction on the paper was much
greater than the air friction on the tennis ball.
If we lived in a world where there was no air resistance, the A4 sheet of paper and the tennis
ball would reach the ground at the same time. This happens in outer space or in a vaccuum.
Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist, studied the motion of objects. The following case study will
tell you more about one of his investigations.


file_data: 4.3|Potential Energy|73
The potential energy of an object is generally defined as the energy an object has because of
its position relative to other objects that it interacts with. There are different kinds of potential
energy such as gravitional potential energy, chemical potential energy, electrical potential energy,
to name a few. In this section we will be looking at gravitational potential energy.
Definition: Potential energy
Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.
Gravitational potential energy is the energy of an object due to its position above the surface of
the Earth. The symbol PE is used to refer to gravitational potential energy. You will often find
that the words potential energy are used where gravitational potential energy is meant. We can
define potential energy (or gravitational potential energy, if you like) as:
PE = mgh (4.5)
where PE = potential energy measured in joules (J)
m = mass of the object (measured in kg)
g = gravitational acceleration (9,8 m·s−2)
h = perpendicular height from the reference point (measured in m)
A suitcase, with a mass of 1 kg, is placed at the top of a 2 m high cupboard. By lifting the
suitcase against the force of gravity, we give the suitcase potential energy. This potential energy
can be calculated using equation 4.5.
If the suitcase falls off the cupboard, it will lose its potential energy. Halfway down the cupboard,
the suitcase will have lost half its potential energy and will have only 9,8 J left. At the bottom
of the cupboard the suitcase will have lost all it’s potential energy and it’s potential energy will
be equal to zero.
Objects have maximum potential energy at a maximum height and will lose their potential
energy as they fall.


file_data: 4.4|Kinetic Energy|75
Definition: Kinetic Energy
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion.
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion. This means that any moving
object has kinetic energy. The faster it moves, the more kinetic energy it has. Kinetic energy
(KE) is therefore dependent on the velocity of the object. The mass of the object also plays a role. A truck of 2000 kg, moving at 100 km·hr−1, will have more kinetic energy than a car of
500 kg, also moving at 100 km·hr−1. Kinetic energy is defined as:
Consider the 1 kg suitcase on the cupboard that was discussed earlier. When the suitcase falls, it
will gain velocity (fall faster), until it reaches the ground with a maximum velocity. The suitcase
will not have any kinetic energy when it is on top of the cupboard because it is not moving.
Once it starts to fall it will gain kinetic energy, because it gains velocity. Its kinetic energy will
increase until it is a maximum when the suitcase reaches the ground.

file_data: 4.4.1|Checking units|77
According to the equation for kinetic energy, the unit should be kg·m2 ·s−2. We can prove that
this unit is equal to the joule, the unit for energy.


file_data: 4.5|Mechanical Energy|78
Important: Mechanical energy is the sum of the gravitational potential energy and the
kinetic energy.
Mechanical energy, U, is simply the sum of gravitational potential energy (PE) and the kinetic
energy (KE). Mechanical energy is defined as:


file_data: 4.5.1|Conservation of Mechanical Energy|78
The Law of Conservation of Energy states:
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but is merely changed from one form into
another.
Definition: Conservation of Energy
The Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but is merely
changed from one form into another.
So far we have looked at two types of energy: gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy.
The sum of the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy is called the mechanical energy.
In a closed system, one where there are no external forces acting, the mechanical energy will
remain constant. In other words, it will not change (become more or less). This is called the
Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy and it states:
The total amount of mechanical energy in a closed system remains constant.
Definition: Conservation of Mechanical Energy
Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy: The total amount of mechanical energy in a
closed system remains constant.
This means that potential energy can become kinetic energy, or vise versa, but energy cannot
’dissappear’. The mechanical energy of an object moving in the Earth’s gravitational field (or
accelerating as a result of gravity) is constant or conserved, unless external forces, like air
resistance, acts on the object.
We can now use the conservation of mechanical energy to calculate the velocity of a body in
freefall and show that the velocity is independent of mass.
Important: In problems involving the use of conservation of energy, the path taken by
the object can be ignored. The only important quantities are the object’s velocity (which
gives its kinetic energy) and height above the reference point (which gives its gravitational
potential energy).
Important: In the absence of friction, mechanical energy is conserved and
Ubefore = Uafter
In the presence of friction, mechanical energy is not conserved. The mechanical energy lost
is equal to the work done against friction.
U = Ubefore − Uafter = work done against friction
In general mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of external forces. Examples of external
forces are: applied forces, frictional forces, air resistance, tension, normal forces.
In the presence of internal forces like the force due to gravity or the force in a spring, mechanical
energy is conserved.

file_data: 4.5.2|Using the Law of Conservation of Energy|79
Mechanical energy is conserved (in the absence of friction). Therefore we can say that the sum
of the PE and the KE anywhere during the motion must be equal to the sum of the PE and
the KE anywhere else in the motion.
We can now apply this to the example of the suitcase on the cupboard. Consider the mechanical
energy of the suitcase at the top and at the bottom. We can say:
The suitcase will strike the ground with a velocity of 6,26 m·s−1.
From this we see that when an object is lifted, like the suitcase in our example, it gains potential
energy. As it falls back to the ground, it will lose this potential energy, but gain kinetic en-
ergy. We know that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form into
another. In our example, the potential energy that the suitcase loses is changed to kinetic energy.
The suitcase will have maximum potential energy at the top of the cupboard and maximum
kinetic energy at the bottom of the cupboard. Halfway down it will have half kinetic energy and
half potential energy. As it moves down, the potential energy will be converted (changed) into
kinetic energy until all the potential energy is gone and only kinetic energy is left. The 19,6 J of
potential energy at the top will become 19,6 J of kinetic energy at the bottom.


file_data: 4.6|Energy graphs|82
Let us consider our example of the suitcase on the cupboard, once more.
Let’s look at each of these quantities and draw a graph for each. We will look at how each
quantity changes as the suitcase falls from the top to the bottom of the cupboard.
• Potential energy: The potential energy starts off at a maximum and decreases until it
reaches zero at the bottom of the cupboard. It had fallen a distance of 2 metres.
Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy is zero at the start of the fall. When the suitcase
reaches the ground, the kinetic energy is a miximum. We also use distance on the x-axis.
Mechanical energy: The mechanical energy is constant throughout the motion and is
always a maximum. At any point in time, when we add the potential energy and the
kinetic energy, we will get the same number.

file_data: 4.7|Summary|83


file_data: 4.8|End of Chapter Exercises: Gravity and Mechanical Energy|84


file_data: 5|Transverse Pulses - Grade 10|87


file_data: 5.1|Introduction|87
This chapter forms the basis of the discussion into mechanical waves. Waves are all around us,
even though most of us are not aware of it. The most common waves are waves in the sea, but
waves can be created in any container of water, ranging from an ocean to a tea-cup. Simply, a
wave is moving energy.

file_data: 5.2|What is a medium?|87
In this chapter, as well as in the following chapters, we will speak about waves moving in a
medium. A medium is just the substance or material through which waves move. In other words
the medium carries the wave from one place to another. The medium does not create the wave
and the medium is not the wave. Air is a medium for sound waves, water is a medium for water
waves and rock is a medium for earthquakes (which are also a type of wave). Air, water and
rock are therefore examples of media (media is the plural of medium).
Definition: Medium
A medium is the substance or material in which a wave will move.
In each medium, the atoms that make up the medium are moved temporarily from their rest
position. In order for a wave to travel, the different parts of the medium must be able to interact
with each other.

file_data: 5.3|What is a pulse?|87
In the activity, we created a pulse. A pulse is a single disturbance that moves through a
medium. A transverse pulse moves perpendicular to the medium. Figure 5.1 shows an example
of a transverse pulse. In the activity, the rope or spring was held horizontally and the pulse
moved the rope up and down. This was an example of a transverse pulse.
Definition: Pulse
A pulse is a single disturbance that moves through a medium.


file_data: 5.3.1|Pulse Length and Amplitude|88
The amplitude of a pulse is a measurement of how far the medium is displaced from a position
of rest. The pulse length is a measurement of how long the pulse is. Both these quantities are
shown in Figure 5.1.
Definition: Amplitude
The amplitude of a pulse is a measurement of how far the medium is displaced from rest.
In the activity, we found that the values for how high the pulse (a) is and how wide the pulse
(p) is the same at different times. Pulse length and amplitude are two important quantities of
a pulse.

file_data: 5.3.2|Pulse Speed|89
Definition: Pulse Speed
Pulse speed is the distance a pulse travels in a specific time.
In Chapter 3 we saw that speed was defined as the distance travelled in a specified time. We
can use the same definition of speed to calculate how fast a pulse travels. If the pulse travels a
distance d in a time t, then the pulse speed v is:
Important: The pulse speed depends on the properties of the medium and not on the
amplitude or pulse length of the pulse.


file_data: 5.4|Graphs of Position and Velocity|90
When a pulse moves through a medium, there are two different motions: the motion of the
particles of the medium and the motion of the pulse. These two motions are at right angles to
each other when the pulse is transverse. Each motion will be discussed.
Consider the situation shown in Figure ??. The dot represents one particle of the medium. We
see that as the pulse moves to the right the particle only moves up and down.


file_data: 5.4.1|Motion of a Particle of the Medium|90
First we consider the motion of a particle of the medium when a pulse moves through the
medium. For the explanation we will zoom into the medium so that we are looking at the atoms
of the medium. These atoms are connected to each other as shown in Figure 5.2.
When a pulse moves through the medium, the particles in the medium only move up and down.
We can see this in the figure below which shows the motion of a single particle as a pulse moves
through the medium.
Important: A particle in the medium only moves up and down when a transverse pulse
moves through the medium. The pulse moves from left to right (or right to left). The
motion of the particle is perpendicular to the motion of a transverse pulse.
If you consider the motion of the particle as a function of time, you can draw a graph of position
vs. time and velocity vs. time.

file_data: 5.4.2|Motion of the Pulse|92
The motion of the pulse is much simpler than the motion of a particle in the medium.
Important: A point on a transverse pulse, eg. the peak, only moves in the direction of the
motion of the pulse.

file_data: 5.5|Transmission and Reflection of a Pulse at a Boundary|96
What happens when a pulse travelling in one medium finds that medium is joined to another?
When a pulse meets a boundary between two media, part of the pulse is reflected and part of it
is transmitted. You will see that in the thin rope the pulse moves back (is reflected). The pulse
is also passed on (transmitted) to the thick rope and it moves away from the boundary.
When a pulse is transmitted from one medium to another, like from a thin rope to a thicker one,
the pulse will change where it meets the boundary of the two mediums (for example where the
ropes are joined). When a pulse moves from a thin rope to a thicker one, the speed of the pulse
will decrease. The pulse will move slower and the pulse length will increase.
When a pulse moves from a thick rope to a thinner one, the opposite happens. The pulse speed
will increase and the pulse length will decrease.
When the speed of the pulse increases, the pulse length will decrease. If the speed decreases,
the pulse length will increase. The incident pulse is the one that arrives at the boundary. The
reflected pulse is the one that moves back, away from the boundary. The transmitted pulse
is the one that moves into the new medium, away from the boundary.


file_data: 5.6|Reflection of a Pulse from Fixed and Free Ends|97
Let us now consider what happens to a pulse when it reaches the end of a medium. The medium
can be fixed, like a rope tied to a wall, or it can be free, like a rope tied loosely to a pole.


file_data: 5.6.1|Reflection of a Pulse from a Fixed End|97
When the end of the medium is fixed, for example a rope tied to a wall, a pulse reflects from
the fixed end, but the pulse is inverted (i.e. it is upside-down). This is shown in Figure 5.9.

file_data: 5.6.2|Reflection of a Pulse from a Free End|98
When the end of the medium is free, for example a rope tied loosely to a pole, a pulse reflects
from the free end, but the pulse is not inverted. This is shown in Figure 5.10. We draw the
free end as a ring around the pole. The ring will move up and down the pole, while the pulse is
reflected away from the pole.
Important: The fixed and free ends that were discussed in this section are examples of
boundary conditions. You will see more of boundary conditions as you progress in the
Physics syllabus.


file_data: 5.7|Superposition of Pulses|99
Two or more pulses can pass through the same medium at that same time. The resulting pulse
is obtained by using the principle of superposition. The principle of superposition states that the
effect of the pulses is the sum of their individual effects. After pulses pass through each other,
each pulse continues along its original direction of travel, and their original amplitudes remain
unchanged.
Constructive interference takes place when two pulses meet each other to create a larger pulse.
The amplitude of the resulting pulse is the sum of the amplitudes of the two initial pulses. This
is shown in Figure 5.11.
Definition: Constructive interference is when two pulses meet, resulting in a bigger
pulse.
Destructive interference takes place when two pulses meet and cancel each other. The amplitude
of the resulting pulse is the sum of the amplitudes of the two initial pulses, but the one amplitude
will be a negative number. This is shown in Figure 5.12. In general, amplitudes of individual
pulses add together to give the amplitude of the resultant pulse.
Definition: Destructive interference is when two pulses meet, resulting in a smaller
pulse.

file_data: 5.8|Exercises - Transverse Pulses|102




file_data: 6|Transverse Waves - Grade 10|105


file_data: 6.1|Introduction|105
Waves occur frequently in nature. The most obvious examples are waves in water, on a dam, in
the ocean, or in a bucket. We are most interested in the properties that waves have. All waves
have the same properties, so if we study waves in water, then we can transfer our knowledge to
predict how other examples of waves will behave.

file_data: 6.2|What is a transverse wave?|105
We have studied pulses in Chapter 5, and know that a pulse is a single disturbance that travels
through a medium. A wave is a periodic, continuous disturbance that consists of a train of
pulses.
Definition: Wave
A wave is a periodic, continuous disturbance that consists of a train of pulses.
Definition: Transverse wave
A transverse wave is a wave where the movement of the particles of the medium is perpen-
dicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.
In the Activity, you have created waves. The medium through which these waves propagated
was the rope, which is obviously made up of a very large number of particles (atoms). From the
activity, you would have noticed that the wave travelled from left to right, but the particles (the
ribbon) moved only up and down.
When the particles of a medium move at right angles to the direction of propagation of a wave,
the wave is called transverse. For waves, there is no net displacement of the particles (they
return to their equilibrium position), but there is a net displacement of the wave. There are thus
two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave.

file_data: 6.2.1|Peaks and Troughs|106
Waves consist of moving peaks (or crests) and troughs. A peak is the highest point the medium
rises to and a trough is the lowest point the medium sinks to.
Peaks and troughs on a transverse wave are shown in Figure 6.2.
Definition: Peaks and troughs
A peak is a point on the wave where the displacement of the medium is at a maximum.
A point on the wave is a trough if the displacement of the medium at that point is at a
minimum.

file_data: 6.2.2|Amplitude and Wavelength|107
There are a few properties that we saw with pulses that also apply to waves. These are amplitude
and wavelength (we called this pulse length).
Definition: Amplitude
The amplitude is the maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position.
As we have seen in the activity on amplitude, the distance between the peak and the equilibrium
position is equal to the distance between the trough and the equilibrium position. This distance
is known as the amplitude of the wave, and is the characteristic height of wave, above or below
the equilibrium position. Normally the symbol A is used to represent the amplitude of a wave.
The SI unit of amplitude is the metre (m).
As we have seen in the activity on wavelength, the distance between two adjacent peaks is the
same no matter which two adjacent peaks you choose. There is a fixed distance between the
peaks. Similarly, we have seen that there is a fixed distance between the troughs, no matter
which two troughs you look at. More importantly, the distance between two adjacent peaks is
the same as the distance between two adjacent troughs. This distance is call the wavelength of
the wave.
The symbol for the wavelength is λ (the Greek letter lambda) and wavelength is measured in
metres (m).

file_data: 6.2.3|Points in Phase|109
In the activity the distance between the indicated points was the same. These points are then
said to be in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an integer (0,1,2,3,...) number of
complete wave cycles. They do not have to be peaks or troughs, but they must be separated by
a complete number of wavelengths.
We then have an alternate definition of the wavelength as the distance between any two adjacent
points which are in phase.
Definition: Wavelength of wave
The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two adjacent points that are in phase.
Points that are not in phase, those that are not separated by a complete number of wavelengths,
are called out of phase. Examples of points like these would be A and C, or D and E, or B and
H in the Activity.

file_data: 6.2.4|Period and Frequency|110
Imagine you are sitting next to a pond and you watch the waves going past you. First one peak
arrives, then a trough, and then another peak. Suppose you measure the time taken between
one peak arriving and then the next. This time will be the same for any two successive peaks
passing you. We call this time the period, and it is a characteristic of the wave.
The symbol T is used to represent the period. The period is measured in seconds (s).
Definition: The period (T) is the time taken for two successive peaks (or troughs)
to pass a fixed point.
Imagine the pond again. Just as a peak passes you, you start your stopwatch and count each
peak going past. After 1 second you stop the clock and stop counting. The number of peaks
that you have counted in the 1 second is the frequency of the wave.
Definition: The frequency is the number of successive peaks (or troughs) passing a
given point in 1 second.
The frequency and the period are related to each other. As the period is the time taken for
1 peak to pass, then the number of peaks passing the point in 1 second is 1
T . But this is the
frequency. So


file_data: 6.2.5|Speed of a Transverse Wave|111
In Chapter 3, we saw that speed was defined as
speed =
distance travelled
time taken
.
The distance between two successive peaks is 1 wavelength, λ. Thus in a time of 1 period, the
wave will travel 1 wavelength in distance. Thus the speed of the wave, v, is:
v =
distance travelled
time taken
=
λ
T
.
However, f = 1
T . Therefore, we can also write:
v =
λ
T
= λ ·
1
T
= λ · f
We call this equation the wave equation. To summarise, we have that v = λ · f where


file_data: 6.3|Graphs of Particle Motion|115
In Chapter 5, we saw that when a pulse moves through a medium, there are two different motions:
the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the pulse. These two motions are
at right angles to each other when the pulse is transverse. Since a transverse wave is a series of
transverse pulses, the particle in the medium and the wave move in exactly the same way as for
the pulse.
When a transverse wave moves through the medium, the particles in the medium only move up
and down. We can see this in the figure below, which shows the motion of a single particle as a
transverse wave moves through the medium.
As in Chapter 3, we can draw a graph of the particles’ position as a function of time. For the
wave shown in the above figure, we can draw the graph shown below.
The graph of the particle’s velocity as a function of time is obtained by taking the gradient of
the position vs. time graph. The graph of velocity vs. time for the position vs. time graph
above, is shown in the graph below.
The graph of the particle’s acceleration as a function of time is obtained by taking the gradient
of the velocity vs. time graph. The graph of acceleration vs. time for the position vs. time
graph shown above, is shown below.
As for motion in one dimension, these graphs can be used to describe the motion of the particle.
This is illustrated in the worked examples below.



file_data: 6.4|Standing Waves and Boundary Conditions|118


file_data: 6.4.1|Reflection of a Transverse Wave from a Fixed End|118
We have seen that when a pulse meets a fixed endpoint, the pulse is reflected, but it is inverted.
Since a transverse wave is a series of pulses, a transverse wave meeting a fixed endpoint is also
reflected and the reflected wave is inverted. That means that the peaks and troughs are swapped
around.

file_data: 6.4.2|Reflection of a Transverse Wave from a Free End|118
If transverse waves are reflected from an end, which is free to move, the waves sent down the
string are reflected but do not suffer a phase shift as shown in Figure 6.4.

file_data: 6.4.3|Standing Waves|118
What happens when a reflected transverse wave meets an incident transverse wave? When two
waves move in opposite directions, through each other, interference takes place. If the two waves
have the same frequency and wavelength then standing waves are generated.
Standing waves are so-called because they appear to be standing still.
We can now look closely how standing waves are formed. Figure 6.5 shows a reflected wave
meeting an incident wave.
When they touch, both waves have an amplitude of zero:
Figure 6.6: A reflected wave (solid line) meets the incident wave (dashed line).
If we wait for a short time the ends of the two waves move past each other and the waves
overlap. To find the resultant wave, we add the two together.
Figure 6.7: A reflected wave (solid line) overlaps slightly with the incident wave (dashed line).
In this picture, we show the two waves as dotted lines and the sum of the two in the overlap
region is shown as a solid line:
The important thing to note in this case is that there are some points where the two waves
always destructively interfere to zero. If we let the two waves move a little further we get the
picture below:
Again we have to add the two waves together in the overlap region to see what the sum of the
waves looks like.
In this case the two waves have moved half a cycle past each other but because they are out of
phase they cancel out completely.
When the waves have moved past each other so that they are overlapping for a large region
the situation looks like a wave oscillating in place. The following sequence of diagrams show
what the resulting wave will look like. To make it clearer, the arrows at the top of the picture
show peaks where maximum positive constructive interference is taking place. The arrows at
the bottom of the picture show places where maximum negative interference is taking place.
As time goes by the peaks become smaller and the troughs become shallower but they do not
move.
For an instant the entire region will look completely flat.
The various points continue their motion in the same manner.
Eventually the picture looks like the complete reflection through the x-axis of what we started
with:
Then all the points begin to move back. Each point on the line is oscillating up and down with
a different amplitude.
If we look at the overall result, we get a standing wave.
Figure 6.8: A standing wave
If we superimpose the two cases where the peaks were at a maximum and the case where the
same waves were at a minimum we can see the lines that the points oscillate between. We call
this the envelope of the standing wave as it contains all the oscillations of the individual points.
To make the concept of the envelope clearer let us draw arrows describing the motion of points
along the line.
Every point in the medium containing a standing wave oscillates up and down and the amplitude
of the oscillations depends on the location of the point. It is convenient to draw the envelope
for the oscillations to describe the motion. We cannot draw the up and down arrows for every
single point!
Interesting Fact
Standing waves can be a problem in for example indoor concerts where the
dimensions of the concert venue coincide with particular wavelengths. Standing
waves can appear as ‘feedback’, which would occur if the standing wave was
picked up by the microphones on stage and amplified.

file_data: 6.4.4|Nodes and anti-nodes|122
A node is a point on a wave where no displacement takes place. In a standing wave, a node
is a place where the two waves cancel out completely as two waves destructively interfere in
the same place. A fixed end of a rope is a node. An anti-node is a point on a wave where
maximum displacement takes place. In a standing wave, an anti-node is a place where the two
waves constructively interfere. A free end of a rope is an anti-node.
Definition: Node
A node is a point on a wave where no displacement takes place. In a standing wave, a node
is a place where the two waves cancel out completely as two waves destructively interfere
in the same place. A fixed end of a rope is a node.
Definition: Anti-Node
An anti-node is a point on a wave where maximum displacement takes place. In a standing
wave, an anti-node is a place where the two waves constructively interfere. A free end of a
rope is an anti-node.
Important: The distance between two anti-nodes is only 1
2λ because it is the distance
from a peak to a trough in one of the waves forming the standing wave. It is the same as
the distance between two adjacent nodes. This will be important when we work out the
allowed wavelengths in tubes later. We can take this further because half-way between any
two anti-nodes is a node. Then the distance from the node to the anti-node is half the
distance between two anti-nodes. This is half of half a wavelength which is one quarter of
a wavelength

file_data: 6.4.5|Wavelengths of Standing Waves with Fixed and Free Ends|122
There are many applications which make use of the properties of waves and the use of fixed and
free ends. Most musical instruments rely on the basic picture that we have presented to create
specific sounds, either through standing pressure waves or standing vibratory waves in strings.
The key is to understand that a standing wave must be created in the medium that is oscillating.
There are restrictions as to what wavelengths can form standing waves in a medium.
For example, if we consider a rope that can move in a pipe such that it can have
• both ends free to move (Case 1)
• one end free and one end fixed (Case 2)
• both ends fixed (Case 3).
Each of these cases is slightly different because the free or fixed end determines whether a node or
anti-node will form when a standing wave is created in the rope. These are the main restrictions
when we determine the wavelengths of potential standing waves. These restrictions are known
as boundary conditions and must be met.
In the diagram below you can see the three different cases. It is possible to create standing
waves with different frequencies and wavelengths as long as the end criteria are met.
The longer the wavelength the less the number of anti-nodes in the standing waves. We cannot
have a standing wave with no anti-nodes because then there would be no oscillations. We use n
to number the anti-nodes. If all of the tubes have a length L and we know the end constraints
we can find the wavelength, λ, for a specific number of anti-nodes.
One Node
Let’s work out the longest wavelength we can have in each tube, i.e. the case for n = 1
Case 1: In the first tube, both ends must be nodes, so we can place one anti-node in the middle
of the tube. We know the distance from one node to another is 1
2λ and we also know this
distance is L. So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength:
Case 2: In the second tube, one end must be a node and the other must be an anti-node. We
are looking at the case with one anti-node we are forced to have it at the end. We know the
distance from one node to another is 1
2λ but we only have half this distance contained in the
tube. So :
Case 3: Here both ends are closed and so we must have two nodes so it is impossible to construct
a case with only one node.
Two Nodes
Next we determine which wavelengths could be formed if we had two nodes. Remember that we
are dividing the tube up into smaller and smaller segments by having more nodes so we expect
the wavelengths to get shorter.
n = 2
λ = L λ = 4
3L λ = 2L
Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have two nodes inside
the tube only if we have one anti-node contained inside the tube and one on each end. This
means we have 3 anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half
a wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between the left side and the middle and
another half wavelength between the middle and the right side so there must be one wavelength
inside the tube. The safest thing to do is work out how many half wavelengths there are and
equate this to the length of the tube L and then solve for λ.
Case 2: We want to have two nodes inside the tube. The left end must be a node and the right
end must be an anti-node. We can have one node inside the tube as drawn above. Again we can
count the number of distances between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes. If we start from the left
end we have one half wavelength between the end and the node inside the tube. The distance
from the node inside the tube to the right end which is an anti-node is half of the distance to
another node. So it is half of half a wavelength. Together these add up to the length of the
tube:

Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. This means that the length of the tube is one
half wavelength: So we can equate the two and solve for the wavelength:
1
2
λ = L
λ = 2L
Important: If you ever calculate a longer wavelength for more nodes you have made a
mistake. Remember to check if your answers make sense!
Three Nodes
To see the complete pattern for all cases we need to check what the next step for case 3 is when
we have an additional node. Below is the diagram for the case where n = 3.
n = 3
λ = 2
3L λ = 4
5L λ = L
Case 1: Both ends are open and so they must be anti-nodes. We can have three nodes inside
the tube only if we have two anti-nodes contained inside the tube and one on each end. This
means we have 4 anti-nodes in the tube. The distance between any two anti-nodes is half a
wavelength. This means there is half wavelength between every adjacent pair of anti-nodes.
We count how many gaps there are between adjacent anti-nodes to determine how many half
wavelengths there are and equate this to the length of the tube L and then solve for λ.
we can count the number of distances between adjacent nodes or anti-nodes, together these add
up to the length of the tube. Remember that the distance between the node and an adjacent
anti-node is only half the distance between adjacent nodes. So starting from the left end we
count 3 nodes, so 2 half wavelength intervals and then only a node to anti-node distance:

Case 3: In this case both ends have to be nodes. With one node in between there are two
sets of adjacent nodes. This means that the length of the tube consists of two half wavelength
sections:

file_data: 6.4.6|Superposition and Interference|125
If two waves meet interesting things can happen. Waves are basically collective motion of
particles. So when two waves meet they both try to impose their collective motion on the
particles. This can have quite different results.
If two identical (same wavelength, amplitude and frequency) waves are both trying to form a
peak then they are able to achieve the sum of their efforts. The resulting motion will be a peak
which has a height which is the sum of the heights of the two waves. If two waves are both
trying to form a trough in the same place then a deeper trough is formed, the depth of which is
the sum of the depths of the two waves. Now in this case, the two waves have been trying to
do the same thing, and so add together constructively. This is called constructive interference.
If one wave is trying to form a peak and the other is trying to form a trough, then they are
competing to do different things. In this case, they can cancel out. The amplitude of the
resulting wave will depend on the amplitudes of the two waves that are interfering. If the depth
of the trough is the same as the height of the peak nothing will happen. If the height of the
peak is bigger than the depth of the trough, a smaller peak will appear. And if the trough is
deeper then a less deep trough will appear. This is destructive interference.

file_data: 7|Geometrical Optics - Grade 10|129


file_data: 7.1|Introduction|129
You are indoors on a sunny day. A beam of sunlight through a window lights up a section of
the floor. How would you draw this sunbeam? You might draw a series of parallel lines showing
the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate – no matter
how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam! However, this is a
good way to draw light. It is also a good way to model light geometrically, as we will see in this
chapter.
We will call these narrow, imaginary lines of light light rays. Since light is an electromagnetic
wave, you could think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave. Or, you could
think of a light ray as the path taken by a miniscule particle that carries light. We will always
draw them the same way: as straight lines between objects, images, and optical devices.
We can use light rays to model mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms. The study
of how light interacts with materials is optics. When dealing with light rays, we are usually
interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it. From these angles,
we can work out, for example, the distance between an object and its reflection. We therefore
refer to this kind of optics as geometrical optics.

file_data: 7.2|Light Rays|129
In physics we use the idea of a light ray to indicate the direction that light travels. Light rays
are lines with arrows and are used to show the path that light travels. In Figure 7.1, the light
rays from the object enters the eye and the eye sees the object.
The most important thing to remember is that we can only see an object when light from the
object enters our eyes. The object must be a source of light (for example a light bulb) or else it
must reflect light from a source (for example the moon), and the reflected light enters our eyes.
Important: We cannot see an object unless light from that object enters our eyes.
Definition: Light ray
Light rays are straight lines with arrows to show the path of light.
Important: Light rays are not real. They are merely used to show the path that light
travels.


file_data: 7.2.1|Shadows|132
Objects cast shadows when light shines on them. This is more evidence that light travels in
straight lines. The picture below shows how shadows are formed.

file_data: 7.2.2|Ray Diagrams|132
A ray diagram is a drawing that shows the path of light rays. Light rays are drawn using straight
lines and arrow heads. The figure below shows some examples of ray diagrams.

file_data: 7.3|Reflection|132
When you smile into a mirror, you see your own face smiling back at you. This is caused by the
reflection of light rays on the mirror. Reflection occurs when a light ray bounces off a surface.

file_data: 7.3.1|Terminology|133
In Chapters 5 and 6 we saw that when a pulse or wave strikes a surface it is reflected. This means
that waves bounce off things. Sound waves bounce off walls, light waves bounce off mirrors,
radar waves bounce off aeroplanes and it can explain how bats can fly at night and avoid things
as thin as telephone wires. The phenomenon of reflection is a very important and useful one.
We will use the following terminology. The incoming light ray is called the incident ray. The
light ray moving away from the surface is the reflected ray. The most important characteristic
of these rays is their angles in relation to the reflecting surface. These angles are measured
with respect to the normal of the surface. The normal is an imaginary line perpendicular to
the surface. The angle of incidence, θi is measured between the incident ray and the surface
normal. The angle of reflection, θr is measured between the reflected ray and the surface
normal. This is shown in Figure 7.4.
When a ray of light is reflected, the reflected ray lies in the same plane as the incident ray and
the normal. This plane is called the plane of incidence and is shown in Figure 7.5.

file_data: 7.3.2|Law of Reflection|133
The Law of Reflection states that the angles of incidence and reflection are always equal and
that the reflected ray always lies in the plane of incidence.
Definition: Law of Reflection
The Law of Reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
θi = θr
The simplest example of the law of incidence is if the angle of incidence is 0◦. In this case, the
angle of reflection is also 0◦. You see this when you look straight into a mirror.
Figure 7.6: When a wave strikes a surface at right angles to the surface, then the wave is reflected
directly back.
If the angle of incidence is not 0◦, then the angle of reflection is also not 0◦. For example, if a
light strikes a surface at 60◦ to the surface normal, then the angle that the reflected ray makes
with the surface normal is also 60◦ as shown in Figure 7.7.
Figure 7.7: Ray diagram showing angle of incidence and angle of reflection. The Law of Reflection
states that when a light ray reflects off a surface, the angle of reflection θr is the same as the
angle of incidence θi.

file_data: 7.3.3|Types of Reflection|135
The Law of Reflection is true for any surface. Does this mean that when parallel rays approach
a surface, the reflected rays will also be parallel? This depends on the texture of the reflecting
surface.
Specular Reflection
Figure 7.8(a) shows a surface that is flat and even. Parallel incident light rays hit the smooth
surface and parallel reflected light rays leave the surface. This type of reflection is called specular
reflection. Specular reflection occurs when rays are reflected from a smooth, shiny surface. The
normal to the surface is the same at every point on the surface. Parallel incident rays become
parallel reflected rays. When you look in a mirror, the image you see is formed by specular
reflection.
Diffuse Reflection
Figure 7.8(b) shows a surface with bumps and curves. When multiple rays hit this uneven
surface, diffuse reflection occurs. The incident rays are parallel but the reflected rays are not.
Each point on the surface has a different normal. This means the angle of incidence is different
at each point. Then according to the Law of Reflection, each angle of reflection is different.
Diffuse reflection occurs when light rays are reflected from bumpy surfaces. You can still see a
reflection as long as the surface is not too bumpy. Diffuse reflection enables us to see all objects
that are not sources of light.

file_data: 7.4|Refraction|137
In the previous sections we studied light reflecting off various surfaces. What happens when light
passes through a medium? Like all waves, the speed of light is dependent on the medium in
which it is travelling. When light moves from one medium into another (for example, from air
to glass), the speed of light changes. The effect is that the light ray passing into a new medium
is refracted, or bent. Refraction is therefore the bending of light as it moves from one optical
medium to another.
Definition: Refraction
Refraction is the bending of light that occurs because light travels at different speeds in
different materials.
When light travels from one medium to another, it will be bent away from its original path.
When it travels from an optically dense medium like water or glass to a less dense medium like
air, it will be refracted away from the normal (Figure 7.9). Whereas, if it travels from a less
dense medium to a denser one, it will be refracted towards the normal (Figure 7.10).
Just as we defined an angle of reflection in the previous section, we can similarly define an angle
of refraction as the angle between the surface normal and the refracted ray. This is shown in
Figure 7.11.
Figure 7.9: Light is moving from an optically dense medium to an optically less dense medium.
Light is refracted away from the normal.
Figure 7.10: Light is moving from an optically less dense medium to an optically denser medium.
Light is refracted towards the normal.
Figure 7.11: Light moving from one medium to another bends towards or away from the surface
normal. The angle of refraction θ is shown.

file_data: 7.4.1|Refractive Index|139
Which is easier to travel through, air or water? People usually travel faster through air. So
does light! The speed of light and therefore the degree of bending of the light depends on the
refractive index of material through which the light passes. The refractive index (symbol n) is
the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in the material. You can think of the
refractive index as a measure of how difficult it is for light to get through a material.
Definition: Refractive Index
The refractive index of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed
in the medium.
The symbol c is used to represent the speed of light in a vacuum.
c = 299 792 485m· s−1
For purposes of calculation, we use 3 × 108m · s−1. A vacuum is a region with
no matter in it, not even air. However, the speed of light in air is very close to
that in a vacuum.
Definition: Refractive Index
The refractive index (symbol n) of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum
to its speed in the material and gives an indication of how difficult it is for light to get
through the material.
n =
c
v
where
n = refractive index (no unit)
c = speed of light in a vacuum (3,00 × 108m · s−1)
v = speed of light in a given medium (m · s−1)
Extension: Refractive Index and Speed of Light
Using
n =
c
v
we can also examine how the speed of light changes in different media, because the
speed of light in a vacuum (c) is constant.
If the refractive index n increases, the speed of light in the material v must
decrease. Light therefore travels slowly through materials of high n.
Table 7.4.1 shows refractive indices for various materials. Light travels slower in any material
than it does in a vacuum, so all values for n are greater than 1.

file_data: 7.4.2|Snell's Law|139
Now that we know that the degree of bending, or the angle of refraction, is dependent on the
refractive index of a medium, how do we calculate the angle of refraction?
The angles of incidence and refraction when light travels from one medium to another can be
calculated using Snell’s Law.
Table 7.1: Refractive indices of some materials. nair is calculated at STP and all values are
determined for yellow sodium light which has a wavelength of 589,3 nm.
Definition: Snell’s Law
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
where
n1 = Refractive index of material 1
n2 = Refractive index of material 2
θ1 = Angle of incidence
θ2 = Angle of refraction
Remember that angles of incidence and refraction are measured from the normal, which is an
imaginary line perpendicular to the surface.
Suppose we have two media with refractive indices n1 and n2. A light ray is incident on the
surface between these materials with an angle of incidence θ1. The refracted ray that passes
through the second medium will have an angle of refraction θ2.
If
n2 > n1
then from Snell’s Law,
sin θ1 > sin θ2.
For angles smaller than 90◦, sin θ increases as θ increases. Therefore,
θ1 > θ2.
This means that the angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction and the light ray
is bent toward the normal.
Similarly, if
n2 < n1
then from Snell’s Law,
sin θ1 < sin θ2.
For angles smaller than 90◦, sin θ increases as θ increases. Therefore,
θ1 < θ2.
This means that the angle of incidence is less than the angle of refraction and the light ray is
away toward the normal.
Both these situations can be seen in Figure 7.12.
Figure 7.12: Refraction of two light rays. (a) A ray travels from a medium of low refractive
index to one of high refractive index. The ray is bent towards the normal. (b) A ray travels from
a medium with a high refractive index to one with a low refractive index. The ray is bent away
from the normal.
What happens to a ray that lies along the normal line? In this case, the angle of incidence is 0◦
and
sin θ2 =
n1
n2
sin θ1
= 0
∴ θ2 = 0.
This shows that if the light ray is incident at 0◦, then the angle of refraction is also 0◦. The ray
passes through the surface unchanged, i.e. no refraction occurs.




file_data: 7.4.3|Apparent Depth|143
Imagine a coin on the bottom of a shallow pool of water. If you reach for the coin, you will miss
it because the light rays from the coin are refracted at the water’s surface.
Consider a light ray that travels from an underwater object to your eye. The ray is refracted at
the water surface and then reaches your eye. Your eye does not know Snell’s Law; it assumes
light rays travel in straight lines. Your eye therefore sees the image of the at coin shallower
location. This shallower location is known as the apparent depth.
The refractive index of a medium can also be expressed as


file_data: 7.5|Mirrors|146
A mirror is a highly reflective surface. The most common mirrors are flat and are known as
plane mirrors. Household mirrors are plane mirrors. They are made of a flat piece of glass with
a thin layer of silver nitrate or aluminium on the back. However, other mirrors are curved and
are either convex mirrors or are concave mirrors. The reflecting properties of all three types
of mirrors will be discussed in this section.

file_data: 7.5.1|Image Formation|146
Definition: Image
An image is a representation of an object formed by a mirror or lens. Light from the image
is seen.
If you place a candle in front of a mirror, you now see two candles. The actual, physical candle
is called the object and the picture you see in the mirror is called the image. The object is the
source of the incident rays. The image is the picture that is formed by the reflected rays.
The object could be an actual source that emits light, such as a light bulb or a candle. More
commonly, the object reflects light from another source. When you look at your face in the
mirror, your face does not emit light. Instead, light from a light bulb or from the sun reflects off
your face and then hits the mirror. However, in working with light rays, it is easiest to pretend
the light is coming from the object.
An image formed by reflection may be real or virtual. A real image occurs when light rays
actually intersect at the image. A real image is inverted, or upside down. A virtual image occurs
when light rays do not actually meet at the image. Instead, you ”see” the image because your
eye projects light rays backward. You are fooled into seeing an image! A virtual image is erect,
or right side up (upright).
You can tell the two types apart by putting a screen at the location of the image. A real image
can be formed on the screen because the light rays actually meet there. A virtual image cannot
be seen on a screen, since it is not really there.
To describe objects and images, we need to know their locations and their sizes. The distance
from the mirror to the object is the object distance, do.
The distance from the mirror to the image is the image distance, di.

file_data: 7.5.2|Plane Mirrors|147
When you look into a mirror, you see an image of yourself.
The image created in the mirror has the following properties:
1. The image is virtual.
2. The image is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.
3. The image is laterally inverted. This means that the image is inverted from side to side.
4. The image is the same size as the object.
5. The image is upright.
Virtual images are images formed in places where light does not really reach. Light does not
really pass through the mirror to create the image; it only appears to an observer as though the
light were coming from behind the mirror. Whenever a mirror creates an image which is virtual,
the image will always be located behind the mirror where light does not really pass.
Definition: Virtual Image
A virtual image is upright, on the opposite side of the mirror as the object, and light does
not actually reach it.

file_data: 7.5.3|Ray Diagrams|148
We draw ray diagrams to predict the image that is formed by a plane mirror. A ray diagram is
a geometrical picture that is used for analyzing the images formed by mirrors and lenses. We
draw a few characteristic rays from the object to the mirror. We then follow ray-tracing rules to
find the path of the rays and locate the image.
Important: A mirror obeys the Law of Reflection.
The ray diagram for the image formed by a plane mirror is the simplest possible ray diagram.
Figure 7.15 shows an object placed in front of a plane mirror. It is convenient to have a central
line that runs perpendicular to the mirror. This imaginary line is called the principal axis.
Important: Ray diagrams
The following should be remembered when drawing ray diagrams:
1. Objects are represented by arrows. The length of the arrow represents the height of
the object.
2. If the arrow points upwards, then the object is described as upright or erect. If the
arrow points downwards then the object is described as inverted.
3. If the object is real, then the arrow is drawn with a solid line. If the object is virtual,
then the arrow is drawn with a dashed line.
Method: Ray Diagrams for Plane Mirrors
Ray diagrams are used to find the position and size and whether the image is real or virtual.
1. Draw the plane mirror as a straight line on a principal axis.
2. Draw the object as an arrow in front of the mirror.
3. Draw the image of the object, by using the principle that the image is placed at the same
distance behind the mirror that the object is in front of the mirror. The image size is also
the same as the object size.
4. Place a dot at the point the eye is located.
5. Pick one point on the image and draw the reflected ray that travels to the eye as it sees
this point. Remember to add an arrowhead.
6. Draw the incident ray for light traveling from the corresponding point on the object to the
mirror, such that the law of reflection is obeyed.
7. Continue for other extreme points on the object.
Suppose a light ray leaves the top of the object traveling parallel to the principal axis. The ray
will hit the mirror at an angle of incidence of 0 degrees. We say that the ray hits the mirror
normally. According to the law of reflection, the ray will be reflected at 0 degrees. The ray then
bounces back in the same direction. We also project the ray back behind the mirror because this
is what your eye does.
Another light ray leaves the top of the object and hits the mirror at its centre. This ray will be
reflected at the same angle as its angle of incidence, as shown. If we project the ray backward
behind the mirror, it will eventually cross the projection of the first ray we drew. We have found
the location of the image! It is a virtual image since it appears in an area that light cannot
actually reach (behind the mirror). You can see from the diagram that the image is erect and is
the same size as the object. This is exactly as we expected.
We use a dashed line to indicate that the image is virtual.


file_data: 7.5.4|Spherical Mirrors|150
The second class of mirrors that we will look at are spherical mirrors. These mirrors are called
spherical mirrors because if you take a sphere and cut it as shown in Figure 7.16 and then polish
the inside of one and the outside of the other, you will get a concave mirror and convex mirror
as shown. These two mirrors will be studied in detail.
The centre of curvature is the point at the centre of the sphere and describes how big the sphere
is.


file_data: 7.5.5|Concave Mirrors|150
The first type of curved mirror we will study are concave mirrors. Concave mirrors have the shape
shown in Figure 7.17. As with a plane mirror, the principal axis is a line that is perpendicular to
the centre of the mirror.
If you think of light reflecting off a concave mirror, you will immediately see that things will look
very different compared to a plane mirror. The easiest way to understand what will happen is
to draw a ray diagram and work out where the images will form. Once we have done that it is
easy to see what properties the image has.
First we need to define a very important characteristic of the mirror. We have seen that the
centre of curvature is the centre of the sphere from which the mirror is cut. We then define that a distance that is half-way between the centre of curvature and the mirror on the principal axis.
This point is known as the focal point and the distance from the focal point to the mirror is
known as the focal length (symbol f). Since the focal point is the midpoint of the line segment
joining the vertex and the center of curvature, the focal length would be one-half the radius of
curvature. This fact can come in very handy, remember if you know one then you know the
other!
Definition: Focal Point
The focal point of a mirror is the midpoint of a line segment joining the vertex and the
centre of curvature. It is the position at which all parallel rays are focussed.
Why are we making such a big deal about this point we call the focal point? It has an important
property we will use often. A ray parallel to the principal axis hitting the mirror will always be
reflected through the focal point. The focal point is the position at which all parallel rays are
focussed.
Figure 7.19: A concave mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image. Each incident ray
is reflected according to the Law of Reflection. The intersection of the reflected rays gives the
location of the image. Here the image is real and inverted.
From Figure 7.19, we see that the image created by a concave mirror is real and inverted, as
compared to the virtual and erect image created by a plane mirror.
Definition: Real Image
A real image can be cast on a screen; it is inverted, and on the same side of the mirror as
the object.

file_data: 7.5.6|Convex Mirrors|153
The second type of curved mirror we will study are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors have the shape
shown in Figure 7.20. As with a plane mirror, the principal axis is a line that is perpendicular to
the centre of the mirror.
We have defined the focal point as that point that is half-way along the principal axis between
the centre of curvature and the mirror. Now for a convex mirror, this point is behind the mirror.
A convex mirror has a negative focal length because the focal point is behind the mirror.
Figure 7.20: Convex mirror with principle axis, focal point (F) and centre of curvature (C). The
centre of the mirror is the optical centre (O).
To determine what the image from a convex mirror looks like and where the image is located,
we need to remember that a mirror obeys the laws of reflection and that light appears to come
from the image. The image created by a convex mirror is shown in Figure 7.21.
Figure 7.21: A convex mirror with three rays drawn to locate the image. Each incident ray is
reflected according to the Law of Reflection. The reflected rays diverge. If the reflected rays are
extended behind the mirror, then their intersection gives the location of the image behind the
mirror. For a convex mirror, the image is virtual and upright.
From Figure 7.21, we see that the image created by a convex mirror is virtual and upright, as
compared to the real and inverted image created by a concave mirror.
Extension: Divergence
A convex mirror is also known as a diverging mirror. Light rays appear to diverge
from the focal point of a convex mirror.

file_data: 7.5.8|Magnification|154
In Figures 7.19 and 7.21, the height of the object and image arrows were different. In any optical
system where images are formed from objects, the ratio of the image height, hi, to the object
height, ho is known as the magnification, m.
m =
hi
ho
This is true for the mirror examples we showed above and will also be true for lenses, which will
be introduced in the next sections. For a plane mirror, the height of the image is the same as the
height of the object, so the magnification is simply m = hi
ho
= 1. If the magnification is greater
than 1, the image is larger than the object and is said to be magnified. If the magnification is
less than 1, the image is smaller than the object so the image is said to be diminished.


file_data: 7.6|Total Internal Reflection and Fibre Optics|156


file_data: 7.6.1|Total Internal Reflection|156
When we increase the angle of incidence, we reach a point where the angle of refraction is 90◦
and the refracted ray runs along the surface of the medium. This angle of incidence is called the
critical angle.
Definition: Critical Angle
The critical angle is the angle of incidence where the angle of reflection is 90◦. The light
must shine from a dense to a less dense medium.
If the angle of incidence is bigger than this critical angle, the refracted ray will not emerge from
the medium, but will be reflected back into the medium. This is called total internal reflection.
Total internal reflection takes place when
• light shines from an optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium.
• the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.
Definition: Total Internal Reflection
Total internal reflection takes place when light is reflected back into the medium because
the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.
Each medium has its own unique critical angle. For example, the critical angle for glass is 42◦,
and that of water is 48,8◦. We can calculate the critical angle for any medium.
Calculating the Critical Angle
Now we shall learn how to derive the value of the critical angle for two given media. The process
is fairly simple and involves just the use of Snell’s Law that we have already studied. To recap,
Snell’s Law states:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
where n1 is the refractive index of material 1, n2 is the refractive index of material 2, θ1 is the
angle of incidence and θ2 is the angle of refraction. For total internal reflection we know that
the angle of incidence is the critical angle. So,
θ1 = θc.
However, we also know that the angle of refraction at the critical angle is 90◦. So we have:
θ2 = 90◦.
We can then write Snell’s Law as:
n1 sin θc = n2 sin 90◦
Solving for θc gives:
n1 sin θc = n2 sin 90◦
sin θc =
n2
n1
(1)
∴ θc = sin−1 (
n2
n1
)
Important: Take care that for total internal reflection the incident ray is always in the
denser medium.



file_data: 7.6.2|Fibre Optics|161
Total internal reflection is a powerful tool since it can be used to confine light. One of the
most common applications of total internal reflection is in fibre optics. An optical fibre is a thin,
transparent fibre, usually made of glass or plastic, for transmitting light. Optical fibres are usually
thinner than a human hair! The construction of a single optical fibre is shown in Figure 7.23.
The basic functional structure of an optical fibre consists of an outer protective cladding and an
inner core through which light pulses travel. The overall diameter of the fibre is about 125 μm
(125×10−6m) and that of the core is just about 10 μm (10×10−6m). The mode of operation
of the optical fibres, as mentioned above, depends on the phenomenon of total internal reflection.
The difference in refractive index of the cladding and the core allows total internal reflection in
the same way as happens at an air-water surface. If light is incident on a cable end with an
angle of incidence greater than the critical angle then the light will remain trapped inside the
glass strand. In this way, light travels very quickly down the length of the cable.
Fibre Optics in Telecommunications
Optical fibres are most common in telecommunications, because information can be transported
over long distances, with minimal loss of data. The minimised loss of data gives optical fibres
an advantage over conventional cables.
Data is transmitted from one end of the fibre to another in the form of laser pulses. A single strand
is capable of handling over 3000 simultaneous transmissions which is a huge improvement over
the conventional co-axial cables. Multiple signal transmission is achieved by sending individual
light pulses at slightly different angles. For example if one of the pulses makes a 72,23◦ angle
of incidence then a separate pulse can be sent at an angle of 72,26◦! The transmitted data is
received almost instantaneously at the other end of the cable since the information coded onto
the laser travels at the speed of light! During transmission over long distances repeater stations
are used to amplify the signal which has weakened somewhat by the time it reaches the station.
The amplified signals are then relayed towards their destination and may encounter several other
repeater stations on the way.
Fibre Optics in Medicine
Optic fibres are used in medicine in endoscopes.
The main part of an endoscope is the optical fibre. Light is shone down the optical fibre and a
medical doctor can use the endoscope to look inside a patient. Endoscopes are used to examine
the inside of a patient’s stomach, by inserting the endoscope down the patient’s throat.
Endoscopes allow minimally invasive surgery. This means that a person can be diagnosed and
treated through a small incision. This has advantages over open surgery because endoscopy is
quicker and cheaper and the patient recovers more quickly. The alternative is open surgery which
is expensive, requires more time and is more traumatic for the patient.
Endoscopy means to look inside and refers to looking inside the human body for
diagnosing medical conditions.

file_data: 8|Magnetism - Grade 10|167

file_data: 8.1|Introduction|167
Magnetism is the force that a magnetic object exerts, through its magnetic field, on another
object. The two objects do not have to physically touch each other for the force to be exerted.
Object 2 feels the magnetic force from Object 1 because of Object 1’s surrounding magnetic
field.
Humans have known about magnetism for many thousands of years. For example, lodestone is
a magnetised form of the iron oxide mineral magnetite. It has the property of attracting iron
objects. It is referred to in old European and Asian historical records; from around 800 BCE in
Europe and around 2 600 BCE in Asia.
The root of the English word magnet is from the Greek word magnes, probably
from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone.

file_data: 8.2|Magnetic fields|167
A magnetic field is a region in space where a magnet or object made of ferromagnetic material
will experience a non-contact force.
Electrons moving inside any object have magnetic fields associated with them. In most materials
these fields point in all directions, so the net magnetic field is zero. For example, in the plastic ball
below, the directions of the magnetic fields of the electrons (shown by the arrows) are pointing
in different directions and cancel each other out. Therefore the plastic ball is not magnetic and
has no magnetic field.
In some materials (e.g. iron), called ferromagnetic materials, there are regions called domains,
where these magnetic fields line up. All the atoms in each domain group together so that the
magnetic fields from their electrons point the same way. The picture shows a piece of an iron
needle zoomed in to show the domains with the electric fields lined up inside them.
In permanent magnets, many domains are lined up, resulting in a net magnetic field. Objects
made from ferromagnetic materials can be magnetised, for example by rubbing a magnet along
the object in one direction. This causes the magnetic fields of most, or all, of the domains to line
up and cause the object to have a magnetic field and be magnetic. Once a ferromagnetic object
has been magnetised, it can stay magnetic without another magnet being nearby (i.e. without
being in another magnetic field). In the picture below, the needle has been magnetised because
the magnetic fields in all the domains are pointing in the same direction.

file_data: 8.3|Permanent magnets|169


file_data: 8.3.1|The poles of permanent magnets|169
Because the domains in a permanent magnet all line up in a particular direction, the magnet
has a pair of opposite poles, called north (usually shortened to N) and south (usually shortened
to S). Even if the magnet is cut into tiny pieces, each piece will still have both a N and a S
pole. These poles always occur in pairs. In nature we never find a north magnetic pole or south
magnetic pole on its own.
Magnetic fields are different to gravitational and electric fields. In nature, positive and negative
electric charges can be found on their own, but you never find just a north magnetic pole or
south magnetic pole on its own. On the very small scale, zooming in to the size of atoms,
magnetic fields are caused by moving charges (i.e. the negatively charged electrons).

file_data: 8.3.2|Magnetic attraction and repulsion|169
Like poles of magnets repel one another whilst unlike poles attract. This means that two N poles
or two S poles will push away from each other while a N pole and a S pole will be drawn towards
each other.
Definition: Attraction and Repulsion
Like poles of magnets repel each other whilst unlike poles attract each other.

file_data: 8.3.3|Representing magnetic fields|170
Magnetic fields can be represented using magnetic field lines. Although the magnetic field of
a permanent magnet is everywhere surrounding the magnet (in all 3 dimensions), we draw only
some of the field lines to represent the field (usually only 2 dimensions are shown in drawings).
In areas where the magnetic field is strong, the field lines are closer together. Where the field is
weaker, the field lines are drawn further apart. The strength of a magnetic field is referred to as
the magnetic flux
Important:
1. Field lines never cross.
2. Arrows drawn on the field lines indicate the direction of the field.
3. A magnetic field points from the north to the south pole of a magnet.
As the activity shows, one can map the magnetic field of a magnet by placing it underneath a
piece of paper and sprinkling iron filings on top. The iron filings line themselves up parallel to
the magnetic field.
Another tool one can use to find the direction of a magnetic field is a compass. The compass
arrow points in the direction of the field.
As already said, opposite poles of a magnet attract each other and bringing them together causes
their magnetic field lines to converge (come together). Like poles of a magnet repel each other
and bringing them together causes their magnetic field lines to diverge (bend out from each
other).
Extension: Ferromagnetism and Retentivity
Ferromagnetism is a phenomenon shown by materials like iron, nickel or cobalt.
These materials can form permanent magnets. They always magnetise so as to
be attracted to a magnet, no matter which magnetic pole is brought toward the
unmagnetised iron/nickel/cobalt.
The ability of a ferromagnetic material to retain its magnetisation after an external
field is removed is called its retentivity.
Paramagnetic materials are materials like aluminium or platinum, which become
magnetised in an external magnetic field in a similar way to ferromagnetic materials.
However, they lose their magnetism when the external magnetic field is removed.
Diamagnetism is shown by materials like copper or bismuth, which become mag-
netised in a magnetic field with a polarity opposite to the external magnetic field.
Unlike iron, they are slightly repelled by a magnet.

file_data: 8.4|The compass and the earth's magnetic field|173
A compass is an instrument which is used to find the direction of a magnetic field. It can do
this because a compass consists of a small metal needle which is magnetised itself and which is
free to turn in any direction. Therefore, when in the presence of a magnetic field, the needle is
able to line up in the same direction as the field.
Lodestone, a magnetised form of iron-oxide, was found to orientate itself in a
north-south direction if left free to rotate by suspension on a string or on a float
in water. Lodestone was therefore used as an early navigational compass.
Compasses are mainly used in navigation to find direction on the earth. This works because the
earth itself has a magnetic field which is similar to that of a bar magnet (see the picture below).
The compass needle aligns with the magnetic field direction and points north (or south). Once
you know where north is, you can figure out any other direction. A picture of a compass is shown
below:
Some animals can detect magnetic fields, which helps them orientate themselves and find di-
rection. Animals which can do this include pigeons, bees, Monarch butterflies, sea turtles and
fish.


file_data: 8.4.1|The earth's magnetic field|175
In the picture below, you can see a representation of the earth’s magnetic field which is very
similar to the magnetic field of a giant bar magnet like the one on the right of the picture. So
the earth has two sets of north poles and south poles: geographic poles and magnetic poles.
The earth’s magnetic field is thought to be caused by churning liquid metals in the core which
causes electric currents and a magnetic field. From the picture you can see that the direction
of magnetic north and true north are not identical. The geographic north pole, which is the
point through which the earth’s rotation axis goes, is about 11,5o away from the direction of
the magnetic north pole (which is where a compass will point). However, the magnetic poles
shift slightly all the time.
Another interesting thing to note is that if we think of the earth as a big bar magnet, and we
know that magnetic field lines always point from north to south, then the compass tells us that
what we call the magnetic north pole is actually the south pole of the bar magnet!
The direction of the earth’s magnetic field flips direction about once every
200 000 years! You can picture this as a bar magnet whose north and south pole
periodically switch sides. The reason for this is still not fully understood.
The earth’s magnetic field is very important for humans and other animals on earth because it
stops charged particles emitted by the sun from hitting the earth and us. Charged particles can
also damage and cause interference with telecommunications (such as cell phones). Charged
particles (mainly protons and electrons) are emitted by the sun in what is called the solar wind,
and travel towards the earth. These particles spiral in the earth’s magnetic field towards the
poles. If they collide with other particles in the earth’s atmosphere they sometimes cause red or
green lights or a glow in the sky which is called the aurora. This happens close to the north and
south pole and so we cannot see the aurora from South Africa.

file_data: 9|Electrostatics - Grade 10|177


file_data: 9.1|Introduction|177
Electrostatics is the study of electric charge which is static (not moving).


file_data: 9.2|Two kinds of charge|177
All objects surrounding us (including people!) contain large amounts of electric charge. There
are two types of electric charge: positive charge and negative charge. If the same amounts
of negative and positive charge are brought together, they neutralise each other and there is
no net charge. Neutral objects are objects which contain positive and negative charges, but in
equal numbers. However, if there is a little bit more of one type of charge than the other on the
object then the object is said to be electrically charged. The picture below shows what the
distribution of charges might look like for a neutral, positively charged and negatively charged
object.
There are:
6 positive charges and
6 negative charges
6 + (-6) = 0
There is zero net charge:
The object is neutral
8 positive charges and
6 negative charges
8 + (-6) = 2
The net charge is +2
The object is positively charged
6 positive charges and
9 negative charges
6 + (-9) = -3
The net charge is -3
The object is negatively charged


file_data: 9.3|Unit of charge|177
Charge is measured in units called coulombs (C). A coulomb of charge is a very large charge.
In electrostatics we therefore often work with charge in microcoulombs (1 μC = 1 × 10−6 C)
and nanocoulombs (1 nC = 1 × 10−9 C).

file_data: 9.4|Conservation of charge|177
Objects can become charged by contact or by rubbing them. This means that they can gain
extra negative or positive charge. Charging happens when you, for example, rub your feet against
the carpet. When you then touch something metallic or another person, you will feel a shock as the excess charge that you have collected is discharged.
Important: Charge, just like energy, cannot be created or destroyed. We say that charge
is conserved.
When you rub your feet against the carpet, negative charge is transferred to you from the carpet.
The carpet will then become positively charged by the same amount.
Another example is to take two neutral objects such as a plastic ruler and a cotton cloth
(handkerchief). To begin, the two objects are neutral (i.e. have the same amounts of positive
and negative charge.)

The neutral cotton cloth has

The total number of charges is:
(9+5)=14 positive charges
(9+5)=14 negative charges
9 negative charges
BEFORE rubbing:
Now, if the cotton cloth is used to rub the ruler, negative charge is transferred from the cloth to
the ruler. The ruler is now negatively charged and the cloth is positively charged. If you count
up all the positive and negative charges at the beginning and the end, there are still the same
amount. i.e. total charge has been conserved!

(12+2)=14 negative charges
12 negative charges
AFTER rubbing:
It is now positively charged.


file_data: 9.5|Force between Charges|178
The force exerted by non-moving (static) charges on each other is called the electrostatic force.
The electrostatic force between:
• like charges is repulsive
• opposite (unlike) charges is attractive.
In other words, like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. This is
different to the gravitational force which is only attractive.

The closer together the charges are, the stronger the electrostatic force between them.

(longer distance between charges)
Extension: Electrostatic Force
The electrostatic force determines the arrangement of charge on the surface of con-
ductors. When we place a charge on a spherical conductor the repulsive forces
between the individual like charges cause them to spread uniformly over the sur-
face of the sphere. However, for conductors with non-regular shapes, there is a
concentration of charge near the point or points of the object.

This collection of charge can actually allow charge to leak off the conductor if the
point is sharp enough. It is for this reason that buildings often have a lightning rod
on the roof to remove any charge the building has collected. This minimises the
possibility of the building being struck by lightning. This “spreading out” of charge
would not occur if we were to place the charge on an insulator since charge cannot
move in insulators.

The word ‘electron’ comes from the Greek word for amber. The ancient Greeks
observed that if you rubbed a piece of amber, you could use it to pick up bits of
straw.


file_data: 9.6|Conductors and insulators|181
All atoms are electrically neutral i.e. they have the same amounts of negative and positive charge
inside them. By convention, the electrons carry negative charge and the protons carry positive
charge. The basic unit of charge, called the elementary charge, e, is the amount of charge carried
by one electron.
All the matter and materials on earth are made up of atoms. Some materials allow electrons to
move relatively freely through them (e.g. most metals, the human body). These materials are
called conductors.
Other materials do not allow the charge carriers, the electrons, to move through them (e.g.
plastic, glass). The electrons are bound to the atoms in the material. These materials are called
non-conductors or insulators.
If an excess of charge is placed on an insulator, it will stay where it is put and there will be a
concentration of charge in that area of the object. However, if an excess of charge is placed on
a conductor, the like charges will repel each other and spread out over the surface of the object.
When two conductors are made to touch, the total charge on them is shared between the two.
If the two conductors are identical, then each conductor will be left with half of the total charge.
Extension: Charge and electrons
The basic unit of charge, namely the elementary charge is carried by the electron
(equal to 1.602×10−19 C!). In a conducting material (e.g. copper), when the atoms
bond to form the material, some of the outermost, loosely bound electrons become
detached from the individual atoms and so become free to move around. The charge
carried by these electrons can move around in the material. In insulators, there are
very few, if any, free electrons and so the charge cannot move around in the material.



file_data: 9.6.1|The electroscope|182
The electroscope is a very sensitive instrument which can be used to detect electric charge. A
diagram of a gold leaf electroscope is shown the figure below. The electroscope consists of a
glass container with a metal rod inside which has 2 thin pieces of gold foil attached. The other
end of the metal rod has a metal plate attached to it outside the glass container.
The electroscope detects charge in the following way: A charged object, like the positively
charged rod in the picture, is brought close to (but not touching) the neutral metal plate of
the electroscope. This causes negative charge in the gold foil, metal rod, and metal plate, to
be attracted to the positive rod. Because the metal (gold is a metal too!) is a conductor, the
charge can move freely from the foil up the metal rod and onto the metal plate. There is now
more negative charge on the plate and more positive charge on the gold foil leaves. This is
called inducing a charge on the metal plate. It is important to remember that the electroscope
is still neutral (the total positive and negative charges are the same), the charges have just been
induced to move to different parts of the instrument! The induced positive charge on the gold
leaves forces them apart since like charges repel! This is how we can tell that the rod is charged.
If the rod is now moved away from the metal plate, the charge in the electroscope will spread
itself out evenly again and the leaves will fall down again because there will no longer be an
induced charge on them.
Grounding
If you were to bring the charged rod close to the uncharged electroscope, and then you touched
the metal plate with your finger at the same time, this would cause charge to flow up from the
ground (the earth), through your body onto the metal plate. This is called grounding. The
charge flowing onto the plate is opposite to the charge on the rod, since it is attracted to the
rod. Therefore, for our picture, the charge flowing onto the plate would be negative. Now
charge has been added to the electroscope. It is no longer neutral, but has an excess of negative
charge. Now if we move the rod away, the leaves will remain apart because they have an excess
of negative charge and they repel each other.


file_data: 9.7|Attraction between charged and uncharged objects|183


file_data: 9.7.1|Polarisation of Insulators|183
Unlike conductors, the electrons in insulators (non-conductors) are bound to the atoms of the
insulator and cannot move around freely in the material. However, a charged object can still
exert a force on a neutral insulator through the concept of polarisation.
If a positively charged rod is brought close to a neutral insulator such as polystyrene, it can
attract the bound electrons to move round to the side of the atoms which is closest to the rod
and cause the positive nuclei to move slightly to the opposite side of the atoms. This process is
called polarisation. Although it is a very small (microscopic) effect, if there are many atoms and
the polarised object is light (e.g. a small polystyrene ball), it can add up to enough force to be
attracted onto the charged rod. Remember, that the polystyrene is only polarised, not charged.
The polystyrene ball is still neutral since no charge was added or removed from it. The picture
shows a not-to-scale view of the polarised atoms in the polystyrene ball:
Some materials are made up of molecules which are already polarised. These are molecules which
have a more positive and a more negative side but are still neutral overall. Just as a polarised
polystyrene ball can be attracted to a charged rod, these materials are also affected if brought
close to a charged object.
Water is an example of a substance which is made of polarised molecules. If a positively charged
rod is brought close to a stream of water, the molecules can rotate so that the negative sides all
line up towards the rod. The stream of water will then be attracted to the rod since opposite
charges attract.

file_data: 10|Electric Circuits - Grade 10|187


file_data: 10.1|Electric Circuits|187
In South Africa, people depend on electricity to provide power for most appliances in the home,
at work and out in the world in general. For example, flourescent lights, electric heating and
cooking (on electric stoves), all depend on electricity to work. To realise just how big an impact
electricity has on our daily lives, just think about what happens when there is a power failure or
load shedding.
Important: Safety Warning: We believe in experimenting and learning about physics at
every opportunity, BUT playing with electricity can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Do
not try to build home made circuits alone. Make sure you have someone with you who knows
if what you are doing is safe. Normal electrical outlets are dangerous. Treat electricity with
respect in your everyday life.

file_data: 10.1.1|Closed circuits|187
In the experiment above, you will have seen that the light bulb only glows when there is a closed
circuit i.e. there are no gaps in the circuit and all the circuit elements are connected in a closed
loop. Therefore, in order for charges to flow, a closed circuit and an energy source (in this case
the battery) are needed. (Note: you do not have to have a lightbulb in the circuit! We used this
as a check that charge was flowing.)
Definition: Electric circuit
An electric circuit is a closed path (with no breaks or gaps) along which electrical charges
(electrons) flow powered by an energy source.

file_data: 10.1.2|Representing electric circuits|188
Components of electrical circuits
Some common elements (components) which can be found in electrical circuits include light
bulbs, batteries, connecting leads, switches, resistors, voltmeters and ammeters. You will learn
more about these items in later sections, but it is important to know what their symbols are and
how to represent them in circuit diagrams. Below is a table with the items and their symbols:
Circuit diagrams
Definition: Representing circuits
A physical circuit is the electric circuit you create with real components.
A circuit diagram is a drawing which uses symbols to represent the different components
in the physical circuit.
We use circuit diagrams to represent circuits because they are much simpler and more general
than drawing the physical circuit because they only show the workings of the electrical compo-
nents. You can see this in the two pictures below. The first picture shows the physical circuit
for an electric torch. You can see the light bulb, the batteries, the switch and the outside plastic
casing of the torch. The picture is actually a cross-section of the torch so that we can see inside
it.
Figure 10.1: Physical components of an electric torch. The dotted line shows the path of the
electrical circuit.
Below is the circuit diagram for the electric torch. Now the light bulb is represented by its
symbol, as are the batteries, the switch and the connecting wires. It is not necessary to show
the plastic casing of the torch since it has nothing to do with the electric workings of the torch.
You can see that the circuit diagram is much simpler than the physical circuit drawing!
Series and parallel circuits
There are two ways to connect electrical components in a circuit: in series or in parallel.
Definition: Series circuit
In a series circuit, the charge has a single path from the battery, returning to the battery.
Definition: Parallel circuit
In a parallel circuit, the charge has multiple paths from the battery, returning to the battery.
The picture below shows a circuit with three resistors connected in series on the left and a circuit
with three resistors connected in parallel on the right:

file_data: 10.2|Potential Difference|192


file_data: 10.2.1|Potential Difference|192
When a circuit is connected and is a complete circuit charge can move through the circuit.
Charge will not move unless there is a reason, a force. Think of it as though charge is at rest
and something has to push it along. This means that work needs to be done to make charge
move. A force acts on the charges, doing work, to make them move. The force is provided by
the battery in the circuit.
We call the moving charge ”current” and we will talk about this later.
The position of the charge in the circuit tells you how much potential energy it has because of
the force being exerted on it. This is like the force from gravity, the higher an object is above
the ground (position) the more potential energy it has.
The amount of work to move a charge from one point to another point is how much the potential
energy has changed. This is the difference in potential energy, called potential difference. Notice
that it is a difference between the value of potential energy at two points so we say that potential
difference is measured between or across two points. We do not say potential difference through
something.
Definition: Potential Difference
Electrical potential difference as the difference in electrical potential energy per unit charge
between two points. The units of potential difference are the volt (V).
The units are volt (V), which is the same as joule per coulomb, the amount of work done per
unit charge. Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.

When resistors are connected in parallel the start and end points for all the resistors are the same.
These points have the same potential energy and so the potential difference between them is the
same no matter what is put in between them. You can have one, two or many resistors between
the two points, the potential difference will not change. You can ignore whatever components
are between two points in a circuit when calculating the difference between the two points.
Look at the following circuit diagrams. The battery is the same in all cases, all that changes is
more resistors are added between the points marked by the black dots. If we were to measure
the potential difference between the two dots in these circuits we would get the same answer for
all three cases.
Lets look at two resistors in parallel more closely. When you construct a circuit you use wires and
you might think that measuring the voltage in different places on the wires will make a difference.
This is not true. The potential difference or voltage measurement will only be different if you
measure a different set of components. All points on the wires that have no circuit components
between them will give you the same measurements.
All three of the measurements shown in the picture below will give you the same voltages. The
different measurement points on the left have no components between them so there is no change
in potential energy. Exactly the same applies to the different points on the right. When you
measure the potential difference between the points on the left and right you will get the same
answer.



file_data: 10.2.3|Potential Difference and Series Resistors|194
When resistors are in series, one after the other, there is a potential difference across each
resistor. The total potential difference across a set of resistors in series is the sum of the
potential differences across each of the resistors in the set. This is the same as falling a large
distance under gravity or falling that same distance (difference) in many smaller steps. The total
distance (difference) is the same.
Look at the circuits below. If we measured the potential difference between the black dots in
all of these circuits it would be the same just like we saw above. So we now know the total
potential difference is the same across one, two or three resistors. We also know that some work
is required to make charge flow through each one, each is a step down in potential energy. These
steps add up to the total drop which we know is the difference between the two dots.
b
Let us look at this in a bit more detail. In the picture below you can see what the different
measurements for 3 identical resistors in series could look like. The total voltage across all three
resistors is the sum of the voltages across the individual resistors.

file_data: 10.2.4|Ohm's Law|194
The voltage is the change in potential energy or work done when charge moves between two
points in the circuit. The greater the resistance to charge moving the more work that needs to
be done. The work done or voltage thus depends on the resistance. The potential difference is
proportional to the resistance.
Definition: Ohm’s Law
Voltage across a circuit component is proportional to the resistance of the component.
Use the fact that voltage is proportional to resistance to calculate what proportion of the total
voltage of a circuit will be found across each circuit element.
We know that the total voltage is equal to V1 in the first circuit, to V1 + V2 in the second
circuit and V1 + V2 + V3 in the third circuit.
We know that the potential energy lost across a resistor is proportional to the resistance of the
component. The total potential difference is shared evenly across the total resistance of the
circuit. This means that the potential difference per unit of resistance is
Then the voltage across a resistor is just the resistance times the potential difference per unit of
resistance

file_data: 10.2.5|EMF|195
When you measure the potential difference across (or between) the terminals of a battery you
are measuring the ”electromotive force” (emf) of the battery. This is how much potential energy
the battery has to make charges move through the circuit. This driving potential energy is equal
to the total potential energy drops in the circuit. This means that the voltage across the battery
is equal to the sum of the voltages in the circuit.
We can use this information to solve problems in which the voltages across elements in a circuit
add up to the emf.
EMF = Vtotal


file_data: 10.3|Current|198


file_data: 10.3.1|Flow of Charge|198
We have been talking about moving charge. We need to be able to deal with numbers, how
much charge is moving, how fast is it moving? The concept that gives us this information is
called current. Current allows us to quantify the movement of charge.
When we talk about current we talk about how much charge moves past a fixed point in circuit
in one second. Think of charges being pushed around the circuit by the battery, there are charges
in the wires but unless there is a battery they won’t move. When one charge moves the charges
next to it also move. They keep their spacing. If you had a tube of marbles like in this picture.
marble marble
If you push one marble into the tube one must come out the other side. If you look at any point
in the tube and push one marble into the tube, one marble will move past the point you are
looking at. This is similar to charges in the wires of a circuit.
If a charge moves they all move and the same number move at every point in the circuit.



file_data: 10.3.2|Current|198
Now that we’ve thought about the moving charges and visualised what is happening we need
to get back to quantifying moving charge. I’ve already told you that we use current but we still
need to define it.
Definition: Current
Current is the rate at which charges moves past a fixed point in a circuit. We use the
symbol I to show current and it is measured in amperes (A). One ampere is one coulomb
of charge moving in one second.
I =
Q
t
When current flows in a circuit we show this on a diagram by adding arrows. The arrows show
the direction of flow in a circuit. By convention we say that charge flows from the positive
terminal on a battery to the negative terminal.


file_data: 10.3.3|Series Circuits|199
In a series circuit, the charge has a single path from the battery, returning to the battery.
The arrows in this picture show you the direction that charge will flow in the circuit. They don’t
show you much charge will flow, only the direction.
Benjamin Franklin made a guess about the direction of charge flow when rubbing
smooth wax with rough wool. He thought that the charges flowed from the wax to
the wool (i.e. from positive to negative) which was opposite to the real direction.
Due to this, electrons are said to have a negative charge and so objects which Ben
Franklin called “negative” (meaning a shortage of charge) really have an excess
of electrons. By the time the true direction of electron flow was discovered, the
convention of “positive” and “negative” had already been so well accepted in the
scientific world that no effort was made to change it.
Important: A cell does not produce the same amount of current no matter what is
connected to it. While the voltage produced by a cell is constant, the amount of current
supplied depends on what is in the circuit.
How does the current through the battery in a circuit with several resistors in series compare to
the current in a circuit with a single resistor?


file_data: 10.3.4|Parallel Circuits|200
How does the current through the battery in a circuit with several resistors in parallel compare
to the current in a circuit with a single resistor?
Why is this the case? Why do more resistors make it easier for charge to flow in the circuit?
It is because they are in parallel so there are more paths for charge to take to move. You can
think of it like a highway with more lanes, or the tube of marbles splitting into multiple parallel
tubes. The more branches there are, the easier it is for charge to flow. You will learn more about
the total resistance of parallel resistors later but always remember that more resistors in parallel
mean more pathways. In series the pathways come one after the other so it does not make it
easier for charge to flow.



file_data: 10.4|Resistance|202


file_data: 10.4.1|What causes resistance?|202
We have spoken about resistors that slow down the flow of charge in a conductor. On a
microscopic level, electrons moving through the conductor collide with the particles of which
the conductor (metal) is made. When they collide, they transfer kinetic energy. The electrons
therefore lose kinetic energy and slow down. This leads to resistance. The transferred energy
causes the conductor to heat up. You can feel this directly if you touch a cellphone charger when
you are charging a cell phone - the charger gets warm!
Definition: Resistance
Resistance slows down the flow of charge in a circuit. We use the symbol R to show
resistance and it is measured in units called Ohms with the symbol 
.
1 Ohm = 1
Volt
Ampere
.
All conductors have some resistance. For example, a piece of wire has less resistance than a light
bulb, but both have resistance. The high resistance of the filament (small wire) in a lightbulb
causes the electrons to transfer a lot of their kinetic energy in the form of heat. The heat energy
is enough to cause the filament to glow white-hot which produces light. The wires connecting
the lamp to the cell or battery hardly even get warm while conducting the same amount of
current. This is because of their much lower resistance due to their larger cross-section (they
are thicker).
An important effect of a resistor is that it converts electrical energy into other forms of energy,
such as heat and light.
There is a special type of conductor, called a superconductor that has no
resistance, but the materials that make up superconductors only start supercon-
ducting at very low temperatures (approximately -170◦C).
Why do batteries go flat?
A battery stores chemical potential energy. When it is connected in a circuit, a chemical reaction
takes place inside the battery which converts chemical potential energy to electrical energy
which powers the electrons to move through the circuit. All the circuit elements (such as the
conducting leads, resistors and lightbulbs) have some resistance to the flow of charge and convert
the electrical energy to heat and/or light. The battery goes flat when all its chemical potential
energy has been converted into other forms of energy.


file_data: 10.4.2|Resistors in electric circuits|202
It is important to understand what effect adding resistors to a circuit has on the total resistance
of a circuit and on the current that can flow in the circuit.
Resistors in series
When we add resistors in series to a circuit, we increase the resistance to the flow of current.
There is only one path that the current can flow down and the current is the same at all places
in the series circuit. Take a look at the diagram below: On the left there is a circuit with a single
resistor and a battery. No matter where we measure the current, it is the same in a series circuit.
On the right, we have added a second resistor in series to the circuit. The total resistance of
the circuit has increased and you can see from the reading on the ammeter that the current in
the circuit has decreased.
Resistors in parallel
In contrast to the series case, when we add resistors in parallel, we create more paths along
which current can flow. By doing this we decrease the total resistance of the circuit!
Take a look at the diagram below. On the left we have the same circuit as in the previous
diagram with a battery and a resistor. The ammeter shows a current of 1 ampere. On the right
we have added a second resistor in parallel to the first resistor. This has increased the number
of paths (branches) the charge can take through the circuit - the total resistance has decreased.
You can see that the current in the circuit has increased. Also notice that the current in the
different branches can be different.



file_data: 10.5|Instruments to Measure voltage, current and resistance|204
As we have seen in previous sections, an electric circuit is made up of a number of different
components such as batteries, resistors and light bulbs. There are devices to measure the
properties of these components. These devices are called meters.
For example, one may be interested in measuring the amount of current flowing through a circuit
using an ammeter or measuring the voltage provided by a battery using a voltmeter. In this
section we will discuss the practical usage of voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters.

file_data: 10.5.1|Voltmeter|204
A voltmeter is an instrument for measuring the voltage between two points in an electric circuit.
In analogy with a water circuit, a voltmeter is like a meter designed to measure pressure difference.
Since one is interested in measuring the voltage between two points in a circuit, a voltmeter
must be connected in parallel with the portion of the circuit on which the measurement is made.
V
Figure 10.3: A voltmeter should be connected in parallel in a circuit.
Figure 10.3 shows a voltmeter connected in parallel with a battery. One lead of the voltmeter is
connected to one end of the battery and the other lead is connected to the opposite end. The
voltmeter may also be used to measure the voltage across a resistor or any other component of
a circuit that has a voltage drop.

file_data: 10.5.2|Ammeter|204
An ammeter is an instrument used to measure the flow of electric current in a circuit. Since one
is interested in measuring the current flowing through a circuit component, the ammeter must
be connected in series with the measured circuit component (Figure 10.4).

file_data: 10.5.3|Ohmmeter|204
An ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical resistance. The basic ohmmeter can
function much like an ammeter. The ohmmeter works by suppling a constant voltage to the
resistor and measuring the current flowing through it. The measured current is then converted
into a corresponding resistance reading through Ohm’s Law. Ohmmeters only function correctly
when measuring resistance that is not being powered by a voltage or current source. In other
words, you cannot measure the resistance of a component that is already connected to a circuit.
This is because the ohmmeter’s accurate indication depends only on its own source of voltage.
The presence of any other voltage across the measured circuit component interferes with the
ohmmeter’s operation. Figure 10.5 shows an ohmmeter connected with a resistor.

file_data: 10.5.4|Meters Impact on Circuit|205
A good quality meter used correctly will not significantly change the values it is used to measure.
This means that an ammeter has very low resistance to not slow down the flow of charge.
A voltmeter has a very high resistance so that it does not add another parallel pathway to the
circuit for the charge to flow along.

file_data: 10.6|Exercises - Electric circuits|205



file_data: 11|Vectors|211


file_data: 11.1|Introduction|211
This chapter focuses on vectors. We will learn what is a vector, how it differs from everyday
numbers, how to add, subtract and multiply them and where they appear in Physics.
Are vectors Physics? No, vectors themselves are not Physics. Physics is just a description of
the world around us. To describe something we need to use a language. The most common
language used to describe Physics is Mathematics. Vectors form a very important part of the
mathematical description of Physics, so much so that it is absolutely essential to master the use
of vectors.


file_data: 11.2|Scalars and Vectors|211
In Mathematics, you learned that a number is something that represents a quantity. For example
if you have 5 books, 6 apples and 1 bicycle, the 5, 6, and 1 represent how many of each item
you have.
These kinds of numbers are known as scalars.
Definition: Scalar
A scalar is a quantity that has only magnitude (size).
An extension to a scalar is a vector, which is a scalar with a direction. For example, if you travel
1 km down Main Road to school, the quantity 1 km down Main Road is a vector. The 1 km
is the quantity (or scalar) and the down Main Road gives a direction.
In Physics we use the word magnitude to refer to the scalar part of the vector.
Definition: Vectors
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
A vector should tell you how much and which way.
For example, a man is driving his car east along a freeway at 100 km·hr−1. What we have given
here is a vector – the velocity. The car is moving at 100 km·hr−1(this is the magnitude) and we
know where it is going – east (this is the direction). Thus, we know the speed and direction of
the car. These two quantities, a magnitude and a direction, form a vector we call velocity.

file_data: 11.3|Notation|211
Vectors are different to scalars and therefore has its own notation.

file_data: 11.3.1|Mathematical Representation|212
There are many ways of writing the symbol for a vector. Vectors are denoted by symbols with an
arrow pointing to the right above it. For example, ~a, ~v and ~F represent the vectors acceleration,
velocity and force, meaning they have both a magnitude and a direction.
Sometimes just the magnitude of a vector is needed. In this case, the arrow is omitted. In other
words, F denotes the magnitude of vector ~F. | ~F| is another way of representing the magnitude
of a vector.

file_data: 11.3.2|Graphical Representation|212
Vectors are drawn as arrows. An arrow has both a magnitude (how long it is) and a direction
(the direction in which it points). The starting point of a vector is known as the tail and the
end point is known as the head.

file_data: 11.4|Directions|212
There are many acceptable methods of writing vectors. As long as the vector has a magnitude
and a direction, it is most likely acceptable. These different methods come from the different
methods of expressing a direction for a vector.

file_data: 11.4.1|Relative Directions|212
The simplest method of expressing direction is relative directions: to the left, to the right,
forward, backward, up and down.

file_data: 11.4.2|Compass Directions|213
Another common method of expressing direc-
tions is to use the points of a compass: North,
South, East, and West.
If a vector does not point exactly in one
of the compass directions, then we use an angle.
For example, we can have a vector pointing 40◦
North of West. Start with the vector pointing
along the West direction:
Then rotate the vector towards the north
until there is a 40◦ angle between the vector
and the West.
The direction of this vector can also be described
as: W 40◦ N (West 40◦ North); or N 50◦ W
(North 50◦ West)

file_data: 11.4.3|Bearing|213
The final method of expressing direction is to use a bearing. A bearing is a direction relative to
a fixed point.
Given just an angle, the convention is to define the angle with respect to the North. So, a vector
with a direction of 110◦ has been rotated clockwise 110◦ relative to the North. A bearing is
always written as a three digit number, for example 275◦ or 080◦ (for 80◦).

file_data: 11.5|Drawing Vectors|214
In order to draw a vector accurately we must specify a scale and include a reference direction in
the diagram. A scale allows us to translate the length of the arrow into the vector’s magnitude.
For instance if one chose a scale of 1 cm = 2 N (1 cm represents 2 N), a force of 20 N towards
the East would be represented as an arrow 10 cm long. A reference direction may be a line
representing a horizontal surface or the points of a compass.
Method: Drawing Vectors
1. Decide upon a scale and write it down.
2. Determine the length of the arrow representing the vector, by using the scale.
3. Draw the vector as an arrow. Make sure that you fill in the arrow head.
4. Fill in the magnitude of the vector.

file_data: 11.6|Mathematical Properties of Vectors|215
Vectors are mathematical objects and we need to understand the mathematical properties of
vectors, like adding and subtracting.
For all the examples in this section, we will use displacement as our vector quantity. Displacement
was discussed in Chapter 3. Displacement is defined as the distance together with direction of
the straight line joining a final point to an initial point.
Remember that displacement is just one example of a vector. We could just as well have decided
to use forces or velocities to illustrate the properties of vectors.


file_data: 11.6.1|Adding Vectors|215
When vectors are added, we need to add both a magnitude and a direction. For example, take 2
steps in the forward direction, stop and then take another 3 steps in the forward direction. The
first 2 steps is a displacement vector and the second 3 steps is also a displacement vector. If we
did not stop after the first 2 steps, we would have taken 5 steps in the forward direction in total.
Therefore, if we add the displacement vectors for 2 steps and 3 steps, we should get a total of
5 steps in the forward direction. Graphically, this can be seen by first following the first vector
two steps forward and then following the second one three steps forward:
We add the second vector at the end of the first vector, since this is where we now are after
the first vector has acted. The vector from the tail of the first vector (the starting point) to the
head of the last (the end point) is then the sum of the vectors. This is the head-to-tail method
of vector addition.
As you can convince yourself, the order in which you add vectors does not matter. In the example
above, if you decided to first go 3 steps forward and then another 2 steps forward, the end result
would still be 5 steps forward.
The final answer when adding vectors is called the resultant. The resultant displacement in this
case will be 5 steps forward.
Definition: Resultant of Vectors
The resultant of a number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the
individual vectors acting together.
In other words, the individual vectors can be replaced by the resultant – the overall effect is the
same. If vectors ~a and ~b have a resultant ~R, this can be represented mathematically as,
Let us consider some more examples of vector addition using displacements. The arrows tell you
how far to move and in what direction. Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward, while
arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the examples below and check
them.
This example says 1 step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice
as long – two steps forward.
This examples says 1 step backward and then another step backward is the same as an arrow
twice as long – two steps backward.
It is sometimes possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of
what you have done is that you have gone nowhere (your start and end points are at the same
place). In this case, your resultant displacement is a vector with length zero units. We use the
symbol ~0 to denote such a vector:
It is important to realise that the directions are not special– ‘forward and backwards’ or ‘left and
right’ are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel directions:
In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one another. However the
same head-to-tail technique of vector addition can be applied to vectors in any direction.
Now you have discovered one use for vectors; describing resultant displacement – how far and
in what direction you have travelled after a series of movements.
Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with displacements, all vectors behave in
exactly the same way. Thus, if given a number of forces acting on a body you can use the same
method to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to vector addition
in more detail later.

file_data: 11.6.2|Subtracting Vectors|217
What does it mean to subtract a vector? Well this is really simple; if we have 5 apples and we
subtract 3 apples, we have only 2 apples left. Now lets work in steps; if we take 5 steps forward
and then subtract 3 steps forward we are left with only two steps forward:
What have we done? You originally took 5 steps forward but then you took 3 steps back. That
backward displacement would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with
length 3. The net result of adding these two vectors is 2 steps forward:
Thus, subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite direction
(i.e. subtracting 3 steps forwards is the same as adding 3 steps backwards).
Important: Subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite
direction.
This suggests that in this problem to the right was chosen as the positive direction. Arrows to
the right are positive and arrows to the left are negative. More generally, vectors in opposite
directions differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as positive, then vectors acting down are negative).
Thus, changing the sign of a vector simply reverses its direction:


file_data: 11.6.3|Scalar Multiplication|218
What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar (an ordinary number)?
Going back to normal multiplication we know that 2 ×2 is just 2 groups of 2 added together to
give 4. We can adopt a similar approach to understand how vector multiplication works.

file_data: 11.7|Techniques of Vector Addition|218
Now that you have learned about the mathematical properties of vectors, we return to vector
addition in more detail. There are a number of techniques of vector addition. These techniques
fall into two main categories - graphical and algebraic techniques.

file_data: 11.7.1|Graphical Techniques|218
Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote individual vectors and
their resultants. We next discuss the two primary graphical techniques, the head-to-tail technique
and the parallelogram method.
The Head-to-Tail Method
In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used displacements and the head-to-tail
graphical method of vector addition as an illustration. The head-to-tail method of graphically
adding vectors is a standard method that must be understood.
Method: Head-to-Tail Method of Vector Addition
1. Choose a scale and include a reference direction.
2. Choose any of the vectors and draw it as an arrow in the correct direction and of the
correct length – remember to put an arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.
3. Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the arrowhead of the first vector
in the correct direction and of the correct length.
4. Continue until you have drawn each vector – each time starting from the head of the
previous vector. In this way, the vectors to be added are drawn one after the other head-
to-tail.
5. The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the
last. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its
direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.
The Parallelogram Method
The parallelogram method is another graphical technique of finding the resultant of two vectors.
Method: The Parallelogram Method
1. Choose a scale and a reference direction.
2. Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct length in
the correct direction.
3. Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction from the
tail of the first vector.
4. Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.
5. The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. The magnitude can be determined
from the length of its arrow using the scale. The direction too can be determined from
the scale diagram.
The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two vectors. However, it is arguably
the most intuitive way of adding two forces acting at a point.

file_data: 11.7.2|Algebraic Addition and Subtraction of Vectors|223
Vectors in a Straight Line
Whenever you are faced with adding vectors acting in a straight line (i.e. some directed left and
some right, or some acting up and others down) you can use a very simple algebraic technique:
Method: Addition/Subtraction of Vectors in a Straight Line
1. Choose a positive direction. As an example, for situations involving displacements in the
directions west and east, you might choose west as your positive direction. In that case,
displacements east are negative.
2. Next simply add (or subtract) the vectors using the appropriate signs.
3. As a final step the direction of the resultant should be included in words (positive answers
are in the positive direction, while negative resultants are in the negative direction).
In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to calculate the resultant
displacement. This was possible since the directions of motion were perpendicular (north and
east). Algebraic techniques, however, are not limited to cases where the vectors to be combined
are along the same straight line or at right angles to one another. The following example
illustrates this.


file_data: 11.8|Components of Vectors|228
In the discussion of vector addition we saw that a number of vectors acting together can be
combined to give a single vector (the resultant). In much the same way a single vector can be
broken down into a number of vectors which when added give that original vector. These vectors
which sum to the original are called components of the original vector. The process of breaking
a vector into its components is called resolving into components.
While summing a given set of vectors gives just one answer (the resultant), a single vector can be
resolved into infinitely many sets of components. In the diagrams below the same black vector
is resolved into different pairs of components. These components are shown as dashed lines.
When added together the dashed vectors give the original black vector (i.e. the original vector
is the resultant of its components).
In practice it is most useful to resolve a vector into components which are at right angles to one
another, usually horizontal and vertical.
Any vector can be resolved into a horizontal and a vertical component. If ~A is a vector, then
the horizontal component of ~A is ~Ax and the vertical component is ~Ay.

file_data: 11.8.1|Vector addition using components|231
Components can also be used to find the resultant of vectors. This technique can be applied
to both graphical and algebraic methods of finding the resultant. The method is simple: make
a rough sketch of the problem, find the horizontal and vertical components of each vector, find
the sum of all horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components and then use
them to find the resultant.
Consider the two vectors, ~A and ~B, in Figure 11.3, together with their resultant, ~ R.
Each vector in Figure 11.3 can be broken down into a component in the x-direction and one
in the y-direction. These components are two vectors which when added give you the original
vector as the resultant. This is shown in Figure 11.4 where we can see that:
In summary, addition of the x components of the two original vectors gives the x component of
the resultant. The same applies to the y components. So if we just added all the components
together we would get the same answer! This is another important property of vectors.

file_data: 12|Force, Momentum and Impulse - Grade 11|239


file_data: 12.1|Introduction|239
In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion. In this chapter we will learn
that a net force is needed to cause motion. We recall what a force is and learn about how force
and motion are related. We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse, and
we learn more about turning forces and the force of gravity.


file_data: 12.2|Force|239


file_data: 12.2.1|What is a force?|239
A force is anything that can cause a change to objects. Forces can:
• change the shape of an object
• move or stop an object
• change the direction of a moving object.
A force can be classified as either a contact force or a non-contact force.
A contact force must touch or be in contact with an object to cause a change. Examples of
contact forces are:
• the force that is used to push or pull things, like on a door to open or close it
• the force that a sculptor uses to turn clay into a pot
• the force of the wind to turn a windmill
A non-contact force does not have to touch an object to cause a change. Examples of non-
contact forces are:
• the force due to gravity, like the Earth pulling the Moon towards itself
• the force due to electricity, like a proton and an electron attracting each other
• the force due to magnetism, like a magnet pulling a paper clip towards itself
The unit of force is the newton (symbol N). This unit is named after Sir Isaac Newton who
first defined force. Force is a vector quantity and has a magnitude and a direction. We use the
abbreviation F for force.
There is a popular story that while Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple
tree, an apple fell on his head, and he suddenly thought of the Universal Law of
Gravitation. Coincidently, the weight of a small apple is approximately 1 N.
Force was first described by Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC - 212 BC).
Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, physicist and
engineer. He was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of the city, despite
orders from the Roman general, Marcellus, that he was not to be harmed.
This chapter will often refer to the resultant force acting on an object. The resultant force is
simply the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object. It is very important to remember
that all the forces must be acting on the same object. The resultant force is the force that has
the same effect as all the other forces added together.


file_data: 12.2.2|Examples of Forces in Physics|240
Most of Physics revolves around forces. Although there are many different forces, all are handled
in the same way. All forces in Physics can be put into one of four groups. These are gravitational
forces, electromagnetic forces, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. You will mostly come
across gravitational or electromagnetic forces at school.
Gravitational Forces
Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you
throw a ball in the air, its mass and the Earth’s mass attract each other, which leads to a force
between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth, and the Earth accelerates towards the ball.
The movement of the Earth towards the ball is, however, so small that you couldn’t possibly
measure it.
Electromagnetic Forces
Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are electromagnetic in origin. They
have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces
were different things. After much work and experimentation, it has been realised that they are
actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory.
Electric or Electrostatic Forces
If we have objects carrying electrical charge, which are not moving, then we are dealing with
electrostatic forces (Coulomb’s Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may
seem strange, since gravity is obviously very powerful, and holding a balloon to the wall seems to
be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done, but if we think about it: for gravity
to be detectable, we need to have a very large mass nearby. But a balloon rubbed in someone’s
hair can stick to a wall with a force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravity—with just
the charges in the balloon and the wall!
Magnetic Forces
The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the
interaction between moving charges as opposed to the fixed charges involved in Coulomb’s Law.
Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses,car engines and computer
data storage. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them
around sites.
Friction
According to Newton’s First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving
without a force acting on it will keep on moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table stop?
The answer is friction. Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom
of a box with the molecules on a table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence
friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. Later in this chapter we will discuss
frictional forces a little more.
Drag Forces
This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium like an aeroplane flying
through air. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and
because of this the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you
move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports
car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from
high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way
to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show, the greater the
drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.


file_data: 12.2.3|Systems and External Forces|241
The concepts of a system and an external forces are very important in Physics. A system is any
collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such a system then an external force
is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example a car pulling
two trailers.
If we draw a box around the two trailers they can be considered a closed system or unit. When
we look at the forces on this closed system the following forces will apply:
• The force of the car pulling the unit (trailer A and B)
• The force of friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the
direction of motion)
• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system (gravity)
• The force of the road pushing upwards on the system
These forces are called external forces to the system.
The following forces will not apply:
The force of A pulling B
• The force of B pulling A
• The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction
of motion)
We can also draw a box around trailer A or B, in which case the forces will be different.
If we consider trailer A as a system, the following external forces will apply:
• The force of the car pulling on A (towards the right)
• The force of B pulling on A (towards the left)
• The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity)
• The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer


file_data: 12.2.4|Force Diagrams|242
If we look at the example above and draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the
two-trailer-unit, the diagram would look like this:
It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw force diagrams:
• Make your drawing large and clear.
• You must use arrows and the direction of the arrow will show the direction of the force.
• The length of the arrow will indicate the size of the force, in other words, the longer arrows
in the diagram (F1 for example) indicates a bigger force than a shorter arrow (Ff ). Arrows
of the same length indicate forces of equal size (FN and Fg). Use ?little lines? like in
maths to show this.
• Draw neat lines using a ruler. The arrows must touch the system or object.
• All arrows must have labels. Use letters with a key on the side if you do not have enough
space on your drawing.
• The labels must indicate what is applying the force (the force of the car?) on what the
force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which direction (to the right)
• If the values of the forces are known, these values can be added to the diagram or key.



file_data: 12.2.5|Free Body Diagrams|243
In a free-body diagram, the object of interest is drawn as a dot and all the forces acting on it
are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot. A free body diagram for the two-trailer-system
will therefore look like this:



file_data: 12.2.6|Finding the Resultant Force|244
The easiest way to determine a resultant force is to draw a free body diagram. Remember from
Chapter ?? that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vector’s magnitude and the
direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in.
After we have done this, we have a diagram of vectors and we simply find the sum of the vectors
to get the resultant force.
Figure 12.1: (a) Force diagram of 2 forces acting on a box. (b) Free body diagram of the box.
For example, two people push on a box from opposite sides with forces of 4 N and 6 N respectively
as shown in Figure 12.1(a). The free body diagram in Figure 12.1(b) shows the object represented
by a dot and the two forces are represented by arrows with their tails on the dot.
As you can see, the arrows point in opposite directions and have different lengths. The resultant
force is 2 N to the left. This result can be obtained algebraically too, since the two forces act
along the same line. First, as in motion in one direction, choose a frame of reference. Secondly,
add the two vectors taking their directions into account.
For the example, assume that the positive direction is to the right, then:
FR = (+4N) + (−6N)
= −2N
= 2N to the left
Remember that a negative answer means that the force acts in the opposite direction to the one
that you chose to be positive. You can choose the positive direction to be any way you want,
but once you have chosen it you must keep it.
As you work with more force diagrams in which the forces exactly balance, you may notice that
you get a zero answer (e.g. 0 N). This simply means that the forces are balanced and that the
object will not move.
Once a force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in Chapter ??
can be used. Depending on the situation you might choose to use a graphical technique such as
the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method, or else an algebraic approach to determine
the resultant. Since force is a vector all of these methods apply.

file_data: 12.3|Newton's Laws|246
In grade 10 you learned about motion, but did not look at how things start to move. You have
also learned about forces. In this section we will look at the effect of forces on objects and how
we can make things move.




file_data: 12.3.1|Newton's First Law|247
Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist who lived in England (1642-1727). He was interested in the
reason why objects move. He suggested that objects that are stationary will remain stationary,
unless a force acts on them and objects that are moving will keep on moving, unless a force
slows them down, speeds them up or let them change direction. From this he formulated what
is known as Newton’s First Law of Motion:
Definition: Newton’s First Law of Motion
An object will remain in a state of rest or continue traveling at constant velocity, unless
acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force.
Let us consider the following situations:
An ice skater pushes herself away from the side of the ice rink and skates across the ice. She
will continue to move in a straight line across the ice unless something stops her. Objects are
also like that. If we kick a soccer ball across a soccer field, according to Newton’s First Law,
the soccer ball should keep on moving forever! However, in real life this does not happen. Is
Newton’s Law wrong? Not really. Newton’s First Law applies to situations where there aren’t
any external forces present. This means that friction is not present. In the case of the ice skater,
the friction between the skates and the ice is very little and she will continue moving for quite a
distance. In the case of the soccer ball, air resistance (friction between the air and the ball) and
friction between the grass and the ball is present and this will slow the ball down.
Newton’s First Law in action
We experience Newton’s First Law in every day life. Let us look at the following examples:
Rockets:
A spaceship is launched into space. The force of the exploding gases pushes the rocket through
the air into space. Once it is in space, the engines are switched off and it will keep on moving
at a constant velocity. If the astronauts want to change the direction of the spaceship they need
to fire an engine. This will then apply a force on the rocket and it will change its direction.
Seat belts:
We wear seat belts in cars. This is to protect us when the car is involved in an accident. If
a car is traveling at 120 km·hr−1, the passengers in the car is also traveling at 120 km·hr−1.
When the car suddenly stops a force is exerted on the car (making it slow down), but not on the
passengers. The passengers will carry on moving forward at 120 km·hr−1according to Newton
I. If they are wearing seat belts, the seat belts will stop them and therefore prevent them from
getting hurt.


file_data: 12.3.2|Newton's Second Law of Motion|249
According to Newton I, things ’like to keep on doing what they are doing’. In other words, if
an object is moving, it likes to keep on moving and if an object is stationary, it likes to stay
stationary. So how do objects start to move then?
Let us look at the example of a 10 kg box on a rough table. If we push lightly on the box as
indicated in the diagram, the box won’t move. Let’s say we applied a force of 100 N, yet the
box remains stationary. At this point a frictional force of 100 N is acting on the box, preventing
the box from moving. If we increase the force, lets say to 150 N and the box just about starts to
move, the frictional force is 150 N. To be able to move the box, we need to push hard enough to
overcome the friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply a force of 200 N remembering
that a frictional force of 150 N is present, the ’first’ 150 N will be used to overcome or ’cancel’
the friction and the other 50 N will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate
an object we must have a resultant force acting on the block.
Now, what do you think will happen if we pushed harder, lets say 300 N? Or, what do you
think will happen if the mass of the block was more, say 20 kg, or what if it was less? Let us
investigate how the motion of an object is affected by mass and force.
You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is, the slower it moved.
The acceleration is indirectly proportional to the mass. In mathematical terms: a ∝ 1
m
In a similar investigation where the mass is kept constant, but the applied force is varied, you
will find that the bigger the force is, the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the
trolley is therefore directly proportional to the resultant force. In mathematical terms: a ∝ F.
If we rearrange the above equations, we get a ∝ F
m OR F = ma
Newton formulated his second law as follows:
Definition: Newton’s Second Law of Motion
If a resultant force acts on a body, it will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the
resultant force. The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant
force and indirectly proportional to the mass of the body. The mathematical representation
is a ∝ F
m.
Applying Newton’s Second Law
Newton’s Second Law can be applied to a variety of situations. We will look at the main types
of examples that you need to study.
Object on an inclined plane
When we place an object on a slope the force of gravity (Fg) acts straight down and not
perpendicular to the slope. Due to gravity pulling straight down, the object will tend to slide down the slope with a force equal to the horizontal component of the force of gravity (Fg sin θ).
The object will ’stick’ to the slope due to the frictional force between the object and the surface.
As you increase the angle of the slope, the horizontal component will also increase until the
frictional force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope.
The force of gravity will also tend to push an object ’into’ the slope. This force is equal to the
vertical component of the force of gravity (Fg cos θ). There is no movement in this direction as
this force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ?pushing force? is called
the normal force (N) and is equal to the resultant force in the vertical direction, Fg sin θ in this
case, but opposite in direction.
Important: Do not use the abbreviation W for weight as it is used to abbreviate ’work’.
Rather use the force of gravity Fg for weight.
Lifts and rockets
So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across a surface, in other words hori-
zontal motion. Here we only considered horizontal forces, but we can also lift objects up or let
them fall. This is vertical motion where only vertical forces are being considered.
Let us consider a 500 kg lift, with no passengers, hanging on a cable. The purpose of the
cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go a little so that it
can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the motion
of the lift.
Stage 1:
The 500 kg lift is stationary at the second floor of a tall building.
Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant force acting on the lift. This
means that the upward forces must be balanced by the downward forces. The only force acting
down is the force of gravity which is equal to (500 x 9,8 = 4900 N) in this case. The cable must
therefore pull upwards with a force of 4900 N to keep the lift stationary at this point.
Stage 2:
The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of 1 m·s−2.
If the lift is accelerating, it means that there is a resultant force in the direction of the motion.
This means that the force acting upwards is now bigger than the force of gravity Fg (down). To
find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation:
(Remember to choose a direction as positive. We have chosen upwards as positive.)
FR = ma
Fc + Fg = ma
Fc + (−4900) = (500)(1)
Fc = 5400 N upwards
The answer makes sense as we need a bigger force upwards to cancel the effect of gravity as well
as make the lift go faster.
Stage 3:
The lift moves at a constant velocity.
When the lift moves at a constant velocity, it means that all the forces are balanced and that
there is no resultant force. The acceleration is zero, therefore FR = 0. The force acting upwards
is equal to the force acting downwards, therefore Fc = 4900 N.
Stage 4:
The lift slow down at a rate of 2m·s−2.
As the lift is now slowing down there is a resultant force downwards. This means that the force
acting downwards is bigger than the force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the force
applied by the cable (Fc) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as
positive, which means that the acceleration will be a negative number.
This makes sense as we need a smaller force upwards to ensure a resultant force down. The
force of gravity is now bigger than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down.
Stage 5:
The cable snaps.
When the cable snaps, the force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only
force that is present would be the force of gravity. The lift will freefall and its acceleration can
be calculated as follows:
Rockets
Like with lifts, rockets are also examples of objects in vertical motion. The force of gravity pulls
the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The force that the
engine exerts must overcome the force of gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The
worked example below looks at the application of Newton’s Second Law in launching a rocket.



file_data: 12.3.3|Exercise|261


file_data: 12.3.4|Newton's Third Law of Motion|263
Newton’s Third Law of Motion deals with the interaction between pairs of objects. For example,
if you hold a book up against a wall you are exerting a force on the book (to keep it there) and
the book is exerting a force back at you (to keep you from falling through the book). This may
sound strange, but if the book was not pushing back at you, your hand will push through the
book! These two forces (the force of the hand on the book (F1) and the force of the book on
the hand (F2)) are called an action-reaction pair of forces. They have the same magnitude, but
act in opposite directions and act on different objects (the one force is onto the book and the
other is onto your hand).
There is another action-reaction pair of forces present in this situation. The book is pushing
against the wall (action force) and the wall is pushing back at the book (reaction). The force of
the book on the wall (F3) and the force of the wall on the book (F4) are shown in the diagram.
Definition: Newton’s Third Law of Motion
If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of equal magnitude on body
A, but in the opposite direction.
Newton’s action-reaction pairs can be found everywhere in life where two objects interact with
one another. The following worked examples will illustrate this:



file_data: 12.3.5|Exercise|267


file_data: 12.3.6|Different types of forces|268
Tension
Tension is the magnitude of the force that exists in objects like ropes, chains and struts that are
providing support. For example, there are tension forces in the ropes supporting a child’s swing
hanging from a tree.
Contact and non-contact forces
In this chapter we have come across a number of different types of forces, for example a push
or a pull, tension in a string, frictional forces and the normal. These are all examples of contact
forces where there is a physical point of contact between applying the force and the object.
Non-contact forces are forces that act over a distance, for example magnetic forces, electrostatic forces and gravitational forces.
When an object is placed on a surface, two types of surface forces can be identified. Fric-
tion is a force that acts between the surface and the object and parallel to the surface. The
normal force is a force that acts between the object and the surface and parallel to the surface.
The normal force
A 5 kg box is placed on a rough surface and a 10 N force is applied at an angle of 36,9◦ to
the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal force (N or FN) is the force between
the box and the surface acting in the vertical direction. If this force is not present the box
would fall through the surface because the force of gravity pulls it downwards. The normal force
therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal force by considering all the forces in the
vertical direction. All the forces in the vertical direction must add up to zero because there is
no movement in the vertical direction.
The most interesting and illustrative normal force question, that is often asked, has to do with
a scale in a lift. Using Newton’s third law we can solve these problems quite easily.
When you stand on a scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no
acceleration downwards because there is a reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards
on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the gravitational force were less then
the reading on the scale would be less.
Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly.
We will now move to a lift moving at constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then
acceleration is zero.
In the previous two examples we got exactly the same result because the net acceleration on the
man was zero! If the lift is accelerating downwards things are slightly different and now we will
get a more interesting answer!
Friction forces
When the surface of one object slides over the surface of another, each body exerts a frictional
force on the other. For example if a book slides across a table, the table exerts a frictional
force onto the book and the book exerts a frictional force onto the table (Newton’s Third Law).
Frictional forces act parallel to the surfaces.
A force is not always big enough to make an object move, for example a small applied force
might not be able to move a heavy crate. The frictional force opposing the motion of the crate
is equal to the applied force but acting in the opposite direction. This frictional force is called
static friction. When we increase the applied force (push harder), the frictional force will also
increase until the applied force overcomes it. This frictional force can vary from zero (when
no other forces are present and the object is stationary) to a maximum that depends on the
surfaces. When the applied force is greater than the frictional force and the crate will move.
The frictional force will now decrease to a new constant value which is also dependent on the
surfaces. This is called kinetic friction. In both cases the maximum frictional force is related to
the normal force and can be calculated as follows:
For static friction: Ff ≤ μs N
Where μs = the coefficient of static friction
and N = normal force
For kinetic friction: Ff = μk N
Where μk = the coefficient of kinetic friction
and N = normal force
Remember that static friction is present when the object is not moving and kinetic friction
while the object is moving. For example when you drive at constant velocity in a car on a tar
road you have to keep the accelerator pushed in slightly to overcome the kinetic friction between
the tar road and the wheels of the car. The higher the value for the coefficient of friction, the
more ’sticky’ the surface is and the lower the value, the more ’slippery’ the surface is.
The frictional force (Ff ) acts in the horizontal direction and can be calculated in a similar way
to the normal for as long as there is no movement. If we use the same example as in figure 12.12
and we choose to the right as positive,
We often think about friction in a negative way but very often friction is useful without us
realizing it. If there was no friction and you tried to prop a ladder up against a wall, it would
simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs. The brakes
of cars would be useless if it wasn’t for friction!


file_data: 12.3.7|Exercise|275


file_data: 12.3.8|Forces in equilibrium|276
At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant forces cause objects to accelerate
in a straight line. If an object is stationary or moving at constant velocity then either,
• no forces are acting on the object, or
• the forces acting on that object are exactly balanced.
In other words, for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity, the resultant
force acting on the object is zero. Additionally, if there is a perpendicular moment of force, then
the object will rotate. You will learn more about moments of force later in this chapter.
Therefore, in order for an object not to move or to be in equilibrium, the sum of the forces
(resultant force) must be zero and the sum of the moments of force must be zero.
Definition: Equilibrium
An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the forces acting on it and the sum of the
moments of the forces equal to zero.
If a resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying
an additional force that exactly balances this resultant. Such a force is called the equilibrant
and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the original resultant force acting on the
object.
Definition: Equilibrant
The equilibrant of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium,
and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force.
In the figure the resultant of F1 and F2 is shown. The equilibrant of F1 and F2 is then the
vector opposite in direction to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. F3).
• F1, F2 and F3 are in equilibrium
• F3 is the equilibrant of F1 and F2
• F1 and F2 are kept in equilibrium by F3
As an example of an object in equilibrium, consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the
arrangement below:
Let us draw a free body diagram for the object. In the free body diagram the object is drawn as
a dot and all forces acting on the object are drawn in the correct directions starting from that
dot. In this case, three forces are acting on the object.
Each rope exerts a force on the object in the direction of the rope away from the object. These
tension forces are represented by T1 and T2. Since the object has mass, it is attracted towards
the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the force diagram as Fg.
Since the object is stationary, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. In other words the
three force vectors drawn tail-to-head form a closed triangle:


file_data: 12.3.9|Exercise|279


file_data: 12.4|Forces between Masses|282
In Chapter ??, you saw that gravitational fields exert forces on masses in the field. A field is
a region of space in which an object experiences a force. The strength of a field is defined by
a field strength. For example, the gravitational field strength, g, on or near the surface of the
Earth has a value that is approximately 9,8 m·s−2.
The force exerted by a field of strength g on an object of mass m is given by:
F = m · g (12.1)
This can be re-written in terms of g as:
This means that g can be understood to be a measure of force exerted per unit mass.
The force defined in Equation 12.1 is known as weight.
Objects in a gravitational field exert forces on each other without touching. The gravitational
force is an example of a non-contact force.
Gravity is a force and therefore must be described by a vector - so remember magnitude and
direction.


file_data: 12.4.1|Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation|282
Definition: Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force directed along the line connecting
the two. This force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional
to the square of the distance between them.
The magnitude of the attractive gravitational force between the two point masses, F is given
by:
where: G is the gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of the first point mass, m2 is the mass
of the second point mass and r is the distance between the two point masses.
Assuming SI units, F is measured in newtons (N), m1 and m2 in kilograms (kg), r in meters
(m), and the constant G is approximately equal to 6,67×10−11N ·m2 · kg−2. Remember that
this is a force of attraction.
For example, consider a man of mass 80 kg standing 10 m from a woman with a mass of 65 kg.
As you can see, these forces are very small.
Now consider the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. The mass of the Earth is
5,98×1024 kg, the mass of the Moon is 7,35×1022 kg and the Earth and Moon are 0,38×109 m
apart. The gravitational force between the Earth and Moon is:
From this example you can see that the force is very large.
These two examples demonstrate that the bigger the masses, the greater the force between them.
The 1/r2 factor tells us that the distance between the two bodies plays a role as well. The closer
two bodies are, the stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational
attraction of the Earth most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it, but if we
were in outer-space, we would barely even know the Earth’s gravity existed!
Remember that
which means that every object on Earth feels the same gravitational acceleration! That means
whether you drop a pen or a book (from the same height), they will both take the same length
of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them
at the same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (Equations 12.2
and 12.3). The force between the Earth (which has the mass me) and an object of mass mo is
Since it doesn’t matter what mo is, this tells us that the acceleration on a body (due to the
Earth’s gravity) does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects experience the same
gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be different but the acceleration will
be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects
we label it differently, instead of using a we use g which we call the gravitational acceleration.


file_data: 12.4.2|Comparative Problems|284
Comparative problems involve calculation of something in terms of something else that we know.
For example, if you weigh 490 N on Earth and the gravitational acceleration on Venus is 0,903
that of the gravitational acceleration on the Earth, then you would weigh 0,903 x 490 N = 442,5 N
on Venus.
Principles for answering comparative problems
• Write out equations and calculate all quantities for the given situation
• Write out all relationships between variable from first and second case
• Write out second case
• Substitute all first case variables into second case
• Write second case in terms of first case

Momentum is a physical quantity which is closely related to forces. Momentum is a property
which applies to moving objects.
Definition: Momentum
Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue to move in its direction of travel.
Momentum is calculated from the product of the mass and velocity of an object.
The momentum (symbol p) of an object of mass m moving at velocity v is:
p = m · v
According to this equation, momentum is related to both the mass and velocity of an object. A
small car travelling at the same velocity as a big truck will have a smaller momentum than the
truck. The smaller the mass, the smaller the velocity.
A car travelling at 120 km·hr−1will have a bigger momentum than the same car travelling at
60 km·hr−1. Momentum is also related to velocity; the smaller the velocity, the smaller the
momentum.
Different objects can also have the same momentum, for example a car travelling slowly can have
the same momentum as a motor cycle travelling relatively fast. We can easily demonstrate this.
Consider a car of mass 1 000 kg with a velocity of 8 m·s−1(about 30 km·hr−1). The momentum
of the car is therefore
Now consider a motor cycle of mass 250 kg travelling at 32 m·s−1 (about 115 km·hr−1). The
momentum of the motor cycle is:
Even though the motor cycle is considerably lighter than the car, the fact that the motor cy-
cle is travelling much faster than the car means that the momentum of both vehicles is the same.
From the calculations above, you are able to derive the unit for momentum as kg·m·s−1.
Momentum is also vector quantity, because it is the product of a scalar (m) with a vector (v).
This means that whenever we calculate the momentum of an object, we need to include the
direction of the momentum.


file_data: 12.5.1|Vector Nature of Momentum|290
As we have said, momentum is a vector quantity. Since momentum is a vector, the techniques
of vector addition discussed in Chapter ?? must be used to calculate the total momentum of a
system.

file_data: 12.5.3|Change in Momentum|291
Let us consider a tennis ball (mass = 0,1 g) that is dropped at an initial velocity of 5 m·s−1and
bounces back at a final velocity of 3 m·s−1. As the ball approaches the floor it has a momentum
that we call the momentum before the collision. When it moves away from the floor it has a
different momentum called the momentum after the collision. The bounce on the floor can be
thought of as a collision taking place where the floor exerts a force on the tennis ball to change
its momentum.
The momentum before the bounce can be calculated as follows:
Because momentum and velocity are vectors, we have to choose a direction as positive. For
this example we choose the initial direction of motion as positive, in other words, downwards is
When the tennis ball bounces back it changes direction. The final velocity will thus have a
negative value. The momentum after the bounce can be calculated as follows:
pafter = m· vf
Now let us look at what happens to the momentum of the tennis ball. The momentum changes
during this bounce. We can calculate the change in momentum as follows:
Again we have to choose a direction as positive and we will stick to our initial choice as down-
wards is positive. This means that the final momentum will have a negative number.
You will notice that this number is bigger than the previous momenta calculated. This is should
be the case as the ball needed to be stopped and then given momentum to bounce back.

file_data: 12.5.5|Newton's Second Law revisited|293
You have learned about Newton’s Second Law of motion earlier in this chapter. Newton’s Second
Law describes the relationship between the motion of an object and the net force on the object.
We said that the motion of an object, and therefore its momentum, can only change when a
resultant force is acting on it. We can therefore say that because a net force causes an object
to move, it also causes its momentum to change. We can now define Newton’s Second Law of
motion in terms of momentum.
Definition: Newton’s Second Law of Motion (N2)
The net or resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum.



file_data: 12.5.6|Impulse|294
Impulse is the product of the net force and the time interval for which the force acts. Impulse is
defined as:

However, from Newton’s Second Law, we know that
Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. From this equation we see, that
for a given change in momentum, Fnett is fixed. Thus, if Fnet is reduced, t must be in-
creased (i.e. a smaller resultant force must be applied for longer to bring about the same change
in momentum). Alternatively if t is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for a shorter
period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum.


file_data: 12.5.7|Exercise|296


file_data: 12.5.8|Conservation of Momentum|297
In the absence of an external force acting on a system, momentum is conserved.
Definition: Conservation of Linear Momentum
The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant. An isolated system has no
forces acting on it from the outside.
This means that in an isolated system the total momentum before a collision or explosion is
equal to the total momentum after the collision or explosion.
Consider a simple collision of two billiard balls. The balls are rolling on a frictionless surface and
the system is isolated. So, we can apply conservation of momentum. The first ball has a mass
m1 and an initial velocity vi1. The second ball has a mass m2 and moves towards the first ball
with an initial velocity vi2. This situation is shown in Figure 12.14.
The total momentum of the system before the collision, pi is:
After the two balls collide and move away they each have a different momentum. If the first
ball has a final velocity of vf1 and the second ball has a final velocity of vf2 then we have the
situation shown in Figure 12.15.
This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. There-
fore, by the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the
collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the
conservation of momentum in a collision of two objects,


file_data: 12.5.9|Physics in Action: Impulse|300
A very important application of impulse is improving safety and reducing injuries. In many cases,
an object needs to be brought to rest from a certain initial velocity. This means there is a
certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can
be increased then the force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage.
This is the principle behind arrestor beds for trucks, airbags, and bending your knees when you
jump off a chair and land on the ground.
Air-Bags in Motor Vehicles
Air bags are used in motor vehicles because they are able to reduce the effect of the force
experienced by a person during an accident. Air bags extend the time required to stop the
momentum of the driver and passenger. During a collision, the motion of the driver and passenger
carries them towards the windshield which results in a large force exerted over a short time in
order to stop their momentum. If instead of hitting the windshield, the driver and passenger hit
an air bag, then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results
in a decrease in the force.
Padding as Protection During Sports
The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are
padded mats in gymnastics. In cricket, when the wicket keeper catches the ball, the padding is
slightly compressible, thus reducing the effect of the force on the wicket keepers hands. Similarly,
if a gymnast falls, the padding compresses and reduces the effect of the force on the gymnast’s
body.
Arrestor Beds for Trucks
An arrestor bed is a patch of ground that is softer than the road. Trucks use these when they
have to make an emergency stop. When a trucks reaches an arrestor bed the time interval over
which the momentum is changed is increased. This decreases the force and causes the truck to
slow down.
Follow-Through in Sports
In sports where rackets and bats are used, like tennis, cricket, squash, badminton and baseball,
the hitter is often encouraged to follow-through when striking the ball. High speed films of the
collisions between bats/rackets and balls have shown that following through increases the time
over which the collision between the racket/bat and ball occurs. This increase in the time of
the collision causes an increase in the velocity change of the ball. This means that a hitter can
cause the ball to leave the racket/bat faster by following through. In these sports, returning the
ball with a higher velocity often increases the chances of success.
Crumple Zones in Cars
Another safety application of trying to reduce the force experienced is in crumple zones in cars.
When two cars have a collision, two things can happen:
1. the cars bounce off each other, or
2. the cars crumple together.
Which situation is more dangerous for the occupants of the cars? When cars bounce off each
other, or rebound, there is a larger change in momentum and therefore a larger impulse. A
larger impulse means that a greater force is experienced by the occupants of the cars. When
cars crumple together, there is a smaller change in momentum and therefore a smaller impulse.
The smaller impulse means that the occupants of the cars experience a smaller force. Car
manufacturers use this idea and design crumple zones into cars, such that the car has a greater
chance of crumpling than rebounding in a collision. Also, when the car crumples, the change in
the car’s momentum happens over a longer time. Both these effects result in a smaller force on
the occupants of the car, thereby increasing their chances of survival.

file_data: 12.6|Torque and Levers|302


file_data: 12.6.1|Torque|302
This chapter has dealt with forces and how they lead to motion in a straight line. In this section,
we examine how forces lead to rotational motion.
When an object is fixed or supported at one point and a force acts on it a distance away from
the support, it tends to make the object turn. The moment of force or torque (symbol, τ read
tau) is defined as the product of the distance from the support or pivot (r) and the component
of force perpendicular to the object, 
Torque can be seen as a rotational force. The unit of torque is N·m and torque is a vector
quantity. Some examples of where torque arises are shown in Figures 12.17, 12.18 and 12.19.
This shows that there is less torque when the force is applied closer to the bolt than further
away.
Important: Loosening a bolt
If you are trying to loosen (or tighten) a bolt, apply the force on the spanner further away from
the bolt, as this results in a greater torque to the bolt making it easier to loosen.
Important: Any component of a force exerted parallel to an object will not cause the object
to turn. Only perpendicular components cause turning.
Important: Torques
The direction of a torque is either clockwise or anticlockwise. When torques are added, choose
one direction as positive and the opposite direction as negative. If equal clockwise and anti-
clockwise torques are applied to an object, they will cancel out and there will be no net turning
effect.



file_data: 12.6.2|Mechanical Advantage and Levers|305
We can use our knowlegde about the moments of forces (torque) to determine whether situations
are balanced. For example two mass pieces are placed on a seesaw as shown in Figure 12.20.
The one mass is 3 kg and the other is 6 kg. The masses are placed a distance 2 m and 1
m, respectively from the pivot. By looking at the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments, we
can determine whether the seesaw will pivot (move) or not. If the sum of the clockwise and
anti-clockwise moments is zero, the seesaw is in equilibrium (i.e. balanced).
The resultant moment is zero as the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments of force are in op-
posite directions and therefore cancel each other.
As we see in Figure 12.20, we can use different distances away from a pivot to balance two
different forces. This principle is applied to a lever to make lifting a heavy object much easier.
Definition: Lever
A lever is a rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to multiply
the mechanical force that can be applied to another object.
Archimedes reputedly said: Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which
to place it, and I shall move the world.
The concept of getting out more than the effort is termed mechanical advantage, and is one
example of the principle of moments. The lever allows to do less effort but for a greater distance.
For instance to lift a certain unit of weight with a lever with an effort of half a unit we need a
distance from the fulcrum in the effort’s side to be twice the distance of the weight’s side. It
also means that to lift the weight 1 meter we need to push the lever for 2 meter. The amount of
work done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the lever (in an ideal lever).
The lever only allows to trade effort for distance.
Ideally, this means that the mechanical advantage of a system is the ratio of the force that
performs the work (output or load) to the applied force (input or effort), assuming there is no
friction in the system. In reality, the mechanical advantage will be less than the ideal value by
an amount determined by the amount of friction.
For example, you want to raise an object of mass 100 kg. If the pivot is placed as shown in
Figure 12.22, what is the mechanical advantage of the lever?
In order to calculate mechanical advantage, we need to determine the load and effort.
Important: Effort is the input force and load is the output force.



file_data: 12.6.3|Classes of levers|307
Class 1 levers
In a class 1 lever the fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Examples of class 1 levers are
the seesaw, crowbar and equal-arm balance. The mechanical advantage of a class 1 lever can be
increased by moving the fulcrum closer to the load.
Class 2 levers
In class 2 levers the fulcrum is at the one end of the bar, with the load closer to the fulcrum and the effort on the other end of bar. The mechanical advantage of this type of lever can be
increased by increasing the length of the bar. A bottle opener or wheel barrow are examples of
class 2 levers.
Class 3 levers
In class 3 levers the fulcrum is also at the end of the bar, but the effort is between the fulcrum
and the load. An example of this type of lever is the human arm.
