(McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). Note, however, that in contrast to the models used
for regression, they are no longer linear in the parameters due to the presence of the
nonlinear function f(·). This will lead to more complex analytical and computa-
tional properties than for linear regression models. Nevertheless, these models are
still relatively simple compared to the more general nonlinear models that will be
studied in subsequent chapters.
The algorithms discussed in this chapter will be equally applicable if we first
make a fixed nonlinear transformation of the input variables using a vector of basis
functions φ(x) as we did for regression models in Chapter 3. We begin by consider-
ing classification directly in the original input space x, while in Section 4.3 we shall
find it convenient to switch to a notation involving basis functions for consistency
with later chapters.
4.1. Discriminant Functions
A discriminant is a function that takes an input vector x and assigns it to one of K
classes, denoted Ck. In this chapter, we shall restrict attention to linear discriminants,
namely those for which the decision surfaces are hyperplanes. To simplify the dis-
cussion, we consider first the case of two classes and then investigate the extension
to K > 2 classes.
