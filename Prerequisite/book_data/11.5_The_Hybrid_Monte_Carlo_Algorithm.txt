As we have already noted, one of the major limitations of the Metropolis algorithm
is that it can exhibit random walk behaviour whereby the distance traversed through
the state space grows only as the square root of the number of steps. The problem
cannot be resolved simply by taking bigger steps as this leads to a high rejection rate.
In this section, we introduce a more sophisticated class of transitions based on an
analogy with physical systems and that has the property of being able to make large
changes to the system state while keeping the rejection probability small. It is ap-
plicable to distributions over continuous variables for which we can readily evaluate
the gradient of the log probability with respect to the state variables. We will discuss
