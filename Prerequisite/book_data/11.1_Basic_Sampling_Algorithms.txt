In this section, we consider some simple strategies for generating random samples
from a given distribution. Because the samples will be generated by a computer
algorithm they will in fact be pseudo-random numbers, that is, they will be deter-
ministically calculated, but must nevertheless pass appropriate tests for randomness.
Generating such numbers raises several subtleties (Press et al., 1992) that lie outside
the scope of this book. Here we shall assume that an algorithm has been provided
that generates pseudo-random numbers distributed uniformly over (0, 1), and indeed
most software environments have such a facility built in.
