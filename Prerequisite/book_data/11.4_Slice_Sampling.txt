We have seen that one of the difficulties with the Metropolis algorithm is the sensi-
tivity to step size. If this is too small, the result is slow decorrelation due to random
walk behaviour, whereas if it is too large the result is inefficiency due to a high rejec-
tion rate. The technique of slice sampling (Neal, 2003) provides an adaptive step size
that is automatically adjusted to match the characteristics of the distribution. Again
it requires that we are able to evaluate the unnormalized distribution
p(z).
Consider first the univariate case. Slice sampling involves augmenting z with
an additional variable u and then drawing samples from the joint (z, u) space. We
shall see another example of this approach when we discuss hybrid Monte Carlo in
Section 11.5. The goal is to sample uniformly from the area under the distribution

and so we can sample from p(z) by sampling from
p(z, u) and then ignoring the u
values. This can be achieved by alternately sampling z and u. Given the value of z
p(z), which is
we evaluate
straightforward. Then we fix u and sample z uniformly from the ‘slice’ through the
distribution defined by {z :
In practice, it can be difficult to sample directly from a slice through the distribu-
tion and so instead we define a sampling scheme that leaves the uniform distribution
p(z, u) invariant, which can be achieved by ensuring that detailed balance is
under
satisfied. Suppose the current value of z is denoted z(τ ) and that we have obtained
a corresponding sample u. The next value of z is obtained by considering a region
zmin � z � zmax that contains z(τ ). It is in the choice of this region that the adap-
tation to the characteristic length scales of the distribution takes place. We want the
region to encompass as much of the slice as possible so as to allow large moves in z
space while having as little as possible of this region lying outside the slice, because
this makes the sampling less efficient.
One approach to the choice of region involves starting with a region containing
z(τ ) having some width w and then testing each of the end points to see if they lie
within the slice.
If either end point does not, then the region is extended in that
direction by increments of value w until the end point lies outside the region. A
candidate value z is then chosen uniformly from this region, and if it lies within the
slice, then it forms z(τ +1). If it lies outside the slice, then the region is shrunk such
that z forms an end point and such that the region still contains z(τ ). Then another

candidate point is drawn uniformly from this reduced region and so on, until a value
of z is found that lies within the slice.
Slice sampling can be applied to multivariate distributions by repeatedly sam-
pling each variable in turn, in the manner of Gibbs sampling. This requires that
we are able to compute, for each component zi, a function that is proportional to
p(zi|z\i).
